31907393	Osteoporosis develops because of impaired bone formation and/or excessive bone resorption. Several pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis has been developed; however, new treatments are still necessary. Cholesterol and estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) promote osteoclasts formation, survival, and cellular fusion and thus become high risk factors of osteoporosis. In this study, we identified that carnosic acid (CA) suppressed bone loss by dual-targeting of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2, a major regulator that regulates cholesterol synthesis) and ERRalpha. Mechanistically, CA reduced nuclear localization of mature SREBP2 and suppressed de novo biogenesis of cholesterol. CA subsequently decreased the interaction between ERRalpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC1beta), resulting in decreased the transcription activity of ERRalpha and its target genes expression. Meanwhile, CA directly bound to the ligand-binding domain of ERRalpha and significantly promoted its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Subsequently, STUB1 was identified as the E3 ligase of ERRalpha. The lysine residues (K51 and K68) are essential for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ERRalpha by CA. In conclusion, CA dually targets SREBP2 and ERRalpha, thus inhibits the RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and improves OVX-induced bone loss. CA may serve as a lead compound for pharmacological control of osteoporosis.	Dual targeting of SREBP2 and ERRalpha by carnosic acid suppresses RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss.	Cell death and differentiation
31959916	Intestinal epithelia self-renew constantly and generate differentiated cells such as secretary goblet cells. The intestine goblet cells secrete gel-forming mucins that form mucus to create a barrier of defense. We reported previously that loss of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 3 led to disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier function. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that PHD3 controls the generation of intestine goblet cell. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in mice intestine epithelial cells reduced the amount of goblet cells. Mechanistically, PHD3 bounds the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 and prevented HUWE1 from mediating ubiquitination and degradation of ATOH1, an essential driver for goblet cell differentiation. The prolyl hydroxylase activity-deficient variant PHD3(H196A) also prevented ATOH1 destruction. A genetic intestine epithelial PHD3(H196A)-knockin had no effect on ATOH1 expression or goblet cell amount in mice, suggesting that the PHD3 prolyl hydroxylase activity is dispensable for its ability to control ATOH1 expression and goblet cell generation. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis, PHD3-knockout rather than PHD3(H196A)-knockin sensitized the mice to DSS treatment. Our results reveal an additional critical mechanism underlying the regulation of ATOH1 expression and goblet cell generation and highlight that PHD3 plays a role in controlling intestine goblet cell generation in a hydroxylase-independent manner.	Prolyl hydroxylase 3 controls the intestine goblet cell generation through stabilizing ATOH1.	Cell death and differentiation
31959915	The identification of viability-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a means of uncovering therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, aberrant genome-wide hypomethylation has been implicated in HCC initiation and progression. However, the relationship between lncRNA dysregulation and genome-wide hypomethylation in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. A novel lncRNA named LINC00662 was previously demonstrated to play a role in gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that this lncRNA was correlated with survival and exhibited oncogenic properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we determined that LINC00662 could lead to genome-wide hypomethylation and alter the genomic methylation profile by synchronously reducing the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level and enhancing the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) level. Mechanistically, LINC00662 was determined to regulate the key enzymes influencing SAM and SAH levels, namely, methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), by RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that some SAM-dependent HCC-promoting genes could be regulated by LINC00662 by altering the methylation status of their promoters via the LINC00662-coupled axes of MAT1A/SAM and AHCY/SAH. Taken together, the results of this this study indicate that LINC00662 could be a potential biomarker for HCC therapy. More importantly, we proposed a new role of lncRNA in regulating genomic methylation to promote oncogene activation.

31992855	Progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and resistance to therapy are affected by tumor microenvironmental factors. One such factor is B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine that is produced mainly by nurse-like cells (NLC) and enhances CLL cells survival and modulates response to therapy. In CLL cells, BAFF activates NF-kappaB signaling, but how NF-kappaB supports CLL survival is not entirely clear. In this study we show that BAFF induces accumulation of the signaling and autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 in a manner dependent on NF-kappaB activation. p62 potentiates mTORC1 signaling and activates NRF2, the master regulator of the anti-oxidant response. We found that expression of NRF2 target genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), is particularly enriched in CLL cells with high ROR1 surface expression (ROR1(Hi)). ROR1(Hi) CLL cells with elevated NQO1 expression exhibit resistance to drugs that induce ROS accumulation, such venetoclax. However, such cells are more sensitive to compound 29h, a pro-drug that only becomes active after being metabolized by NQO1. Accordingly, 29h sensitizes high NQO1 CLL cells to venetoclax. Collectively, our study unravels a previously unknown signaling network through which the NF-kappaB-p62-NRF2 axis protects ROR1-high CLL cells from ROS-inducing therapeutics.	NF-kappaB-p62-NRF2 survival signaling is associated with high ROR1 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Cell death and differentiation
31996779	Heat shock can induce either cytoprotective mechanisms or cell death. We found that in certain human and mouse cells, including spermatocytes, activated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) binds to sequences located in the intron(s) of the PMAIP1 (NOXA) gene and upregulates its expression which induces apoptosis. Such a mode of PMAIP1 activation is not dependent on p53. Therefore, HSF1 not only can activate the expression of genes encoding cytoprotective heat shock proteins, which prevents apoptosis, but it can also positively regulate the proapoptotic PMAIP1 gene, which facilitates cell death. This could be the primary cause of hyperthermia-induced elimination of heat-sensitive cells, yet other pro-death mechanisms might also be involved.

32015502	Angiogenesis plays crucial roles in maintaining the complex operation of central nervous system (CNS) development. The architecture of communication between neurogenesis and angiogenesis is essential to maintain normal brain development and function. Hence, any disruption of neuron-vascular communications may lead to the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular diseases and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Here we demonstrate that neural differentiation and communication are required for vascular development. Regarding the cellular and molecular mechanism, our results show that PRDM16 activity determines the production of mature neurons and their specific positions in the neocortex. In the cortical plate (CP), aberrant neurons fail to secrete modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), an important neuronal signal that participates in neurovascular communication to regulate CNS angiogenesis. Neuronal SMOC1 interacts with TGFBR1 by activating the transcription factors phospho-Smad2/3 to convey intercellular signals to endothelial cells (ECs) in the TGF-beta-Smad signaling pathway. Together, our results highlight a crucial coordinated neurovascular development process orchestrated by PRDM16 and reveal the importance of intimate communication for building the neurovascular network during brain development.	PRDM16 orchestrates angiogenesis via neural differentiation in the developing brain.	Cell death and differentiation
32051546	Rab5 is a master regulator for endosome biogenesis and transport while its in vivo physiological function remains elusive. Here, we find that Rab5a is upregulated in several in vivo and in vitro myogenesis models. By generating myogenic Rab5a-deficient mice, we uncover the essential roles of Rab5a in regulating skeletal muscle regeneration. We further reveal that Rab5a promotes myoblast differentiation and directly interacts with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), an essential scaffold protein for propagating IGF signaling. Rab5a interacts with IRS1 in a GTP-dependent manner and this interaction is enhanced upon IGF-1 activation and myogenic differentiation. We subsequently identify that the arginine 207 and 222 of IRS1 and tyrosine 82, 89, and 90 of Rab5a are the critical amino acid residues for mediating the association. Mechanistically, Rab5a modulates IRS1 activation by coordinating the association between IRS1 and the IGF receptor (IGFR) and regulating the intracellular membrane targeting of IRS1. Both myogenesis-induced and IGF-evoked AKT-mTOR signaling are dependent on Rab5a. Myogenic deletion of Rab5a also reduces the activation of AKT-mTOR signaling during skeletal muscle regeneration. Taken together, our study uncovers the physiological function of Rab5a in regulating muscle regeneration and delineates the novel role of Rab5a as a critical switch controlling AKT-mTOR signaling by activating IRS1.	Rab5a activates IRS1 to coordinate IGF-AKT-mTOR signaling and myoblast differentiation during muscle regeneration.	Cell death and differentiation
32042098	Mitochondria change distribution across cells following a variety of pathophysiological stimuli. The mechanisms presiding over this redistribution are yet undefined. In a murine model overexpressing Drp1 specifically in skeletal muscle, we find marked mitochondria repositioning in muscle fibres and we demonstrate that Drp1 is involved in this process. Drp1 binds KLC1 and enhances microtubule-dependent transport of mitochondria. Drp1-KLC1 coupling triggers the displacement of KIF5B from kinesin-1 complex increasing its binding to microtubule tracks and mitochondrial transport. High levels of Drp1 exacerbate this mechanism leading to the repositioning of mitochondria closer to nuclei. The reduction of Drp1 levels decreases kinesin-1 activation and induces the partial recovery of mitochondrial distribution. Drp1 overexpression is also associated with higher cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk-1) activation that promotes the persistent phosphorylation of desmin at Ser-31 and its disassembling. Fission inhibition has a positive effect on desmin Ser-31 phosphorylation, regardless of Cdk-1 activation, suggesting that induction of both fission and Cdk-1 are required for desmin collapse. This altered desmin architecture impairs mechanotransduction and compromises mitochondrial network stability priming mitochondria transport through microtubule-dependent trafficking with a mechanism that involves the Drp1-dependent regulation of kinesin-1 complex.	Drp1 overexpression induces desmin disassembling and drives kinesin-1 activation promoting mitochondrial trafficking in skeletal muscle.	Cell death and differentiation
32144382	Cancer cells are defective in DNA repair, so they experience increased DNA strand breaks, genome instability, gene mutagenesis, and tumorigenicity; however, multiple classic DNA repair genes and pathways are strongly activated in malignant tumor cells to compensate for the DNA repair deficiency and gain an apoptosis resistance. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in cancer are unclear. We speculate that a key DNA repair gene or signaling pathway in cancer has not yet been recognized. Here, we show that the lipogenic liver X receptor (LXR)-sterol response element binding factor-1 (SREBF1) axis controls the transcription of a key DNA repair gene polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), thereby governing cancer cell DNA repair and apoptosis. Notably, the PNKP levels were significantly reduced in 95% of human pancreatic cancer (PC) patients, particularly deep reduction for sixfold in all of the advanced-stage PC cases. PNKP is also deficient in three other types of cancer that we examined. In addition, the expression of LXRs and SREBF1 was significantly reduced in the tumor tissues from human PC patients compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The newly identified LXR-SREBF1-PNKP signaling pathway is deficient in PC, and the defect in the pathway contributes to the DNA repair deficiency in the cancer. Strikingly, further diminution of the vulnerable LXR-SREBF1-PNKP signaling pathway using a small molecule triptonide, a new LXR antagonist identified in this investigation, at a concentration of 8 nM robustly activated tumor-suppressor p53 and readily elevated cancer cell DNA strand breaks over an apoptotic threshold, and selectively induced PC cell apoptosis, resulting in almost complete elimination of tumors in xenograft mice without obvious complications. Our findings provide new insight into DNA repair and apoptosis in cancer, and offer a new platform for developing novel anticancer therapeutics.	The lipogenic LXR-SREBF1 signaling pathway controls cancer cell DNA repair and apoptosis and is a vulnerable point of malignant tumors for cancer therapy.	Cell death and differentiation
32094511	MCL1, a BCL2 relative, is critical for the survival of many cells. Its turnover is often tightly controlled through both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of proteasomal degradation. Several cell stress signals, including DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, are known to elicit distinct E3 ligases to ubiquitinate and degrade MCL1. Another trigger that drives MCL1 degradation is engagement by NOXA, one of its BH3-only protein ligands, but the mechanism responsible has remained unclear. From an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we discovered that the ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH5, the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2K, and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 co-operate to mark MCL1 for degradation by the proteasome-specifically when MCL1 is engaged by NOXA. This mechanism of degradation also required the MCL1 transmembrane domain and distinct MCL1 lysine residues to proceed, suggesting that the components likely act on the MCL1:NOXA complex by associating with it in a specific orientation within the mitochondrial outer membrane. MTCH2 has not previously been reported to regulate protein stability, but is known to influence the mitochondrial localization of certain key apoptosis regulators and to impact metabolism. We have now pinpointed an essential but previously unappreciated role for MTCH2 in turnover of the MCL1:NOXA complex by MARCH5, further strengthening its links to BCL2-regulated apoptosis.	MARCH5 requires MTCH2 to coordinate proteasomal turnover of the MCL1:NOXA complex.	Cell death and differentiation
32152556	Angiotensin-(1-9) is a peptide from the noncanonical renin-angiotensin system with anti-hypertrophic effects in cardiomyocytes via an unknown mechanism. In the present study we aimed to elucidate it, basing us initially on previous work from our group and colleagues who proved a relationship between disturbances in mitochondrial morphology and calcium handling, associated with the setting of cardiac hypertrophy. Our first finding was that angiotensin-(1-9) can induce mitochondrial fusion through DRP1 phosphorylation. Secondly, angiotensin-(1-9) blocked mitochondrial fission and intracellular calcium dysregulation in a model of norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, preventing the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. To further investigate angiotensin-(1-9) anti-hypertrophic mechanism, we performed RNA-seq studies, identifying the upregulation of miR-129 under angiotensin-(1-9) treatment. miR-129 decreased the transcript levels of the protein kinase A inhibitor (PKIA), resulting in the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that PKA activity is necessary for the effects of angiotensin-(1-9) over mitochondrial dynamics, calcium handling and its anti-hypertrophic effects.

32139900	The elevated expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and increased PARP1 activity, namely, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), have been observed in cardiac remodeling, leading to extreme energy consumption and myocardial damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PARP1 require further study. WWP2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is highly expressed in the heart, but its function there is largely unknown. Here, we clarified the role of WWP2 in the regulation of PARP1 and the impact of this regulatory process on cardiac remodeling. We determined that the knockout of WWP2 specifically in myocardium decreased the level of PARP1 ubiquitination and increased the effects of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced PARP1 and PARylation, in turn aggravating ISO-induced myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, and myocardial fibrosis. Similar findings were obtained in a model of ISO-induced H9c2 cells with WWP2 knockdown, while the reexpression of WWP2 significantly increased PARP1 ubiquitination and decreased PAPR1 and PARylation levels. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation results identified that WWP2 is a novel interacting protein of PARP1 and mainly interacts with its BRCT domain, thus mediating the degradation of PARP1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In addition, lysine 418 (K418) and lysine 249 (K249) were shown to be of critical importance in regulating PARP1 ubiquitination and degradation by WWP2. These findings reveal a novel WWP2-PARP1 signal transduction pathway involved in controlling cardiac remodeling and may provide a basis for exploring new strategies for treating heart disorders related to cardiac remodeling.	Selective targeting of ubiquitination and degradation of PARP1 by E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 regulates isoproterenol-induced cardiac remodeling.	Cell death and differentiation
32332915	Liver dysfunction is strongly associated with poor survival of sepsis patients. Cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing by Caspase-4/5/11 for pyroptosis activation is a major driver of the development of sepsis. Studies in macrophages and endothelial cells have demonstrated that LPS is inactivated by acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) and leading to desensitizing Caspase-4/5/11 to LPS. However, little is known about the cytosolic LPS-induced pyroptosis in hepatocytes during sepsis. Heat shock protein 12A (HSPA12A) is a novel member of the HSP70 family. Here, we report that LPS increased HSPA12A nuclear translocation in hepatocytes, while knockout of HSPA12A (Hspa12a(-/-)) in mice promoted LPS-induced acute liver injury. We also noticed that the LPS-induced Caspase-11 activation and its cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) to produce the membrane pore-forming GSDMD(Nterm) (markers of pyroptosis) were greater in livers of Hspa12a(-/-) mice compared with its wild type controls. Loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that HSPA12A deficiency promoted, whereas HSPA12A overexpression inhibited, cytosolic LPS accumulation, Caspase-11 activation and GSDMD(Nterm) generation in primary hepatocytes following LPS incubation. Notably, LPS-induced AOAH expression was suppressed by HSPA12A deficiency, whereas AOAH overexpression reversed the HSPA12A deficiency-induced promotion of LPS-evoked and Caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis of hepatocytes. In-depth molecular analysis showed that HSPA12A interacted directly with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and increased its nuclear translocation, thereby inducing AOAH expression for cytosolic LPS inactivation, which ultimately leading to inhibition of the Caspase-11 mediated pyroptosis of hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings revealed HSPA12A as a novel player against LPS-induced liver injury by inhibiting cytosolic LPS-induced hepatocyte pyroptosis via PGC-1alpha-mediated AOAH expression. Therefore, targeting hepatocyte HSPA12A represents a viable strategy for the management of liver injury in sepsis patients.	HSPA12A attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury through inhibiting caspase-11-mediated hepatocyte pyroptosis via PGC-1alpha-dependent acyloxyacyl hydrolase expression.

32313199	TRAIL-R2 (DR5) is a clinically-relevant therapeutic target and a key target for immune effector cells. Herein, we identify a novel interaction between TRAIL-R2 and the Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box (SCF) Cullin-Ring E3 Ubiquitin Ligase complex containing Skp2 (SCF(Skp2)). We find that SCF(Skp2) can interact with both TRAIL-R2's pre-ligand association complex (PLAC) and ligand-activated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). Moreover, Cullin-1 interacts with TRAIL-R2 in its active NEDDylated form. Inhibiting Cullin-1's DISC recruitment using the NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) or siRNA increased apoptosis induction in response to TRAIL. This correlated with enhanced levels of the caspase-8 regulator FLIP at the TRAIL-R2 DISC, particularly the long splice form, FLIP(L). We subsequently found that FLIP(L) (but not FLIP(S), caspase-8, nor the other core DISC component FADD) interacts with Cullin-1 and Skp2. Importantly, this interaction is enhanced when FLIP(L) is in its DISC-associated, C-terminally truncated p43-form. Prevention of FLIP(L) processing to its p43-form stabilises the protein, suggesting that by enhancing its interaction with SCF(Skp2), cleavage to the p43-form is a critical step in FLIP(L) turnover. In support of this, we found that silencing any of the components of the SCF(Skp2) complex inhibits FLIP ubiquitination, while overexpressing Cullin-1/Skp2 enhances its ubiquitination in a NEDDylation-dependent manner. DISC recruitment of TRAF2, previously identified as an E3 ligase for caspase-8 at the DISC, was also enhanced when Cullin-1's recruitment was inhibited, although its interaction with Cullin-1 was found to be mediated indirectly via FLIP(L). Notably, the interaction of p43-FLIP(L) with Cullin-1 disrupts its ability to interact with FADD, caspase-8 and TRAF2. Collectively, our results suggest that processing of FLIP(L) to p43-FLIP(L) at the TRAIL-R2 DISC enhances its interaction with co-localised SCF(Skp2), leading to disruption of p43-FLIP(L)'s interactions with other DISC components and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis.	The SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex modulates TRAIL-R2-induced apoptosis by regulating FLIP(L).	Cell death and differentiation
32327714	ErbB2 overexpression identifies a subclass of breast cancer as ErbB2-positive that is frequently associated with poor prognosis. Current ErbB2-targeted therapies have profoundly improved patient outcomes, but mutations occurring in ErbB2 have been shown to confer drug resistance. Induction of ErbB2 degradation was proposed as an intriguing strategy to battle with ErbB2-positive breast cancer and reduced mutation-incurred drug resistance. Although multiple HSP90 inhibitors have been demonstrated to effectively trigger ErbB2 degradation, none succeeded in the clinical evaluations. To develop novel ErbB2-targeting strategies, we investigated the endocytic degradation and reversible ubiquitylation of ErbB2 in breast cancer. In this study, we reveal that HSP90 inhibition leads to efficient ubiquitylation and endocytic degradation of ErbB2 through the canonical endo-lysosomal route. USP2 associates with internalized ErbB2 and prevents its lysosomal sorting and degradation via exerting deubiquitylase activity. Accordingly, the USP2 inhibitor ML364 is capable of inducing ErbB2 ubiquitylation and accelerating its turnover. ML364 potentiates the pro-degradation effects of HSP90 inhibitors on ErbB2 and hence sensitizes ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition. The combination of USP2 and HSP90 inhibitors effectively restrains ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Based on these observations, we conclude that USP2 safeguards ErbB2 surface levels by antagonizing its ubiquitylation-mediated endocytic degradation, which can be exploited to design novel therapeutic strategies against ErbB2-driven malignancies as combinatorial treatment with HSP90 inhibitors.	The deubiquitylase USP2 maintains ErbB2 abundance via counteracting endocytic degradation and represents a therapeutic target in ErbB2-positive breast cancer.	Cell death and differentiation
32346136	The Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) is a stimulation-dependent form of apoptosis used by the organism to shutdown T-cell response once the source of inflammation has been eliminated, while allowing the generation of immune memory. AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.	JNK1 and ERK1/2 modulate lymphocyte homeostasis via BIM and DRP1 upon AICD induction.	Cell death and differentiation
32332916	Although the roles of the Hippo pathway in organogenesis and tumorigenesis have been well studied in multiple organs, its role in sperm maturation and male fertility has not been investigated. The initial segment (IS) of the epididymis plays a critical role in sperm maturation. IS differentiation is governed by ERK1/2, but the mechanisms of ERK1/2 activation in IS are not fully understood. Here we show that double knockout (dKO) of mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2), homologs of Hippo in Drosophila, in the epididymal epithelium led to male infertility in mice. Sperm in the cauda epididymides of mutant mice were immotile with flagellar angulation and severely disorganized structures. Loss of Mst1/2 activated YAP and increased proliferation and cell death in all the segments of epididymis. The mutant mice showed substantially suppressed MEK/ERK signaling in the IS and failed IS differentiation. Deletion of Yap restored the reduced MEK/ERK signaling, and partially rescued the defective IS differentiation and fertility in Mst1/2 dKO mice. Our results demonstrate that YAP inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway in IS epithelial cells, and MST1/2 control IS differentiation and fertility at least partially by repressing YAP. Taken together, the Hippo pathway is essential for sperm maturation and male fertility.	Hippo kinases MST1 and MST2 control the differentiation of the epididymal initial segment via the MEK-ERK pathway.	Cell death and differentiation
32424140	Pathological cardiac hypertrophy eventually leads to heart failure without adequate treatment. REGgamma is emerging as 11S proteasome activator of 20S proteasome to promote the degradation of cellular proteins in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Here, we found that REGgamma was significantly upregulated in the transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced hypertrophic hearts and angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated cardiomyocytes. REGgamma deficiency ameliorated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy were associated with inhibition of cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and suppression of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acalpha) decay. Mechanistically, REGgamma interacted with and targeted PP2Acalpha for degradation directly, thereby leading to increase of phosphorylation levels and nuclear export of Forkhead box protein O (FoxO) 3a and subsequent of SOD2 decline, ROS accumulation, and cardiac hypertrophy. Introducing exogenous PP2Acalpha or SOD2 to human cardiomyocytes significantly rescued the REGgamma-mediated ROS accumulation of Ang II stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP prevented cardiac ROS production and hypertrophy features that REGgamma caused in vivo, thereby establishing a REGgamma-PP2Acalpha-FoxO3a-SOD2 pathway in cardiac oxidative stress and hypertrophy, indicates modulating the REGgamma-proteasome activity may be a potential therapeutic approach in cardiac hypertrophy-associated disorders.

32424142	The mesenchymal transcription factor forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) is a critical regulator of embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Our previous studies demonstrated that FOXF2 is ectopically expressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells and that FOXF2 deficiency promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and aggressiveness of BLBC cells. In this study, we found that FOXF2 controls transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/SMAD signaling pathway activation through transrepression of TGF-beta-coding genes in BLBC cells. FOXF2-deficient BLBC cells adopt a myofibroblast-/cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype, and tend to metastasize to visceral organs by increasing autocrine TGF-beta signaling and conferring aggressiveness to neighboring cells by increasing paracrine TGF-beta signaling. In turn, TGF-beta silences FOXF2 expression through upregulating miR-182-5p, a posttranscriptional regulator of FOXF2 and inducer of metastasis. In addition to mediating a reciprocal repression loop between FOXF2 and TGF-beta through direct transrepression by SMAD3, miR-182-5p forms a reciprocal repression loop with FOXF2 that directly transrepresses MIR182 expression. Therefore, FOXF2 deficiency accelerates the visceral metastasis of BLBC through unrestricted increases in autocrine and paracrine TGF-beta signaling, and miR-182-5p expression. Our findings provide novel mechanisms underlying the roles of TGF-beta, miR-182-5p, and FOXF2 in accelerating BLBC dissemination and metastasis, and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for aggressive BLBC.

32415280	Conventional screening methods for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have important limitations. A loss-of-function study based on the knockout of DUB genes in mammalian cells can provide an excellent model for exploring DUB function. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to perform genome-scale knockout of the entire set of genes encoding ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), a DUB subfamily, and then systematically screened for DUBs that stabilize the Cdc25A oncoprotein. USP3 was identified as a deubiquitinase of Cdc25A. USP3 depletion reduces the Cdc25A protein level, resulting in a significant delay in cell-cycle progression, and reduces the growth of cervical tumor xenografts in nude mice. Clinically, USP3 expression is positively correlated with Cdc25A protein expression and the poorest survival in breast cancer. We envision that our DUB knockout library kit will facilitate genome-scale screening of functional DUBs for target proteins of interest in a wide range of biomedical fields.

32424143	The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family is closely related to the progression of glioma. To ensure the clinical significance of LOX family in glioma, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was mined and the analysis indicated that higher LOXL1 expression was correlated with more malignant glioma progression. The functions of LOXL1 in promoting glioma cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis were studied by gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cells and animals. LOXL1 was found to exhibit antiapoptotic activity by interacting with multiple antiapoptosis modulators, especially BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 2 (BAG2). LOXL1-D515 interacted with BAG2-K186 through a hydrogen bond, and its lysyl oxidase activity prevented BAG2 degradation by competing with K186 ubiquitylation. Then, we discovered that LOXL1 expression was specifically upregulated through the VEGFR-Src-CEBPA axis. Clinically, the patients with higher LOXL1 levels in their blood had much more abundant BAG2 protein levels in glioma tissues. Conclusively, LOXL1 functions as an important mediator that increases the antiapoptotic capacity of tumor cells, and approaches targeting LOXL1 represent a potential strategy for treating glioma. In addition, blood LOXL1 levels can be used as a biomarker to monitor glioma progression.	LOXL1 confers antiapoptosis and promotes gliomagenesis through stabilizing BAG2.

32424141	CD4/CD8 T-cell lineage differentiation is a key process in immune system development; however, a defined regulator(s) that converts the signal from T-cell receptor and co-receptor complexes into lineage differentiation remains unclear. Here, we show that Twist2 is a critical factor in CD4/CD8 thymocyte differentiation. Twist2 expression is differentially regulated by T-cell receptor signaling, leading to differentiation into the CD4 or CD8 lineage. Forced Twist2 expression perturbed CD4(+) thymocyte differentiation while enhancing CD8(+) thymocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Twist2 expression produced mature CD8(+) thymocytes in B2m(-/-) mice, while its deficiency significantly impaired CD8(+) cells in MHC class-II(-/)(-) and TCR transgenic mice, favoring CD8 T-cell differentiation. During CD8 lineage differentiation, Twist2 interacted with Runx3 to bind to the silencer region of the ThPOK locus, thereby blocking ThPOK expression. These findings indicate that Twist2 is a part of the transcription factor network controlling CD8 lineage differentiation.

32457484	Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death caused by formation of the necrosome complex. However, the factors modulating this process and the systemic pathophysiological effects of necroptosis are yet to be understood. Here, we identified that Beclin 1 functions as an anti-necroptosis factor by being recruited into the necrosome complex upon treatment with TNFalpha, Smac mimetic, and pan-caspase inhibitor and by repressing MLKL oligomerisation, thus preventing the disruption of the plasma membrane. Cells ablated or knocked-out for Beclin 1 become sensitised to necroptosis in an autophagy-independent manner without affecting the necrosome formation itself. Interestingly, the recruitment of Beclin 1 into the necrosome complex is dependent on the activation and phosphorylation of MLKL. Biochemically, the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of Beclin 1 binds to the CCD of MLKL, which restrains the oligomerisation of phosphorylated MLKL. Finally, Beclin 1 depletion was found to promote necroptosis in leukaemia cells and enhance regression of xenografted-tumour upon treatment with Smac mimetics and caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that Beclin 1 functions as a negative regulator in the execution of necroptosis by suppressing MLKL oligomerisation.	Beclin 1 functions as a negative modulator of MLKL oligomerisation by integrating into the necrosome complex.	Cell death and differentiation
32467643	Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays multiple roles in many physiological processes and its dysregulation leads to congenital disorders and cancers. Hh regulates the cellular localization of Smoothened (Smo) and the stability of Cubitus interruptus (Ci) to fine-tune the signal outputs. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that the scaffold protein Rack1 plays dual roles in Hh signaling. In the absence of Hh, Rack1 promotes Ci and Cos2 to form a Ci-Rack1-Cos2 complex, culminating in Slimb-mediated Ci proteolysis. In the presence of Hh, Rack1 dissociates from Ci-Rack1-Cos2 complex and forms a trimeric complex with Smo and Usp8, leading to Smo deubiquitination and cell surface accumulation. Furthermore, we find the regulation of Rack1 on Hh pathway is conserved from Drosophila to mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that Rack1 plays dual roles during Hh signal transduction and provide Rack1 as a potential drug target for Hh-related diseases.

32494025	Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is the crucial factor in ERalpha-positive breast cancer progression. Endocrine therapies targeting ERalpha signaling is one of the widely used therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. However, a large number of the patients become refractory to therapy. Abnormal expression of ERalpha co-regulator facilitates breast cancer development and tendency of endocrine resistance. Thus, it is necessary to discover the novel co-regulators modulating ERalpha action. Here, we demonstrate that histone deubiquitinase USP22 is highly expressed in breast cancer samples compared with that in the benign tissue, and high expression of USP22 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival in BCa samples. Moreover, USP22 associates with ERalpha to be involved in maintenance of ERalpha stability. USP22 enhances ERalpha-induced transactivation. We further provide the evidence that USP22 is recruited together with ERalpha to cis-regulatory elements of ERalpha target gene. USP22 promotes cell growth even under hypoxia condition and with the treatment of ERalpha antagonist in breast cancer cells. Importantly, the deubiquitination activity of USP22 is required for its functions on maintenance of ERalpha stability, thereby enhancing ERalpha action and conferring endocrine resistance in breast cancer.	USP22 positively modulates ERalpha action via its deubiquitinase activity in breast cancer.	Cell death and differentiation
32483383	Ovarian tumour domain-containing protein 3 (OTUD3), a key OTU (ovarian tumour protease) family deubiquitylase, plays context-dependent roles in cancers. It suppresses tumorigenesis in breast, colon, liver and cervical cancer through stabilizing PTEN (phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10) while promotes lung tumorigenesis through stabilizing GRP78 (The glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa). The regulation especially post-translational modification of OTUD3 remains unclear. Here, we report that the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a ubiquitin ligase for OTUD3. CHIP interacts with, polyubiquitylates OTUD3 and promotes OTUD3 degradation. Knockdown of CHIP stabilizes OTUD3 which leads to elevated GRP78 levels in lung cancer cells. CHIP-knockdown lung cancer cells exhibit increased invasion in OTUD3 and GRP78 dependent manner. Further study demonstrates that CHIP-knockdown lung cancer cells are more prone to metastasize to mice lung when injected intravenously or subcutaneously. Moreover, the expression of CHIP is low in human lung cancer tissues and inversely correlates with OTUD3 expression and GRP78 expression. Furthermore, we identified CHIP mutations in human lung cancers, which reduce CHIP catalytic activity. These findings demonstrate that CHIP is a negative regulator of OTUD3 and CHIP suppresses lung cancer metastasis through inhibiting OTUD3-GRP78 signaling axis.	Ubiquitin ligase CHIP regulates OTUD3 stability and suppresses tumour metastasis in lung cancer.	Cell death and differentiation
32895488	Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a key histone methyltransferase and EMT inducer, is overexpressed in diverse carcinomas, including breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of EZH2 dysregulation in cancers are still largely unknown. Here, we discover that EZH2 is asymmetrically dimethylated at R342 (meR342-EZH2) by PRMT1. meR342-EZH2 was found to inhibit the CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of EZH2 at T345 and T487, thereby attenuating EZH2 ubiquitylation mediated by the E3 ligase TRAF6. We also demonstrate that meR342-EZH2 resulted in a decrease in EZH2 target gene expression, but an increase in breast cancer cell EMT, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, we confirm the positive correlations among PRMT1, meR342-EZH2 and EZH2 expression in the breast cancer tissues. Finally, we report that high expression levels of meR342-EZH2 predict a poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Our findings may provide a novel diagnostic target and promising therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis.	Methylation of EZH2 by PRMT1 regulates its stability and promotes breast cancer metastasis.	Cell death and differentiation
32587378	Early studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) might play important roles in the regulating of the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its linkage to the surrounding macrophages and their impacts on the HCC progression remain unclear. Here we found that macrophages in liver cancer might function via altering the microRNA, miR-92a-2-5p, in exosomes to decrease liver cancer cells AR expression, which might then lead to increase the liver cancer cells invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that miR-92a-2-5p from the exosomes could target the 3'UTR of AR mRNA to suppress AR translation, altering the PHLPP/p-AKT/beta-catenin signaling to increase liver cancer cells invasion. Preclinical studies demonstrated that targeting this newly identified signaling with miR-92a-2-5p inhibitors led to suppress liver cancer progression. Together, these findings suggest that macrophages in the liver cancer tumor microenvironment may function via exosomes to regulate liver cancer progression, and targeting this newly identified macrophages/exosomes-miR-92a-2-5p/AR/PHLPP/p-AKT/beta-catenin signaling may help in the development of novel treatment strategies to better suppress liver cancer progression.

32555448	The development of skeletal muscle requires progression of a highly ordered cascade of events comprising myogenic lineage commitment, myoblast proliferation, and terminal differentiation. The process of myogenesis is controlled by several myogenic transcription factors that act as terminal effectors of signaling cascades and produce appropriate developmental stage-specific transcripts. PHD finger protein 20 (PHF20) is a multidomain protein and subunit of a lysine acetyltransferase complex that acetylates histone H4 and p53, but its function is unclear. Notably, it has been reported that PHF20 knockout mice die shortly after birth and display a wide variety of phenotypes within the skeletal and hematopoietic systems. Therefore, the putative role of PHF20 in myogenic differentiation was further investigated. In the present study, we found that protein and mRNA expression levels of PHF20 were decreased during myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. At the same time, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) was also decreased during myogenic differentiation. PHF20 overexpression increased YY1 expression during myogenic differentiation, together with a delay in MyoD expression. PHF20 expression enhanced the transcriptional activity of YY1 while shRNA-mediated depletion of PHF20 resulted in the reduction of YY1 promoter activity in C2C12 cells. In addition, PHF20 directly bounds to the YY1 promoter in C2C12 cells. In a similar manner, YY1 expression was elevated while myosin heavy chain expression was decreased in PHF20 transgenic (TG) mice. Histological analysis revealed abnormalities in the shape and length of muscles in PHF20-TG mice. Furthermore, PHF20-TG muscles slowly regenerated after cardiotoxin injection, indicating that PHF20 affected muscle differentiation and regeneration after injury in vivo. Taken together, these results suggested that PHF20 plays an important role in myogenic differentiation by regulating YY1.	Yin Yang 1 is required for PHD finger protein 20-mediated myogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo.	Cell death and differentiation
32678307	Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignant tumor of female reproductive system. It is well-known that induction of STING-mediated type I interferons can enhance the resultant antitumor activity. However, STING pathway is usually inactivated in cancer cells at multiple levels. Here, we identified deubiquitinase USP35 is upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues. High level of USP35 was correlated with diminished CD8(+) T cell infiltration and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found that silencing USP35 reinforces the activation of STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway and promotes the expression of type I interferons. Our data further showed that USP35 can directly deubiquitinate and inactivate STING. Interestingly, activation of STING promotes its binding to USP35 in a STING phosphorylation-dependent manner. Functionally, we found that knockdown of USP35 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to the DNA-damage chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Overall, our study indicates that upregulation of USP35 may be a mechanism of the restricted STING activity in cancer cells, and highlights the significance of USP35 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

32737443	ABSTRICT: LINC00941 is a novel lncRNA that has been found to exhibit protumorigenic and prometastatic behaviors during tumorigenesis. However, its role in metastatic CRC remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of LINC00941 in CRC metastasis. LINC00941 was shown to be upregulated in CRC, and upregulated LINC00941 was associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, LINC00941 promoted migratory and invasive capacities and accelerated lung metastasis in nude mice. Mechanistically, LINC00941 activated EMT in CRC cells, as indicated by the increased expression of key molecular markers of cell invasion and metastasis (Vimentin, Fibronectin, and Twist1) and simultaneous decreased expression of the main invasion suppressors E-cadherin and ZO-1. LINC00941 was found to activate EMT by directly binding the SMAD4 protein MH2 domain and competing with beta-TrCP to prevent SMAD4 protein degradation, thus activating the TGF-beta/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. Our data reveal the essential role of LINC00941 in metastatic CRC via activation of the TGF-beta/SMAD2/3 axis, which provides new insight into the mechanism of metastatic CRC and a novel potential therapeutic target for advanced CRC.

32770107	SUMO E3 ligases specify protein substrates for SUMOylation. The SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and TIF1gamma target the transcriptional regulator SnoN for SUMOylation leading to suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Whether and how TIF1gamma and PIAS1 might coordinate SnoN SUMOylation and regulation of EMT remained unknown. Here, we reveal that SnoN associates simultaneously with both TIF1gamma and PIAS1, leading to a trimeric protein complex. Hence, PIAS1 and TIF1gamma collaborate to promote the SUMOylation of SnoN. Importantly, loss of function studies of PIAS1 and TIF1gamma suggest that these E3 ligases act in an interdependent manner to suppress EMT of breast cell-derived tissue organoids. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel mechanism by which SUMO E3 ligases coordinate substrate SUMOylation with biological implications.

32801355	Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) activation via autophosphorylation is the central cellular response to stress that promotes cell death or apoptosis. However, the key factors and mechanisms behind the simultaneous activation of pro-survival signaling pathways remain unknown. We have discovered a novel regulatory mechanism for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis that relies on the phosphorylation interplay between sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and PKR during exogenous stress. We identified SPHK1 as a previously unrecognized PKR substrate. Phosphorylated SPHK1, a central kinase, mediates the activation of PKR-induced pro-survival pathways by the S1P/S1PR1/MAPKs/IKKalpha signal axis, and antagonizes PKR-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signal transduction under stress conditions. Otherwise, phosphorylated SPHK1 also acts as the negative feedback factor, preferentially binding to the latent form of PKR at the C-terminal kinase motif, inhibiting the homodimerization of PKR, suppressing PKR autophosphorylation, and reducing the signaling strength for cell death and apoptosis. Our results suggest that the balance of the activation levels between PKR and SPHK1, a probable hallmark of homeostasis maintenance, determines cell fate during cellular stress response.

32814878	Anthracyclines are a class of conventional and commonly used frontline chemotherapy drugs to treat breast cancer. However, the anthracycline-based regimens can only reduce breast cancer mortality by 20-30%. Furthermore, there is no appropriate biomarker for predicting responses to this kind of chemotherapy currently. Here we report our findings that may fill this gap by showing the AQP1 (Aquaporin1) protein as a potential response predictor in the anthracycline chemotherapy. We showed that breast cancer patients with a high level of AQP1 expression who underwent the anthracycline treatment had a better clinical outcome relative to those with a low level of AQP1 expression. In the exploration of the underlying mechanisms, we found that the AQP1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) competitively interacted with the 12 armadillo repeats of beta-catenin, followed by the inhibition of the beta-catenin degradation that led to beta-catenin's accumulation in the cytoplasm and nuclear translocation. The nuclear beta-catenin interacted with TopoIIalpha and enhanced TopoIIalpha's activity, which resulted in a high sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anthracyclines. We also found, the miR-320a-3p can attenuate the anthracycline's chemosensitivity by inhibiting the AQP1 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest the efficacy of AQP1 as a response predictor in the anthracycline chemotherapy. The application of our study includes, but is not limited to, facilitating screening of the most appropriate breast cancer patients (who have a high AQP1 expression) for better anthracycline chemotherapy and improved prognosis purposes.

32814880	NF-kappaB signaling plays a critical role in tumor growth and treatment resistance in GBM as in many other cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying high, constitutive NF-kappaB activity in GBM remains to be elucidated. Here, we screened a panel of tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins and identified TRIM22 as a potential activator of NF-kappaB using an NF-kappaB driven luciferase reporter construct in GBM cell lines. Knockout of TRIM22 using Cas9-sgRNAs led to reduced GBM cell proliferation, while TRIM22 overexpression enhanced proliferation of cell populations, in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model. However, two TRIM22 mutants, one with a critical RING-finger domain deletion and the other with amino acid changes at two active sites of RING E3 ligase (C15/18A), were both unable to promote GBM cell proliferation over controls, thus implicating E3 ligase activity in the growth-promoting properties of TRIM22. Co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that TRIM22 bound a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha (IkappaBalpha), and accelerated its degradation by inducing K48-linked ubiquitination. TRIM22 also formed a complex with the NF-kappaB upstream regulator IKKgamma and promoted K63-linked ubiquitination, which led to the phosphorylation of both IKKalpha/beta and IkappaBalpha. Expression of a non-phosphorylation mutant, srIkappaBalpha, inhibited the growth-promoting properties of TRIM22 in GBM cell lines. Finally, TRIM22 was increased in a cohort of primary GBM samples on a tissue microarray, and high expression of TRIM22 correlated with other clinical parameters associated with progressive gliomas, such as wild-type IDH1 status. In summary, our study revealed that TRIM22 activated NF-kappaB signaling through posttranslational modification of two critical regulators of NF-kappaB signaling in GBM cells.

32811973	Mitotic catastrophe (MC) is an important oncosuppressive mechanism that serves to eliminate cells that become polyploid or aneuploid due to aberrant mitosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation and catalytic function of caspase-2 are key steps in MC to trigger apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest of mitotically defective cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate caspase-2 activation and its function are unclear. Here, we identify six new phosphorylation sites in caspase-2 and show that a key mitotic kinase, Aurora B kinase (AURKB), phosphorylates caspase-2 at the highly conserved residue S384. We demonstrate that phosphorylation at S384 blocks caspase-2 catalytic activity and apoptosis function in response to mitotic insults, without affecting caspase-2 dimerisation. Moreover, molecular modelling suggests that phosphorylation at S384 may affect substrate binding by caspase-2. We propose that caspase-2 S384 phosphorylation by AURKB is a key mechanism that controls caspase-2 activation during mitosis.	Phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase regulates caspase-2 activity and function.	Cell death and differentiation
32814877	STAT1 is a master regulator that orchestrates type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN)-induced IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. The mechanisms by which STAT1 is phosphorylated and activated upon IFN signaling remain elusive. Our work demonstrated that ubiquitination of STAT1 mediated by the E3 ligase RNF220 contributed significantly to STAT1 activation and innate immune responses. Rnf220 gene deficiency resulted in the downregulation of IFN signaling and decreased expression of ISGs in response to type 1 and 2 IFNs stimulation and Acinetobacter baumannii and HSV-1 infection. Mechanistically, RNF220 interacted with STAT1 and mediated the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1 at residue K110, which promoted the interaction between STAT1 and the kinase JAK1. The expression of RNF220 was induced by pathogenic infection and IFN signaling. RNF220 promoted STAT1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation through a positive feedback loop. RNF220 haploinsufficiency impaired IFN signaling, and RNF220-defective mice were more susceptible to A. baumannii and HSV-1 infection than WT mice. Our work offers novel insights into the mechanisms of STAT1 modulation and provides potential therapeutic targets against bacterial and viral infection and inflammatory diseases.

32901121	UBE2O, an E2/E3 hybrid ubiquitin-protein ligase, has been implicated in the regulation of adipogenesis, erythroid differentiation, and tumor proliferation. However, its role in cancer radioresistance remains completely unknown. Here, we uncover that UBE2O interacts and targets Mxi1 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K46 residue. Furthermore, we show that genetical or pharmacological blockade of UBE2O impairs tumor progression and radioresistance in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, and these effects can be restored by Mxi1 inhibition. Moreover, we demonstrate that UBE2O is overexpressed and negatively correlated with Mxi1 protein levels in lung cancer tissues. Collectively, our work reveals that UBE2O facilitates tumorigenesis and radioresistance by promoting Mxi1 ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that UBE2O is an attractive radiosensitization target for the treatment of lung cancer.

32929219	Clinical response to immunotherapy is closely associated with the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), and influenced by the dynamic interaction between tumour cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Here, we show that high levels of miR-142-5p positively correlate with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in tumour-associated lymphatic vessels in advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The miR-142-5p is transferred by CSCC-secreted exosomes into LECs to exhaust CD8(+) T cells via the up-regulation of lymphatic IDO expression, which was abrogated by an IDO inhibitor. Mechanistically, miR-142-5p directly down-regulates lymphatic AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 2 (ARID2) expression, inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) recruitment to interferon (IFN)-gamma promoter, and enhances IFN-gamma transcription by suppressing promoter methylation, thereby leading to elevated IDO activity. Furthermore, increased serum exosomal miR-142-5p levels and the consequent IDO activity positively correlate with CSCC progression. In conclusion, exosomes secreted by CSCC cells deliver miR-142-5p to LECs and induce IDO expression via ARID2-DNMT1-IFN-gamma signalling to suppress and exhaust CD8(+) T cells. Our study suggests that LECs act as an integral component of the immune checkpoint(s) in the TME and may serve as a potential new target for CSCC diagnosis and treatment.

33037394	Dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death is a central feature of malignances. Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) regulates programmed cell death including apoptosis and autophagy. Our previous study showed that DAPK3 downregulation was detected in more than half of gastric cancers (GCs), which was related to tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying DAPK3-mediated tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, we showed that the tumor suppressive function of DAPK3 was dependent on autophagy process. Mass spectrometry, in vitro kinase assay, and immunoprecipitation revealed that DAPK3 increased ULK1 activity by direct ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser556. ULK1 phosphorylation by DAPK3 facilitates the ULK1 complex formation, the VPS34 complex activation, and autophagy induction upon starvation. The kinase activity of DAPK3 and ULK1 Ser556 phosphorylation were required for DAPK3-modulated tumor suppression. The coordinate expression of DAPK3 with ULK1 Ser556 phosphorylation was confirmed in clinical GC samples, and this co-expression was correlated with favorable survival outcomes in patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that the tumor-suppressor roles of DAPK3 in GC are associated with autophagy and that DAPK3 is a novel autophagy regulator, which can directly phosphorylate ULK1 and activate ULK1. Thus, DAPK3 might be a promising prognostic autophagy-associated marker.	DAPK3 inhibits gastric cancer progression via activation of ULK1-dependent autophagy.	Cell death and differentiation
33110214	The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates a variety of physiological processes, including cell growth and cancer progression. The regulatory mechanisms of these signals are extremely complex and comprise many feedback loops. Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ovarian tumor domain-containing protein 5 (OTUD5) as a novel positive regulator of the mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 signaling pathways. We demonstrated that OTUD5 stabilized beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 1 (betaTrCP1) proteins via its deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, leading to the degradation of Disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), which is an inhibitory protein of mTORC1 and 2. We also showed that mTOR directly phosphorylated OTUD5 and activated its DUB activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that OTUD5 regulates the downstream gene expression of mTOR. Additionally, OTUD5 depletion elicited several mTOR-related phenotypes such as decreased cell size and increased autophagy in mammalian cells as well as the suppression of a dRheb-induced curled wing phenotype by RNA interference of Duba, a fly ortholog of OTUD5, in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, OTUD5 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of the cancer cell lines with mutations activating mTOR pathway. Our results suggested a positive feedback loop between OTUD5 and mTOR signaling pathway.	Deubiquitinase OTUD5 is a positive regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways.

33082515	Telomeres are transcribed into telomeric RNA termed as TERRA. However, the transcription itself and excessive TERRA may interfere with telomere replication during S phase. The mechanism that coordinates telomere transcription and replication is unknown. Here, we report that TCOF1 leaves the nucleolus and is recruited to telomeres specifically during S phase by interacting with TRF2. Therein, TCOF1 acts to suppress telomere transcription by binding and inhibiting Pol II. Thus, TERRA is limited to low levels in S phase. Depletion of TCOF1 leads to abnormally elevated TERRA and formation of DNA/RNA hybrids (R-loops) at telomeres, which induces replication fork stalling and fragile telomeres. Importantly, telomere replication defect induced by TCOF1 deficiency can be rescued by either masking TERRA or expressing an R-loop eraser RNase H1, demonstrating a critical role of TCOF1 in coordinating telomere transcription and replication. These findings link nucleolus to telomeres and uncover a novel function of TCOF1 on ensuring telomere integrity.	TRF2 recruits nucleolar protein TCOF1 to coordinate telomere transcription and replication.	Cell death and differentiation
33100324	Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. The post-translational phosphorylation modulations of TFEB by mTOR and ERK signaling can determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and activity in response to nutrient availability. However, regulations of TFEB at translational level are rarely known. Here, we found that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor, decreased levels of nuclear TFEB to inhibit lysosome biogenesis and function. Mechanistically, PDCD4 reduces global pool of TFEB by suppressing TFEB translation in an eIF4A-dependent manner, rather than influencing mTOR- and ERK2-dependnet TFEB nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Both of MA3 domains within PDCD4 are required for TFEB translation inhibition. Furthermore, TFEB is required for PDCD4-mediated lysosomal function suppression. In the tumor microenvironment, PDCD4 deficiency promotes the anti-tumor effect of macrophage via enhancing TFEB expression. Our research reveals a novel PDCD4-dependent TFEB translational regulation and supports PDCD4 as a potential therapeutic target for lysosome dysfunction related diseases.

33162555	CRSP8 plays an important role in recruiting mediators to genes through direct interaction with various DNA-bound transactivators. In this study, we uncovered the unique function of CRSP8 in suppressing thyroid cancer differentiation and promoting thyroid cancer progression via targeting IKKalpha signaling. CRSP8 was highly expressed in human thyroid cancer cells and tissues, especially in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Knockdown of CRSP8 suppressed cell growth, migration, invasion, stemness, and induced apoptosis and differentiation in ATC cells, while its overexpression displayed opposite effects in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) cells. Mechanistically, CRSP8 downregulated IKKalpha expression by binding to the IKKalpha promoter region (-257 to -143) to negatively regulate its transcription. Knockdown or overexpression of IKKalpha significantly reversed the expression changes of the differentiation and EMT-related markers and cell growth changes mediated by CRSP8 knockdown or overexpression in ATC or DTC cells. The in vivo study also validated that CRSP8 knockdown inhibited the growth of thyroid cancer by upregulating IKKalpha signaling in a mouse model of human ATC. Furthermore, we found that CRSP8 regulated the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, including cisplatin and epirubicin. Collectively, our results demonstrated that CRSP8 functioned as a modulator of IKKalpha signaling and a suppressor of thyroid cancer differentiation, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for ATC by targeting CRSP8/IKKalpha pathway.

33139930	In addition to the role of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in facilitating tumour cells escape from immune surveillance, it is considered as a crucial effector in transducing intrinsic signals to promote tumour development. Our previous study has pointed out that PD-L1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we first demonstrated that PD-L1 expression levels were positively correlated with p-MerTK levels in patient samples and NSCLC cell lines. In addition, PD-L1 knockdown led to the reduced phosphorylation level of MerTK in vitro. We next showed that PD-L1 regulated NSCLC cell proliferation via Gas6/MerTK signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we unexpectedly found that PD-L1 translocated into the nucleus of cancer cells which was facilitated through the binding of Karyopherin beta1 (KPNB1). Nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1), coupled with transcription factor Sp1, regulated the synthesis of Gas6 mRNA and promoted Gas6 secretion to activate MerTK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results shed light on the novel role of nPD-L1 in NSCLC cell proliferation and reveal a new molecular mechanism underlying nPD-L1-mediated Gas6/MerTK signaling activation. All above findings provide the possible combinational implications for PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy in the clinic.

33116296	Inactivation of tumor suppressor Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) plays an important role during early tumorigenesis. However, posttranslational modifications (PTM)-based mechanism for the inactivation of RUNX3 under hypoxia is still not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism that G9a, lysine-specific methyltransferase (KMT), modulates RUNX3 through PTM under hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly increased G9a protein level and G9a interacted with RUNX3 Runt domain, which led to increased methylation of RUNX3 at K129 and K171. This methylation inactivated transactivation activity of RUNX3 by reducing interactions with CBFbeta and p300 cofactors, as well as reducing acetylation of RUNX3 by p300, which is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport by importin-alpha1. G9a-mediated methylation of RUNX3 under hypoxia promotes cancer cell proliferation by increasing cell cycle or cell division, while suppresses immune response and apoptosis, thereby promoting tumor growth during early tumorigenesis. Our results demonstrate the molecular mechanism of RUNX3 inactivation by G9a-mediated methylation for cell proliferation and antiapoptosis under hypoxia, which can be a therapeutic or preventive target to control tumor growth during early tumorigenesis.	RUNX3 methylation drives hypoxia-induced cell proliferation and antiapoptosis in early tumorigenesis.	Cell death and differentiation
33168956	T-LAK-originated protein kinase (TOPK) overexpression is a feature of multiple cancers, yet is absent from most phenotypically normal tissues. As such, TOPK expression profiling and the development of TOPK-targeting pharmaceutical agents have raised hopes for its future potential in the development of targeted therapeutics. Results presented in this paper confirm the value of TOPK as a potential target for the treatment of solid tumours, and demonstrate the efficacy of a TOPK inhibitor (OTS964) when used in combination with radiation treatment. Using H460 and Calu-6 lung cancer xenograft models, we show that pharmaceutical inhibition of TOPK potentiates the efficacy of fractionated irradiation. Furthermore, we provide in vitro evidence that TOPK plays a hitherto unknown role during S phase, showing that TOPK depletion increases fork stalling and collapse under conditions of replication stress and exogenous DNA damage. Transient knockdown of TOPK was shown to impair recovery from fork stalling and to increase the formation of replication-associated single-stranded DNA foci in H460 lung cancer cells. We also show that TOPK interacts directly with CHK1 and Cdc25c, two key players in the checkpoint signalling pathway activated after replication fork collapse. This study thus provides novel insights into the mechanism by which TOPK activity supports the survival of cancer cells, facilitating checkpoint signalling in response to replication stress and DNA damage.

33268814	To survive proteotoxic stress, cancer cells activate the proteotoxic-stress response pathway, which is controlled by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). This pathway supports cancer initiation, cancer progression and chemoresistance and thus is an attractive therapeutic target. As developing inhibitors against transcriptional regulators, such as HSF1 is challenging, the identification and targeting of upstream regulators of HSF1 present a tractable alternative strategy. Here we demonstrate that in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, the dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) phosphorylates HSF1, promoting its nuclear stability and transcriptional activity. DYRK2 depletion reduces HSF1 activity and sensitises TNBC cells to proteotoxic stress. Importantly, in tumours from TNBC patients, DYRK2 levels positively correlate with active HSF1 and associates with poor prognosis, suggesting that DYRK2 could be promoting TNBC. These findings identify DYRK2 as a key modulator of the HSF1 transcriptional programme and a potential therapeutic target.

33219327	Spermatogenesis is an important cellular differentiation process that produces the male gametes and remains active throughout the individual's lifespan. Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCO) refers to the dysfunction of the male reproductive system, including infertility. Accurate self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is essential to prevent SCO syndrome. This study investigated the role of microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family member 4 (MAST4) in spermatogenesis in mice. MAST4 was localized in Sertoli cells before puberty, providing a somatic niche for spermatogenesis in mice and MAST4 expression shifted to Leydig cells and spermatids throughout puberty. Mast4 knockout (KO) testes were reduced in size compared to wild-type testes, and germ cell depletion associated with an increase in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubular structure were similar to the SCO phenotype. In addition, MAST4 phosphorylated the Ets-related molecule (ERM), specifically the serine 367 residue. The phosphorylation of ERM ultimately controls the transcription of ERM target genes related to SSC self-renewal. The expression of spermatogenesis-associated proteins was significantly decreased whereas Sertoli cell markers were increased in Mast4 KO testes, which was well-founded by RNA-sequencing analysis. Therefore, MAST4 is associated with the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/ERM pathway and this association helps us explore the capacity of SSCs to maintain a vertebrate stem cell niche.

33495554	In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the lymph node (LN) microenvironment delivers critical survival signals by inducing the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members Bcl-XL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis blockade. We determined previously that resistance against various drugs, among which is the clinically applied BH3 mimetic venetoclax, is dominated by upregulation of the anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl-XL. Direct clinical targeting of Bcl-XL by, e.g., Navitoclax is however not desirable due to induction of thrombocytopenia. Since the actual regulation of Bcl-XL in CLL in the context of the LN microenvironment is not well elucidated, we investigated various candidate LN signals to drive Bcl-XL expression. We found a dominance for NF-kappaB signaling upon CD40 stimulation, which results in activation of both the canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We demonstrate that expression of Bcl-XL is first induced by the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, and subsequently boosted and continued via non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling through stabilization of NIK. NF-kappaB subunits p65 and p52 can both bind to the Bcl-XL promoter and activate transcription upon CD40 stimulation. Moreover, canonical NF-kappaB signaling was correlated with Bfl-1 expression, whereas Mcl-1 in contrast, was not transcriptionally regulated by NF-kappaB. Finally, we applied a novel compound targeting NIK to selectively inhibit the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway and showed that venetoclax-resistant CLL cells were sensitized to venetoclax. In conclusion, protective signals from the CLL microenvironment can be tipped towards apoptosis sensitivity by interfering with non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling.

33230261	Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) is an important driver of the cell mitotic spindle required for chromosome segregation and progression into anaphase. SPAG5 has been identified as an important proliferation marker and chemotherapy-sensitivity predictor, especially in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer subtypes. Here, we report that SPAG5 is a direct target of miR-10b-3p, and its aberrantly high expression associates with poor disease-free survival in two large cohorts of breast cancer patients. SPAG5 depletion strongly impaired cancer cell cycle progression, proliferation, and migration. Interestingly, high expression of SPAG5 pairs with a YAP/TAZ-activated signature in breast cancer patients. Reassuringly, the depletion of YAP, TAZ, and TEAD strongly reduced SPAG5 expression and diminished its oncogenic effects. YAP, TAZ coactivators, and TEAD transcription factors are key components of the Hippo signaling pathway involved in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Furthermore, we report that SPAG5 is a direct transcriptional target of TEAD/YAP/TAZ, and pharmacological targeting of YAP and TAZ severely reduces SPAG5 expression. Collectively, our data uncover an oncogenic feedback loop, comprising miR-10b-3p, SPAG5, and YAP/TAZ/TEAD, which fuels the aberrant proliferation of breast cancer.	Aberrant transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of SPAG5, a YAP-TAZ-TEAD downstream effector, fuels breast cancer cell proliferation.	Cell death and differentiation

33273695	The receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key mediator of regulated cell death and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent organ damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug primidone (Liskantin(R)) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in a murine model of TNFalpha-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state of cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1 activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a strong rationale for evaluating the drug primidone in conditions of hyperinflammation in humans.	Primidone blocks RIPK1-driven cell death and inflammation.

33328570	Upregulation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) helps tumor cells escape from immune surveillance, and therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have shown better patient outcomes only in several types of malignancies. Recent studies suggest that the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments is associated with PD-L1 levels; however, the underlying mechanism of high PD-L1 protein levels in cancers is not well defined. Here, we report that the deubiquitinase OTUB1 positively regulates PD-L1 stability and mediates cancer immune responses through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that OTUB1 interacts with and removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from the PD-L1 intracellular domain in a manner dependent on its deubiquitinase activity to hinder the degradation of PD-L1 through the ERAD pathway. Functionally, depletion of OTUB1 markedly decreases PD-L1 abundance, reduces PD-1 protein binding to the tumor cell surface, and causes increased tumor cell sensitivity to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)-mediated cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, OTUB1 ablation-induced PD-L1 destabilization facilitates more CD8(+) T cells infiltration and increases the level of IFN-gamma in serum to enhance antitumor immunity in mice, and the tumor growth suppression by OTUB1 silencing could be reversed by PD-L1 overexpression. Furthermore, we observe a significant correlation between PD-L1 abundance and OTUB1 expression in human breast carcinoma. Our study reveals OTUB1 as a deubiquitinating enzyme that influences cancer immunosuppression via regulation of PD-L1 stability and may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.

33328571	Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase harboring multiple cellular functions. We found that the TRIM28 protein is frequently overexpressed in patients with lung cancer. The stable overexpression of TRIM28 in lung cancer cells and xenograft models significantly increased the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, whereas knockdown of TRIM28 had the opposite effect. We further observed that TRIM28 regulates the ubiquitin ligases RLIM and MDM2 to target the p53 levels during lung tumorigenesis. These data provide new insights into lung cancer development and potential new therapeutic targets for this disease.	Sequential ubiquitination of p53 by TRIM28, RLIM, and MDM2 in lung tumorigenesis.

33462413	Caspase-8-cleaved Bid (cBid) associates with mitochondria and promotes the activation of BAX, leading to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. However, current structural models of cBid are largely based on studies using membrane vesicles and detergent micelles. Here we employ spin-label ESR and site-directed PEGylation methods to identify conformations of cBid at real mitochondrial membranes, revealing stepwise mechanisms in the activation process. Upon the binding of cBid to mitochondria, its structure is reorganized to expose the BH3 domain while leaving the structural integrity only slightly altered. The mitochondria-bound cBid is in association with Mtch2 and it remains in the primed state until interacting with BAX. The interaction subsequently triggers the fragmentation of cBid, causes large conformational changes, and promotes BAX-mediated MOMP. Our results reveal structural differences of cBid between mitochondria and other lipid-like environments and, moreover, highlight the role of the membrane binding in modifying cBid structure and assisting the inactive-to-active transition in function.

33469231	Site-1 protease (S1P) is a Golgi-located protein that activates unique membrane-bound latent transcription factors, and it plays an indispensable role in endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response and lysosome function. A patient with S1P mutation exhibits severe skeletal dysplasia with kyphoscoliosis, dysmorphic facial features and pectus carinatum. However, whether S1P regulates bone remodeling by affecting osteoclastogenesis remains elusive. Here, we show that S1P is indeed a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis. S1P ablation in mice led to significant osteosclerosis compared with wild-type littermates. Mechanistically, S1P showed upregulated during osteoclastogenesis and was identified as a direct target of miR-9-5p. S1P deletion in bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) inhibited ATF6 and SREBP2 maturation, which subsequently impeded CHOP/SREBP2-complex-induced LC3 expression and autophagy flux. Consistently, transfection of LC3 adenovirus evidently rescued osteoclastogenesis in S1P-deficient BMMs. We then identified the interaction regions between CHOP and SREBP2 by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and molecular docking. Furthermore, S1P deletion or inhibitor efficaciously rescued ovariectomized (OVX)- and LPS-induced bone loss in vivo. Collectively, we showed that S1P regulates osteoclast differentiation in a LC3 dependent manner and so is a potential therapy target for osteoporosis.

33469229	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies and cause of death from cancer in China. Previous studies showed that autophagy and apoptosis inhibition are critical for the survival of ESCC cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. Recently, we found that PIWIL2, a novel cancer testis protein, is highly expressed in ESCC and associated with high T-stage and poor 5-year survival rate in patients. Our further study showed that PIWIL2 can directly bind to IKK and promote its phosphorylation, leading to phosphorylation of IkappaB and subsequently nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB for apoptosis inhibition. Meanwhile, PIWIL2 competitively inhibits binding of IKK to TSC1, and thus deactivate mTORC1 pathway which suppresses ULK1 phosphorylation and initiation of autophagy. The mouse xenograft model suggested that PIWIL2 can promote ESCC growth in an IKK-dependent manner. This present work firstly revealed that PIWIL2 can play a role in regulating autophagy and apoptosis, and is associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients, providing novel insights into the roles of PIWIL2 in tumorigenesis.

33504946	Protein Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (Prame), a tumor-associated antigen, has been found to frequently overexpress in various cancers, which indicates advanced cancer stages and poor clinical prognosis. Moreover, previous reports noted that Prame functions as a substrate recognizing receptor protein of Cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs) to mediate potential substrates degradation through Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). However, none of the Prame specific substrate has been identified so far. In this study, proteomic analysis of RBX1-interacting proteins revealed p14/ARF, a well-known tumor suppressor, as a novel ubiquitin target of RBX1. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation and in vivo ubiquitination assay determined Cullin2-RBX1-Transcription Elongation Factor B Subunit 2 (EloB) assembled CRL2 E3 ligase complex to regulate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p14/ARF. Finally, through siRNA screening, Prame was identified as the specific receptor protein responsible for recognizing p14/ARF to be degraded. Additionally, via bioinformatics analysis of TCGA database and clinical samples, Prame was determined to overexpress in tumor tissues vs. paired adjacent tissues and associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. As such, downregulation of Prame expression significantly restrained cancer cell growth by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, which could be rescued by simultaneously knocking down of p14/ARF. Altogether, targeting overexpressed Prame in cancer cells inactivated RBX1-Cullin2-EloB-Prame E3 ligase (CRL2(Prame)) and halted p14/ARF degradation to restrain tumor growth by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest.

33637972	Hedgehog signaling plays a pivotal role in embryonic pattern formation and diverse aspects of the postnatal biological process. Perturbation of the hedgehog pathway and overexpression of GLI1, a downstream transcription factor in the hedgehog pathway, are highly relevant to several malignancies including chondrosarcoma (CS). We previously found that knocking down expression of GLI1 attenuates the disrupted Indian hedgehog (IHH) signal pathway and suppresses cell survival in human CS cells. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the expression of GLI1 are still unknown. Here, we demonstrated the implication of GLI1 in SMO-independent pathways in CS cells. A GLI1 binding protein, major vault protein (MVP), was identified using the affinity purification method. MVP promoted the nuclear transport and stabilization of GLI1 by compromising the binding affinity of GLI1 with suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) and increased GLI1 expression via mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascade. Functionally, knockdown of MVP suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis. Simultaneous inhibition of MVP and GLI1 strongly inhibits the growth of CS in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, IHC results showed that MVP, GLI1, and P-p70S6K1 were highly expressed and positively correlated with each other in 71 human CS tissues. Overall, our findings revealed a novel regulating mechanism for HH-independent GLI1 expression and provide a rationale for combination therapy in patients with advanced CS.

33568778	The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates many distinct biological processes. Its dysregulation causes various diseases, including but not limited to cancer. In this study, based on the analysis of gene expression in several colorectal cancer (CRC) datasets, we show that FBXL6, a poorly-characterized F-box protein, is amplified, over-expressed, and highly correlated with poor prognosis in human CRC patients. Mechanistically, FBXL6 targets phospho-p53 (S315) to mediate its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting p53 signaling. FBXL6 depletion inhibits proliferation of p53 wild-type (WT) CRC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 transcriptionally suppresses FBXL6 expression by binding its core promoter region. Taken together, these results identify the feed-forward loop of FBXL6-p53 as a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatments.	FBXL6 degrades phosphorylated p53 to promote tumor growth.

33558705	Radioresistance is regarded as the main barrier to effective radiotherapy in lung cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of radioresistance remain elusive. Here, we show that lysine-specific demethylase 4C (KDM4C) is overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. We provide evidence that genetical or pharmacological inhibition of KDM4C impairs tumorigenesis and radioresistance in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we uncover that KDM4C upregulates TGF-beta2 expression by directly reducing H3K9me3 level at the TGF-beta2 promoter and then activates Smad/ATM/Chk2 signaling to confer radioresistance in lung cancer. Using tandem affinity purification technology, we further identify deubiquitinase USP9X as a critical binding partner that deubiquitinates and stabilizes KDM4C. More importantly, depletion of USP9X impairs TGF-beta2/Smad signaling and radioresistance by destabilizing KDM4C in lung cancer cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that USP9X-mediated KDM4C deubiquitination activates TGF-beta2/Smad signaling to promote radioresistance, suggesting that targeting KDM4C may be a promising radiosensitization strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.	USP9X-mediated KDM4C deubiquitination promotes lung cancer radioresistance by epigenetically inducing TGF-beta2 transcription.	Cell death and differentiation
33649471	Emerging evidence suggests that USP39 plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism by which USP39 promotes HCC progression has not been well defined, especially regarding its putative ubiquitination function. Zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is a crucial inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis, but the regulatory mechanism of ZEB1 stability in HCC remains enigmatic. Here, we reveal that USP39 is highly expressed in human HCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, USP39 depletion inhibits HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by promoting ZEB1 degradation. Intriguingly, deubiquitinase USP39 has a direct interaction with the E3 ligase TRIM26 identified by co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence staining assays. We further demonstrate that TRIM26 is lowly expressed in human HCC tissues and inhibits HCC cell proliferation and migration. TRIM26 promotes the degradation of ZEB1 protein by ubiquitination in HCC. Deubiquitinase USP39 and E3 ligase TRIM26 function in an antagonistic pattern, but not a competitive pattern, and play key roles in controlling ZEB1 stability to determine the HCC progression. In summary, our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism that USP39 and TRIM26 balance the level of ZEB1 ubiquitination and thereby determine HCC cell proliferation and migration. This novel mechanism may provide new approaches to target treatment for inhibiting HCC development by restoring TRIM26 or suppressing USP39 expression in HCC cases with high ZEB1 protein levels.

33742136	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD50A and SNORD50B (SNORD50A/B) has been reported to be recurrently deleted and function as a putative tumor suppressor in different types of cancer by binding to and suppressing the activity of the KRAS oncoproteins. Its deletion correlates with poorer patient survival. However, in this study, we surprisingly found that SNORD50A/B loss predicted a better survival in breast cancer patients carrying wild-type p53. Functional studies showed that SNORD50A/B deletion strongly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic potential, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53 wild-type breast cancer cells, while exerted the opposite effects in p53 mutated breast cancer cells. This was also supported by ectopically expressing SNORD50A/B in both p53 wild-type and mutated breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, SNORD50A/B clearly enhances the interaction between E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 and its substrate GMPS by forming a complex among them, thereby promoting GMPS ubiquitination and its subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration. SNORD50A/B deletion in p53 wild-type breast cancer cells will release GMPS and induce the translocation of GMPS into the nucleus, where GMPS can recruit USP7 and form a complex with p53, thereby decreasing p53 ubiquitination, stabilizing p53 proteins, and inhibiting malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Altogether, the present study first reports that SNORD50A/B plays an oncogenic role in p53 wild-type breast cancers by mediating TRIM21-GMPS interaction.	The noncoding RNAs SNORD50A and SNORD50B-mediated TRIM21-GMPS interaction promotes the growth of p53 wild-type breast cancers by degrading p53.	Cell death and differentiation

33762743	The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, and there is no disease-modifying agent for PD. Withaferin A (WA), a naturally occurring compound, has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the mechanisms by which WA is neuroprotective in PD are unknown. Here we show that WA protected against loss of dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits in MPTP-induced PD mouse models. Whole-genome deep sequencing analysis combined with Meta-analysis of human PD studies reveal that DJ1, Nrf2, and STING in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are linked to anti-PD effect of WA. We found that WA activated DJ1 and Nrf2, and suppressed STING within SNc; and overexpression of STING in SNc dampened the effect of WA. Using genetically modified mice (DJ1-KO, Nrf2-KO, STING(gt/gt) and STING-KO) and immunolabeling technique, we identified that WA targeted DJ1-Nrf2-STING pathway in dopaminergic neurons; and we demonstrate that STING might be an important factor in PD pathogenesis. In addition, WA alleviated accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-syn) and insoluble alpha-syn within SNc in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated human alpha-syn overexpression PD model. Our comparative analysis on whole-genome transcriptome profiles suggests that STING might be a key target of WA and amantadine in PD treatment. This study highlights a multifaceted role for WA in neuroprotection, and suggests that WA can be a potential candidate for treatment of PD.

33712741	Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a main cause of mortality and severe neurologic impairment in the perinatal and neonatal period. However, few satisfactory therapeutic strategies are available. Here, we reported that a rapid nuclear translocation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN) is an essential step in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD)- and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injures both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found that OGD-induced nuclear translocation of PTEN is dependent on PTEN mono-ubiquitination at the lysine 13 residue (K13) that is mediated by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Importantly, we for the first time identified alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein (Aagab) as a novel NEDD4-1 regulator to regulate the level of NEDD4-1, subsequently mediating Pten nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrated that genetic upregulation of Aagab or application of Tat-K13 peptide (a short interference peptide that flanks K13 residue of PTEN) not only reduced Pten nuclear translocation, but also significantly alleviated the deficits of myodynamia, motor and spatial learning and memory in HIBD model rats. These results suggest that Aagab may serve as a regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten nuclear translocation to promote functional recovery following HIBD in neonatal rats, and provide a new potential therapeutic target to guide the clinical treatment for HIE.

33846536	Drug resistance has remained an important issue in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, including cancer. Herein, we found that USP24 not only repressed DNA-damage repair (DDR) activity by decreasing Rad51 expression to cause the tumor genomic instability and cancer stemness, but also increased the levels of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-gp, ABCG2, and ezrin to enhance the pumping out of Taxol from cancer cells, thus resulted in drug resistance during cancer therapy. A novel USP24 inhibitor, NCI677397, was screened for specific inhibiting the catalytic activity of USP24. This inhibitor was identified to suppress drug resistance via decreasing genomic instability, cancer stemness, and the pumping out of drugs from cancer cells. Understanding the role and molecular mechanisms of USP24 in drug resistance will be beneficial for the future development of a novel USP24 inhibitor. Our studies provide a new insight of USP24 inhibitor for clinically implication of blocking drug resistance during chemotherapy.	USP24 promotes drug resistance during cancer therapy.

33753902	Hevin, also known as SPARC-like protein 1 (SPARCL1 or SC1), is a synaptogenic protein secreted by astrocytes and modulates the formation of glutamatergic synapses in the developing brain by interacting with synaptic adhesion proteins, such as neurexin and neuroligin. Here, we identified the neuron-specific vesicular protein calcyon as a novel interaction partner of hevin and demonstrated that this interaction played a pivotal role in synaptic reorganization after an injury in the mature brain. Astrocytic hevin was upregulated post-injury in a photothrombotic stroke model. Hevin was fragmented by MMP3 induced during the acute stage of brain injury, and this process was associated with severe gliosis. At the late stage, the functional hevin level was restored as MMP3 expression decreased. The C-terminus of hevin interacted with the N-terminus of calcyon. By using RNAi and binding competitor peptides in an ischemic brain injury model, we showed that this interaction was crucial in synaptic and functional recoveries in the sensory-motor cortex, based on histological and electrophysiological analyses. Regulated expression of hevin and calcyon and interaction between them were confirmed in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury and patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Our study provides direct evidence for the causal relationship between the hevin-calcyon interaction and synaptic reorganization after brain injury. This neuron-glia interaction can be exploited to modulate synaptic reorganization under various neurological conditions.	Hevin-calcyon interaction promotes synaptic reorganization after brain injury.

33963314	The prerequisite function of vimentin for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is not clearly elucidated yet. Here, we show that vimentin phosphorylated by PLK1, triggers TGF-beta-signaling, which consequently leads to metastasis and PD-L1 expression for immune suppression in lung adenocarcinoma. The clinical correlation between expression of both vimentin and PLK1, and overall survival rates of patients was significant in lung adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma. The phosphorylation of vimentin was accompanied by the activation of PLK1 during TGF-beta-induced EMT in lung adenocarcinoma. Among the several phosphorylation sites determined by phospho-proteomic analysis and the site-specific mutagenesis, the phosphorylation at S339 displayed the most effective metastasis and tumourigenesis with the highest expression of PD-L1, compared with that of wild-type and other versions in both 3D cell culture and tail-vein injection metastasis models. Phosphomimetic vimentin at S339 interacted with p-Smad2 for its nuclear localization, leading to the expression of PD-L1. Clinical relevance revealed the inverse correlation between the survival rates of patients and the expressions of VIM, PLK1, and CD274 in primary and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin activates TGF-beta signaling pathway, leading to the metastasis and immune escape through the expression of PD-L1, functioning as a shuttling protein in lung adenocarcinoma.	PLK1/vimentin signaling facilitates immune escape by recruiting Smad2/3 to PD-L1 promoter in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.	Cell death and differentiation
33953349	The biological function of PRMT5 remains poorly understood in cervical cancer metastasis. Here, we report that PRMT5 physically associates with the transcription factor Snail and the NuRD(MTA1) complex to form a transcriptional-repressive complex that catalyzes the symmetrical histone dimethylation and deacetylation. This study shows that the Snail/PRMT5/NuRD(MTA1) complex targets genes, such as TET1 and E-cadherin, which are critical for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This complex also affects the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. This study demonstrates that the Snail/PRMT5/NuRD(MTA1) complex promotes the invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. This study also shows that PRMT5 expression is upregulated in cervical cancer and various human cancers, and the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 suppresses EMT and the invasion potential of cervical cancer cells by disinhibiting the expression of TET1 and increasing 5hmC, suggesting that PRMT5 is a potential target for cancer therapy.

33986463	Here, we provide evidence that high ATP production by the mitochondrial ATP-synthase is a new therapeutic target for anticancer therapy, especially for preventing tumor progression. More specifically, we isolated a subpopulation of ATP-high cancer cells which are phenotypically aggressive and demonstrate increases in proliferation, stemness, anchorage-independence, cell migration, invasion and multi-drug resistance, as well as high antioxidant capacity. Clinically, these findings have important implications for understanding treatment failure and cancer cell dormancy. Using bioinformatic analysis of patient samples, we defined a mitochondrial-related gene signature for metastasis, which features the gamma-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase (ATP5F1C). The relationship between ATP5F1C protein expression and metastasis was indeed confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Next, we used MDA-MB-231 cells as a model system to functionally validate these findings. Importantly, ATP-high MDA-MB-231 cells showed a nearly fivefold increase in metastatic capacity in vivo. Consistent with these observations, ATP-high cells overexpressed (i) components of mitochondrial complexes I-V, including ATP5F1C, and (ii) markers associated with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastasis, such as EpCAM and VCAM1. Knockdown of ATP5F1C expression significantly reduced ATP-production, anchorage-independent growth, and cell migration, as predicted. Similarly, therapeutic administration of the FDA-approved drug, Bedaquiline, downregulated ATP5F1C expression in vitro and prevented spontaneous metastasis in vivo. In contrast, Bedaquiline had no effect on the growth of non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) or primary tumors in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that mitochondrial ATP depletion is a new therapeutic strategy for metastasis prophylaxis, to avoid treatment failure. In summary, we conclude that mitochondrial ATP5F1C is a promising new biomarker and molecular target for future drug development, for the prevention of metastatic disease progression.	Bedaquiline, an FDA-approved drug, inhibits mitochondrial ATP production and metastasis in vivo, by targeting the gamma subunit (ATP5F1C) of the ATP synthase.	Cell death and differentiation
33875796	The aberrant classical miRNAs are considered to play significant roles in tumor progression. However, it remains unclear for nonclassical miRNAs, a set of Drosha-independent miRNAs in the process of various biology. Here, we reveal that a nonclassical miR-4646-5p plays a pivotal role in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. MiR-4646-5p, one of Drosha-independent mirtronic miRNA, is aberrant up-regulated in Drosha-low expressed GC and Drosha-knockdown gastric cancer cells. Mirtronic miR-4646-5p is a specific transcription splicing product of intron 3 of the host gene Abhd16a with the aid of SRSF2. The enhanced miR-4646-5p can stabilize HIF1A by targeting PHD3 to positive feedback regulate Abhd16a and miR-4646-5p itself expressions. ABHD16A, as an emerging phosphatidylserine-specific lipase, involves in lipid metabolism leading to lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PSs) accumulation, which stimulates RhoA and downstream LIMK/cofilin cascade activity through GPR34/Gi subunit, thus causes metastasis of gastric cancer. In addition, miR-4646-5p/PHD3/HIF1A signaling can also up-regulate RhoA expression and synergistically promote gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our study provides new insights of nonclassical mirtronic miRNA on tumor progress and may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker for gastric cancer. MiR-4646-5p and its host gene Abhd16a mediated abnormal lipid metabolism may be a new target for clinical treatment of gastric cancer.

33753903	"Wnt signaling is mainly transduced by beta-catenin via regulation of the beta-catenin destruction complex containing Axin, APC, and GSK3beta. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a well-known master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis processes. TFEB's nuclear localization and transcriptional activity are also regulated by various upstream signals. In this study, we found that Wnt signaling induces the nuclear localization of TFEB and the expression of Wnt target genes is regulated by TFEB-beta-catenin-TCF/LEF1 as well as beta-catenin-TCF/LEF1 complexes. Our biochemical data revealed that TFEB is a part of the beta-catenin destruction complex, and destabilization of the destruction complex by knockdown of either Axin or APC causes nuclear localization of TFEB. Interestingly, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that about 27% of Wnt3a-induced genes were TFEB dependent. However, these ""TFEB mediated Wnt target genes"" were different from TFEB target genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis processes. Mechanistically, we found that Tankyrase (TNKS) PARsylates TFEB with Wnt ON signaling, and the nuclear localized PARsylated TFEB forms a complex with beta-catenin-TCF/LEF1 to induce the ""TFEB mediated Wnt target genes"". Finally, we found that in various types of cancer, the levels of TFEB mediated Wnt target genes exhibit strong correlations with the level of Axin2, which represents the activity of Wnt signaling. Overall, our data suggest that Wnt signaling induces the expression of a subset of genes that are distinct from previously known genes regulated by the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF1 complex or TFEB, by forming a transcription factor complex consisting of PARsylated TFEB and beta-catenin-TCF/LEF1."

33941870	Deubiquitinases (DUBs) regulate diverse biological processes and represent a novel class of drug targets. However, the biological function of only a small fraction of DUBs, especially in adaptive immune response regulation, is well-defined. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 12 (USP12) as a critical regulator of CD4(+) T cell activation. USP12 plays an intrinsic role in promoting the CD4(+) T cell phenotype, including differentiation, activation, and proliferation. Although USP12-deficient CD4(+) T cells protected mice from autoimmune diseases, the immune response against bacterial infection was subdued. USP12 stabilized B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) by deubiquitinating, and thereby activated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Interestingly, this USP12 regulatory mechanism was identified in CD4(+) T cells, but not in CD8(+) T cells. Our study results showed that USP12 activated CD4(+) T cell signaling, and targeting USP12 might help develop therapeutic interventions for treating inflammatory diseases or pathogen infections.	USP12 promotes CD4(+) T cell responses through deubiquitinating and stabilizing BCL10.	Cell death and differentiation
33947971	Sorting nexins (SNXs), the retromer-associated cargo binding proteins, have emerged as critical regulators of the trafficking of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases. However, studies of SNXs in the development of cardiovascular diseases, especially cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, are lacking. Here, we ask whether SNX3, the simplest structured isoform in the SNXs family, may act as a key inducer of myocardial injury. An increased level of SNX3 was observed in failing hearts from human patients and mice. Cardiac-specific Snx3 knockout (Snx3-cKO) mice and Snx3 transgenic (Snx3-cTg) mice were generated to evaluate the role of Snx3 in myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart function by morphology, echocardiography, histological staining, and hypertrophic biomarkers. We report that Snx3-cKO in mice significantly protected against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy at 12 weeks. Conversely, Snx3-cTg mice were more susceptible to ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy at 12 weeks and showed aggravated cardiac injury even heart failure at 24 weeks. Immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry, immunofluorescent staining, co-immunoprecipitation, localized surface plasmon resonance, and proximity ligation assay were performed to examine the direct interaction of SNX3-retromer with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We discovered that STAT3 was a new interacting partner of SNX3-retromer, and SNX3-retromer served as an essential platform for assembling gp130/JAK2/STAT3 complexes and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 by direct combination at EE. SNX3-retromer and STAT3 complexes were transiently imported into the nucleus after hypertrophic stimuli. The pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of STAT3 reversed SNX3 overexpression-induced myocardial injury. STAT3 overexpression blunts the beneficial function of SNX3 knockdown on hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. We show that SNX3-retromer promoted importin alpha3-mediated STAT3 nuclear trafficking and ultimately leading to cardiac injury. Taken together, our study reveals that SNX3 plays a key role in cardiac function and implicates SNX3 as a potential therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

33953350	Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3 or RIPK3), the critical executor of cell programmed necrosis, plays essential roles in maintaining immune responses and appropriate tissue homeostasis. Although the E3 ligases CHIP and PELI1 are reported to promote RIP3 degradation, however, how post-translational modification regulates RIP3 activity and stability is poorly understood. Here, we identify the tripartite motif protein TRIM25 as a negative regulator of RIP3-dependent necrosis. TRIM25 directly interacts with RIP3 through its SPRY domain and mediates the K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP3 on residue K501. The RING domain of TRIM25 facilitates the polyubiquitination chain on RIP3, thereby promoting proteasomal degradation of RIP3. Also, TRIM25 deficiency inhibited the ubiquitination of RIP3, thus promoting TNF-induced cell necrosis. Our current finding reveals the regulating mechanism of polyubiquitination on RIP3, which might be a potential therapeutic target for the intervention of RIP3-dependent necrosis-related diseases.

33972717	Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is an oncogenic factor that is highly expressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and promotes cell proliferation, survival, migration, stemness, and tumor growth; however, its posttranslational modifications are poorly defined. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is also an oncogene implicated in various carcinomas, including breast cancer. In this study, we found that PRMT5 interacts with KLF5 and catalyzes the di-methylation of KLF5 at Arginine 57 (R57) in a methyltransferase activity-dependent manner in BLBC cells. Depletion or pharmaceutical inhibition (using PJ-68) of PRMT5 decreased the expression of KLF5 and its downstream target genes in vitro and in vivo. PRMT5-induced KLF5R57me2 antagonizes GSK3beta-mediated KLF5 phosphorylation and subsequently Fbw7-mediated KLF5 ubiquitination and coupled degradation. Functionally, PRMT5 promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance and proliferation, at least partially, by stabilizing KLF5. PRMT5 and KLF5 protein levels were positively correlated in clinical BLBCs. Taken together, PRMT5 methylates KLF5 to prevent its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, and thus promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance and proliferation. These findings suggest that PRMT5 is a potential therapeutic target for BLBC.

32161311	"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common and lethal human urological malignancies in the world. One of the pathological drivers for ccRCC is the Ras family of small GTPases that function as ""molecular switches"" in many diseases including ccRCC. Among the GTPases in the Di-Ras family, DIRAS2 gene encodes a GTPase that shares 60% homology to Ras and Rap. Yet little is known about the biological function(s) of Di-Ras2 or how its activities are regulated. In this study, we focused on Di-Ras2, and determined its functions and underlying mechanism during formation of ccRCC. We found that Di-Ras2 was upregulated in ccRCC, and promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of human ccRCC cells in the absence of von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Mechanistically, Di-Ras2 induces and regulates ccRCC formation by modulating phosphorylation of the downstream effectors and activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Moreover, Di-Ras2 interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase, pVHL, which facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of Di-Ras2. Together, these results indicate a potential function of Di-Ras2 as an oncogene in ccRCC, and these data provide a new perspective of the relationship between pVHL and the MAPK pathway in ccRCC tumorigenesis."

32203161	Fusion genes resulting from chromosomal rearrangements are frequently found in a variety of cancer cells. Some of these are known to be driver oncogenes, such as BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The products of such fusion genes are abnormal proteins that are ordinarily degraded in cells by a mechanism known as protein quality control. This suggests that the degradation of BCR-ABL protein is suppressed in CML cells to ensure their proliferative activity. Here, we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) suppresses the degradation of BCR-ABL protein in cells harboring Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). USP25 was found proximal to BCR-ABL protein in cells. Depletion of USP25 using shRNA-mediated gene silencing increased the ubiquitylated BCR-ABL, and reduced the level of BCR-ABL protein. Accordingly, BCR-ABL-mediated signaling and cell proliferation were suppressed in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia cells by the depletion of USP25. We further found that pharmacological inhibition of USP25 induced rapid degradation of BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive leukemia cells, regardless of their sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that USP25 is a novel target for inducing the degradation of oncogenic BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive leukemia cells. This could be an effective approach to overcome resistance to kinase inhibitors.	Deubiquitylase USP25 prevents degradation of BCR-ABL protein and ensures proliferation of Ph-positive leukemia cells.

32203166	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in cancer long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been known to play crucial roles in cancer development and progression by regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression. However, only a few lncRNAs with annotated functions in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been identified to date. In the present study, the expression of lncCMPK2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and positively correlated with clinical stages and lymphatic metastasis. The overexpression of lncCMPK2 promoted the proliferation and cell cycle transition of CRC cells. Conversely, the silencing of lncCMPK2 restricted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. lncCMPK2 was localized to the nucleus of CRC cells, bound to far upstream element binding protein 3 (FUBP3), and guided FUBP3 to the far upstream element (FUSE) of the c-Myc gene to activate transcription. lncCMPK2 also stabilized FUBP3. These results provide novel insights into the functional mechanism of lncCMPK2 in CRC progression and highlight its potential as a biomarker of advanced CRC and therapeutic target.

32205868	Prostate cancer (PCa) innervation contributes to the progression of PCa. However, the precise impact of innervation on PCa cells is still poorly understood. By focusing on muscarinic receptors, which are activated by the nerve-derived neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we show that muscarinic receptors 1 and 3 (m1 and m3) are highly expressed in PCa clinical specimens compared with all other cancer types, and that amplification or gain of their corresponding encoding genes (CHRM1 and CHRM3, respectively) represent a worse prognostic factor for PCa progression free survival. Moreover, m1 and m3 gene gain or amplification is frequent in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) specimens. This was reflected in HSPC-derived cells, which show aberrantly high expression of m1 and m3 under androgen deprivation mimicking castration and androgen receptor inhibition. We also show that pharmacological activation of m1 and m3 signaling is sufficient to induce the castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we found that m1 and m3 stimulation induces YAP activation through FAK, whose encoding gene, PTK2 is frequently amplified in CRPC cases. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK and knockdown of YAP abolished m1 and m3-induced castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Our findings provide novel therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic-signal-driven CRPC progression by targeting the FAK-YAP signaling axis.

32214200	A Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), is known to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancer types; however, whether DLC1 is a tumor-suppressor gene or an oncogene in melanoma remains to be clarified. Here we revealed that high DLC1 expression was detected in most of the melanoma tissues where it was localized in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. Functional studies unveiled that DLC1 was both required and sufficient for melanoma growth and metastasis. These tumorigenic events were mediated by nuclear-localized DLC1 in a RhoGAP-independent manner. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis identified a DLC1-associated protein, FOXK1 transcription factor, which mediated oncogenic events in melanoma by translocating and retaining DLC1 into the nucleus. RNA-sequencing profiling studies further revealed MMP9 as a direct target of FOXK1 through DLC1-regulated promoter occupancy for cooperative activation of MMP9 expression to promote melanoma invasion and metastasis. Concerted action of DLC1-FOXK1 in MMP9 gene regulation was further supported by their highly correlated expression in melanoma patients' samples and cell lines. Together, our results not only unravel a mechanism by which nuclear DLC1 functions as an oncogene in melanoma but also suggest an unexpected role of RhoGAP protein in transcriptional regulation.

32238881	Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), the key enzyme of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, has been reported to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis by upregulating the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. However, the profile of BCKDK in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains unknown. Here, we report a novel role of BCKDK in mCRC. BCKDK is upregulated in CRC tissues. Increased BCKDK expression was associated with metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of BCKDK decreased CRC cell migration and invasion ex vivo, and lung metastasis in vivo. BCKDK promoted the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, by decreasing the expression of E-cadherin, epithelial marker, and increasing the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, which are mesenchymal markers. Moreover, BCKDK-knockdown experiments in combination with phosphoproteomics analysis revealed the potent role of BCKDK in modulating multiple signal transduction pathways, including EMT and metastasis. Src phosphorylated BCKDK at the tyrosine 246 (Y246) site in vitro and ex vivo. Knockdown and knockout of Src downregulated the phosphorylation of BCKDK. Importantly, phosphorylation of BCKDK by Src enhanced the activity and stability of BCKDK, thereby promoting the migration, invasion, and EMT of CRC cells. In summary, the identification of BCKDK as a novel prometastatic factor in human CRC will be beneficial for further diagnostic biomarker studies and suggests novel targeting opportunities.

32277233	Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is caused by solar ultraviolet (SUV) exposure and is the most common cancer in the United States. T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a serine-threonine kinase is activated by SUV irradiation and involved in skin carcinogenesis. Strategies with research focusing on the TOPK signaling pathway and targeted therapy in skin carcinogenesis may helpful for the discovery of additional treatments against skin cancer. In this study, we found that TOPK can directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Jun (as one of the core member of AP-1) at Ser63 and Ser73 after SSL exposure in a JNKs-independent manner. TOPK knocking down, or HI-TOPK-032 (TOPK specific inhibitor) attenuated colony formation and cell proliferation of skin cancer cells. Phosphorylated levels of c-Jun were overexpressed in human AK and cSCC compared with normal skin tissues, and HI-TOPK-032 inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun in SCC cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HI-TOPK-032 decreased SSL-induced AP-1 transactivation activity. Moreover, acute SSL-induced inflammation was attenuated by the topical application of HI-TOPK-032 in SKH1 hairless mice. Importantly, HI-TOPK-032 suppressed chronic SSL-induced skin carcinogenesis and c-Jun phosphorylation levels in SKH1 hairless mice. Our results demonstrate that TOPK can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the process of skin carcinogenesis and HI-TOPK-032 could be used as a potential chemopreventive drug against cSCC development.

32291412	CD147, also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in tumor cells, particularly melanoma cells, and plays critical roles in tumor cell metastasis through the regulation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression. In this study, we identified Fyn as a novel interacting protein of CD147. Fyn is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulates diverse physiological processes, such as T lymphocyte differentiation, through the TCR signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrated that Fyn directly phosphorylates CD147 at Y140 and Y183. Two phosphospecific antibodies against Y140 and Y183 were developed to validate the phosphorylation of CD147 by Fyn. Moreover, the CD147-FF (Y140F/Y183F) mutation impaired the interaction between CD147 and GnT-V, leading to decreased CD147 glycosylation and membrane recruitment. In addition, CD147-FF significantly blocked MMP-9 expression as well as cell migration. Moreover, we found that Fyn is overexpressed in clinical melanoma tissues as well as in melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of Fyn expression markedly attenuated the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo through downregulation of CD147 phosphorylation, indicating that Fyn/CD147 is a potential target molecule in melanoma treatment. Finally, through virtual screening, we identified amodiaquine as a potential inhibitor targeting the Fyn/CD147 axis. Amodiaquine treatment dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of CD147 by Fyn, thus attenuating melanoma cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that amodiaquine is a promising inhibitor for melanoma treatment.	The phosphorylation of CD147 by Fyn plays a critical role for melanoma cells growth and metastasis.	Oncogene
32291413	Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete high levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) that contributes to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TGF-beta1 modulates the expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), but its role in tumour progression still remains controversial. To clarify L1 function in PDAC and cellular phenotypes, we performed L1CAM cell sorting, silencing and overexpression in several primary pancreatic cancer cells. PSCs silenced for TGF-beta1 were used for crosstalk experiments. We found that TGF-beta1 secreted by PSCs negatively regulates L1CAM expression, through canonical TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signalling, leading to a more aggressive PDAC phenotype. Cells with reduced expression of L1CAM harboured enhanced stemness potential and tumourigenicity. Inactivation of TGF-beta1 signalling in PSCs strongly reduced the aggressiveness of PDAC cells. Our data provide functional proof and mechanistic insights for the tumour-suppressive function of L1CAM via reducing stemness. Rescuing L1CAM expression in cancer cells through targeting of TGF-beta1 reverses stemness and bears the potential to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC patients.

32291411	It has been well established that the von Hippel-Lindau/hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (VHL-HIFalpha) axis and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, few studies have addressed the relationship between the two oncogenic drivers in RCC. SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a histone methyltransferase involved in gene transcription and oncogenesis, but its expression and function in RCC remain unclear. In the present study, we found that SMYD3 expression was significantly elevated in RCC tumors and correlated with advanced tumor stage, histological and nuclear grade, and shorter survival. Depletion of SMYD3 inhibited RCC cell proliferation, colony numbers, and xenograft tumor formation, while promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, SMYD3 cooperates with SP1 to transcriptionally promote EGFR expression, amplifying its downstream signaling activity. TCGA data analyses revealed a significantly increased SMYD3 expression in primary RCC tumors carrying the loss-of-function VHL mutations. We further showed that HIF-2alpha can directly bind to the SMYD3 promoter and subsequently induced SMYD3 transcription and expression. Taken together, we identify the VHL/HIF-2alpha/SMYD3 signaling cascade-mediated EGFR hyperactivity through which SMYD3 promotes RCC progression. Our study suggests that SMYD3 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor in RCC.

32313226	Hippo signaling functions to limit cellular growth, but the aberrant nuclear accumulation of its downstream YAP1 leads to carcinogenesis. YAP1/TEAD complex activates the oncogenic downstream transcription, such as CTGF and c-Myc. How YAP1 is protected in the cytoplasm from ubiquitin-mediated degradation remains elusive. In this study, a member of Angiomotin (Motin) family, AMOTL1 (Angiomotin Like 1), was screened out as the only one to promote YAP1 nuclear accumulation by several clinical cohorts, which was further confirmed by the cellular functional assays. The interaction between YAP1 and AMOTL1 was suggested by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. The clinical significance of the AMOTL1-YAP1-CTGF axis in gastric cancer (GC) was analyzed by multiple clinical cohorts. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of targeting the oncogenic axis was appraised by drug-sensitivity tests and xenograft-formation assays. The upregulation of AMOTL1 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of GC, and knocking down AMOTL1 impairs its oncogenic properties. The cytoplasmic interaction between AMOTL1 and YAP1 protects each other from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. AMOTL1 promotes YAP1 translocation into the nuclei to activate the downstream expression, such as CTGF. Knocking down AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF enhances the therapeutic efficacies of the first-line anticancer drugs. Taken together, AMOTL1 plays an oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through interacting with YAP1 and promoting its nuclear accumulation. A combination of AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF expression might serve as a surrogate of Hippo activation status. The co-activation of the AMOTL1/YAP1-CTGF axis is associated with poor clinical outcomes of GC patients, and targeting this oncogenic axis may enhance the chemotherapeutic effects.

32332923	In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), response to platinum (PT)-based chemotherapy dictates subsequent treatments and predicts patients' prognosis. Alternative splicing is often deregulated in human cancers and can be altered by chemotherapy. Whether and how changes in alternative splicing regulation could impact on the response of EOC to PT-based chemotherapy is still not clarified. We identified the splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) as a critical mediator of response to PT in an unbiased functional genomic screening in EOC cells and, using a large cohort of primary and recurrent EOC samples, we observed that it is frequently overexpressed in recurrent PT-treated samples and that its overexpression correlates with PT resistance. At mechanistic level, we show that, under PT treatment, SFPQ, in complex with p54(nrb), binds and regulates the activity of the splicing factor SRSF2. SFPQ/p54(nrb) complex decreases SRSF2 binding to caspase-9 RNA, favoring the expression of its alternative spliced antiapoptotic form. As a consequence, SFPQ/p54(nrb) protects cells from PT-induced death, eventually contributing to chemoresistance. Overall, our work unveils a previously unreported SFPQ/p54(nrb)/SRSF2 pathway that in EOC cells plays a central role in regulating alternative splicing and PT-induced apoptosis and that could result in the design of new possible ways of intervention to overcome PT resistance.

32341409	PDZK1 downregulation was reported to independently predict poor prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and induce ccRCC development and progression. However, the underlying mechanism of PDZK1 downregulation remains unknown. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks are emerging as new players in gene regulation and are associated with cancer development. ceRNAs regulate other RNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs. To investigate the role and mechanism of ceRNAs in PDZK1 downregulation and the development of ccRCC, we searched databases for miRNAs and lncRNAs that regulate PDZK1 expression in ccRCC tissues and assessed their effects in ccRCC. We found that miR-15b was expressed at higher levels in ccRCC tissues, and its upregulation was clinically associated with lower PDZK1 level, larger tumor size and shorter survival time of ccRCC patients. Conversely, a novel lncRNA (lncPENG) was expressed at a lower level in ccRCC tissues, and its downregulation was associated with the same effects as upregulation of miR-15b. Downregulation of miR-15b and upregulation of lncPENG resulted in a significant increase in PDZK1 level and inhibition of proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lncPENG directly bound to miR-15b and effectively functioned as a sponge for miR-15b to modulate the expression of PDZK1. Thus, lncPENG may function as a ceRNA to attenuate miR-15b-dependent PDZK1 downregulation and inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting that it may be clinically valuable as a therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker of ccRCC.	Long noncoding RNA PENG upregulates PDZK1 expression by sponging miR-15b to suppress clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation.	Oncogene
32361710	The NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a member of the mammalian sirtuin family, plays a pivotal role in deacetylating histone and nonhistone proteins. Recently, it has been reported that SIRT1 is upregulated in various kinds of tumors and is associated with cell growth and metastasis. However, the factors and molecular mechanism regulating its cellular levels remain to be clarified. Here, we reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 interacts with SIRT1 and mediates its ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of SMURF2 leads to SIRT1 upregulation and induces the tumor formation and growth of colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show a negative correlation between SIRT1 and SMURF2 expression in human colorectal cancer. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism of colorectal tumorigenesis via SIRT1 regulation by SMURF2, which could potentially give rise to a new strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer.	Ubiquitination-mediated degradation of SIRT1 by SMURF2 suppresses CRC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.	Oncogene
32366907	N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation contributes to the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype through regulating gene expression. YTHDF2, an m6A reader, was shown to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient prognosis. However, the effect of YTHDF2 on liver CSC and cancer metastasis and the molecular mechanism of this effect have not been documented. Here, we show that YTHDF2 expression is negatively correlated with HCC patient survival in both data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and clinical data from our center. By detecting CD133(+) cells and carrying out sphere culture assays, we found that knockdown of YTHDF2 led to impaired stemness in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of YTHDF2 increased the CSC phenotype. Mechanistically, the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 in liver cancer cells resulted in decreased and increased m6A levels in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of OCT4 mRNA, respectively, leading to decreased and increased OCT4 protein expression, respectively. A luciferase activity assay showed that mutation of the corresponding m6A methylation sequence in the 5'-UTR of OCT4 mRNA caused significantly decreased gene expression, suggesting a role for YTHDF2-dependent m6A methylation in protein translation. Polysome profiling results also indicated the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 could decrease and increase OCT4 translation, respectively. In particular, overexpression of OCT4 rescued the impaired stemness caused by YTHDF2 depletion, which confirmed the effect of YTHDF2 on CSC phenotype is dependent on OCT4. In vivo, the loss of YTHDF2 reduced tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis following orthotopic transplantation in nude mice. Last, we demonstrated that YTHDF2 expression is positively correlated with OCT4 expression and m6A levels in the 5'-UTR of OCT4 mRNA in clinical HCC specimens. In conclusion, YTHDF2 promotes the CSC liver phenotype and cancer metastasis by modulating the m6A methylation of OCT4 mRNA.

32372060	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis is largely responsible for HCC-associated recurrence and mortality. We aimed to identify metastasis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to understand the molecular mechanism of HCC metastasis. We first identified that miR-1258 was downregulated in HCC tissues both in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) dataset. MiR-1258 expression negatively correlated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival of HCC patients. MiR-1258 overexpression inhibited migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas miR-1258 downregulation promoted cell metastasis. Luciferase assays verified direct binding of miR-1258 to Smad2 and Smad3, thereby attenuating TGF-beta/Smad signaling. We further established that lncRNA LINC01278 was a negative regulator of miR-1258. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that LINC01278-mediated HCC metastasis was dependent on miR-1258 expression. Furthermore, miR-1258 downregulation in turn increased LINC01278 expression. We also observed that TCF-4 could bind to the LINC01278 promoter site. In addition, LINC01278 downregulation decreased migration and invasion of HCC cells induced by beta-catenin and TGF-beta1 both in vitro and in vivo. We uncovered a novel mechanism for beta-catenin/TCF-4-LINC01278-miR-1258-Smad2/3 feedback loop activation in HCC metastasis, and the study indicated that LINC01278 could serve as a therapeutic target for HCC metastasis.

32398866	Klotho is a transmembrane protein, which can be shed and act as a circulating hormone and is involved in regulating cellular calcium levels and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. As a longevity hormone, it protects normal cells from oxidative stress, and as a tumor suppressor it inhibits growth of cancer cells. Mechanisms governing these differential activities have not been addressed. Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and dysregulation of mitochondrial activity is a hallmark of aging. We hypothesized that klotho exerts its differential effects through regulation of these two hallmarks. Treatment with klotho inhibited glycolysis, reduced mitochondrial activity and membrane potential only in cancer cells. Accordingly, global metabolic screen revealed that klotho altered pivotal metabolic pathways, amongst them glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in breast cancer cells. Alteration of metabolic activity and increased AMP/ATP ratio lead to LKB1-dependent AMPK activation. Indeed, klotho induced AMPK phosphorylation; furthermore, inhibition of LKB1 partially abolished klotho's tumor suppressor activity. By diminishing deltapsi (Deltapsi) klotho also inhibited mitochondria Ca(2+) shuttling thereby impairing mitochondria communication with SOCE leading to reduced Ca(2+) influx by SOCE channels. The reduced SOCE was followed by ER Ca(2+) depletion and stress. These data delineate mechanisms mediating the differential effects of klotho toward cancer versus normal cells, and indicate klotho as a potent regulator of metabolic activity.

32404984	Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, plays vital roles in energy sensing, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain less clear. Here, we report that SIRT7 is required for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest during glucose deprivation. We show that SIRT7 directly interacts with p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and the affinity for this interaction increases during glucose deprivation. Upon binding, SIRT7 deacetylates PCAF at lysine 720 (K720), which augments PCAF binding to murine double minute (MDM2), the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to accelerated MDM2 degradation. This effect results in upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor, p21(Waf1/Cip1), which further leads to cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell viability. These data highlight the importance of the SIRT7-PCAF interaction in regulating p53 activity and cell-cycle progression during conditions of glucose deprivation. This axis may represent a new avenue to design effective therapeutics based on tumor starvation.	SIRT7 activates p53 by enhancing PCAF-mediated MDM2 degradation to arrest the cell cycle.	Oncogene
32398865	Aberrant expression of laminin-332 promotes tumour growth and metastasis in multiple cancers. However, the dysregulated expression and mechanism of action of LAMB3, which encodes the beta3 subunit of laminin-332, and the mechanism underlying dysregulated LAMB3 expression in CRC remain obscure. Here, we show that LAMB3 is overexpressed in CRC and that this overexpression is correlated with tumour metastasis and poor prognosis. Overexpression of LAMB3 promoted cell proliferation and cell migration in vitro and tumour growth and metastasis in vivo, while knockdown of LAMB3 elicited opposing effects. LAMB3 inhibited the tumour suppressive function of FOXO3/4 by activating AKT in CRC. Both the BET inhibitor JQ1 and the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased the mRNA level of LAMB3 in multiple CRC cells. Mechanistically, ELK4 cooperated with BRD2 to regulate the transcription of LAMB3 in CRC by directly binding to the ETS binding motifs in the LAMB3 promoter. ELK4 was as acetylated at K125, which enhanced the interaction between ELK4 and BRD2. JQ1 disrupted the interaction between ELK4 and BRD2, resulting in decreased binding of BRD2 to the LAMB3 promoter and downregulation of LAMB3 transcription. Both ELK4 and BRD2 expression was associated with LAMB3 expression in CRC. LAMB3 expression was also negatively correlated with FOXO3/4 in CRC. Our study reveals the pro-tumorigenic role of LAMB3 through the AKT-FOXO3/4 axis and the transcriptional mechanism of LAMB3 in CRC, demonstrating that LAMB3 is a potential therapeutic target that can be targeted by BET inhibitors and MEK inhibitors.	LAMB3 promotes tumour progression through the AKT-FOXO3/4 axis and is transcriptionally regulated by the BRD2/acetylated ELK4 complex in colorectal cancer.	Oncogene
32398867	We previously identified that the development of early-stage myeloid-derived suppressor cells (eMDSCs) in breast cancer with high IL-6 (IL-6(high)) expression was correlated with the SOCS3 deficiency-dependent hyperactivation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. However, the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the posttranscriptional regulation mediated by cancer exosome-derived miRNAs affected the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the development of eMDSCs. Using miRNA microarray, we screened miR-9 and miR-181a which were exclusively upregulated in eMDSCs and inversely associated with SOCS3 expression. We found both miRNAs promoted the amplification of immature eMDSCs with the strong suppression on T-cell immunity in mice and humans. Furthermore, miR-9 and miR-181a promoted 4T1 tumor growth and immune escape via enhancing eMDSCs infiltration in situ. But miR-9 and miR-181a stimulated eMDSCs development by separately inhibiting SOCS3 and PIAS3, two crucial regulators in the negative feedback loop of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Elevated miR-9 and miR-181a in eMDSCs was derived from tumor-derived exosomes, and blocking the exosome release could fully attenuate the miRNA-mediated regulation on eMDSCs development. In summary, our findings indicated that tumor exosome-derived miR-9 and miR-181a activated the JAK/STAT signaling pathway via targeting SOCS3 and PIAS3, respectively, and thus promoted the expansion of eMDSCs which might provide potential therapeutic target for IL-6(high) breast cancer treatment.

32404985	The overexpression of SOX4 in various kinds of cancer cells was associated with poor prognosis for patients. The role of SOX4 in angiogenesis and tumor microenvironment modulation was recently documented in breast cancer but remains unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our study, the clinical relevance of SOX4 overexpression in HCC and its role in the tumor microenvironment were investigated. The overexpression of SOX4 (SOX4(high)) in tumor lesions was associated with higher microvessel density (P = 0.012), tumor thrombosis formation (P = 0.012), distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival in HCC patients (P = 0.048). Endogenous SOX4 knockout in Hep3B cells by the CRISPR/cas9 system reduced the expression of CXCL12, which, in turn, attenuated chemotaxis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, tube formation in vitro, reduced tumor growth, reticular fiber production, and angiogenesis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. Treatment with an antagonist targeting CXCR4 (AMD3100), a receptor of CXCL12, inhibited chemotaxis and tube formation in endothelial cells in vitro. The CXCL12 promoter was activated by ectopic expression of a Flag-tagged SOX4 plasmid, endogenous SOX4 knockdown abolished promoter activity of CXCL12 as shown by luciferase assays, and an association with the CXCL12 promoter was identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation in HCC cells. In conclusion, SOX4 modulates the CXCL12 promoter in HCC cells. The secretory CXCL12, in turn, modulates CXCR4 in endothelial cells, reticular fibers to regulate the tumor microenvironment and modulate neovascularization, which might contribute to the distant metastasis of tumors.

32457468	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor outcomes associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which silences transcription through trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and has emerged as an important therapeutic target with inhibitors targeting its methyltransferase activity under clinical investigation. Here, we show that EZH2 has a non-catalytic and PRC2-independent role in stabilizing DDB2 to promote nucleotide excision repair (NER) and govern cisplatin resistance in SCLC. Using a synthetic lethality screen, we identified important regulators of cisplatin resistance in SCLC cells, including EZH2. EZH2 depletion causes cellular cisplatin and UV hypersensitivity in an epistatic manner with DDB1-DDB2. EZH2 complexes with DDB1-DDB2 and promotes DDB2 stability by impairing its ubiquitination independent of methyltransferase activity or PRC2, thereby facilitating DDB2 localization to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer crosslinks to govern their repair. Furthermore, targeting EZH2 for depletion with DZNep strongly sensitizes SCLC cells and tumors to cisplatin. Our findings reveal a non-catalytic and PRC2-independent function for EZH2 in promoting NER through DDB2 stabilization, suggesting a rationale for targeting EZH2 beyond its catalytic activity for overcoming cisplatin resistance in SCLC.

32499521	The mechanistic action of histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) in cancer motility, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), remains largely undefined. We found that the expression of HDAC8 was upregulated in breast cancer (BC) cells and tissues as compared to the controls. Further, BC tissues had the highest values of HDAC8 expression among 31 kinds of cancers. Cellular study indicated that HDAC8 can positively regulate the dissemination and EMT of BC cells. It increased the protein stability of Snail, an important regulator of EMT, by phosphorylation of its motif 2 in serine-rich regions. There are 21 factors that have been reported to regulate the protein stability of Snail. Among them, HDAC8 can decrease the expression of GSK-3beta through increasing its Ser9-phosphorylation. Mass spectrum analysis indicated that HDAC8 interact with AKT1 to decrease its acetylation while increase its phosphorylation, which further increased Ser9-phosphorylation of GSK-3beta. The C-terminal of AKT1 was responsible for the interaction between HDAC8 and AKT1. Further, Lys426 was the key residue for HDAC8-regulated deacetylation of AKT1. Moreover, HDAC8/Snail axis acted as adverse prognosis factors for in vivo progression and overall survival (OS) rate of BC patients. Collectively, we found that HDAC8 can trigger the dissemination of BC cells via AKT/GSK-3beta/Snail signals, which imposed that inhibition of HDAC8 is a potential approach for BC treatment.

32518375	Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) is an interferon-inducible large GTPase which is crucial to the protective immunity against microorganisms. However, its biological function in cancer remains largely unknown. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadly brain tumor in adults. Here we show that GBP2 expression is highly elevated in GBM tumor and cell lines, particularly in those of the mesenchymal subtype. High GBP2 expression is associated with poor prognosis. GBP2 overexpression significantly promotes GBM cell migration and invasion in vitro, and GBP2 silencing by RNA interference exhibits opposite effects. We further show that fibronectin (FN1) is dramatically induced by GBP2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and FN1 is essential for GBP2-promoted GBM invasiveness. Inhibition of Stat3 pathway prevents GBP2-promoted FN1 induction and cell invasion. Consistently, GBP2 dramatically promotes GBM tumor growth and invasion in mice and significantly reduces the survival time of the mice with tumor. Taken together, these findings establish the role of GBP2/Stat3/FN1 signaling cascade in GBM invasion and suggest GBP2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion.

32518374	Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF) is a transcription factor and tyrosine kinase. WSTF overexpression promotes migration and proliferation of various cancers, and Ser158 (WSTF(S158)) phosphorylation plays an important role in this process. However, the role of the other posttranslational modifications of WSTF is unknown. Here, we report that lysine (K) 426 on WSTF is acetylated by MOF and deacetylated by SIRT1. Mechanistically, male-specific lethal (MSL) 1v1 interaction with WSTF facilitates its interaction with MOF for WSTF acetylation, which in turn promotes WSTF(S158) phosphorylation. The kinase and transcriptional regulatory activity of WSTF were enhanced by acetylation. WSTF(K426ac) levels positively and significantly correlated with tumor size, histological grade, and age. Moreover, we demonstrated that acetylated WSTF promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor formation. In conclusion, we identified the enzymes regulating WSTF K426 acetylation, and demonstrated an acetylation-dependent mechanism that modulates the activities of WSTF and contributes to tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new clues to study WSTF-mediated normal development and disease.	WSTF acetylation by MOF promotes WSTF activities and oncogenic functions.	Oncogene
32541839	The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as two complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2), regulating cell growth and metabolism. Aberrant mTOR signaling occurs frequently in cancers, so mTOR has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. Iron chelators have emerged as promising anticancer agents. However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead, activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3 pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition. Our findings indicate that iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 via multiple pathways and iron is essential for mTORC1 activation.

32555333	Mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53 are rare in renal cell carcinomas. p53 is a key factor for inducing antiangiogenic genes and RCC are highly vascularized, which suggests that p53 is inactive in these tumors. One regulator of p53 is the Mdm2 oncogene, which is correlated with high-grade, metastatic tumors. However, the sole activity of Mdm2 is not just to regulate p53, but it can also function independent of p53 to regulate the early stages of metastasis. Here, we report that the oncoprotein Mdm2 can bind directly to the tumor suppressor VHL, and conjugate nedd8 to VHL within a region that is important for the p53-VHL interaction. Nedd8 conjugated VHL is unable to bind to p53 thereby preventing the induction of antiangiogenic factors. These results highlight a previously unknown oncogenic function of Mdm2 during the progression of cancer to promote angiogenesis through the regulation of VHL. Thus, the Mdm2-VHL interaction represents a pathway that impacts tumor angiogenesis.	Mdm2-mediated neddylation of pVHL blocks the induction of antiangiogenic factors.	Oncogene
32555329	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cancer development and progression, and some function in a highly cancer-specific manner. However, whether the cause of their expression is an outcome of a specific regulatory mechanism or nonspecific transcription induced by genome reorganization in cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated a group of lncRNAs that we previously identified to be aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer (PC), called TPCATs. Our high-throughput real-time PCR experiments were integrated with publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data and revealed that the expression of a subset of TPCATs is driven by PC-specific transcription factors (TFs), especially androgen receptor (AR) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Our in vitro validations confirmed that AR and ERG regulated a subset of TPCATs, most notably for EPCART. Knockout of EPCART was found to reduce migration and proliferation of the PC cells in vitro. The high expression of EPCART and two other TPCATs (TPCAT-3-174133 and TPCAT-18-31849) were also associated with the biochemical recurrence of PC in prostatectomy patients and were independent prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the expression of numerous PC-associated lncRNAs is driven by PC-specific mechanisms and not by random cellular events that occur during cancer development. Furthermore, we report three prospective prognostic markers for the early detection of advanced PC and show EPCART to be a functionally relevant lncRNA in PC.

32561851	In response to genotoxic stress, multiple kinase signaling cascades are activated, many of them directed towards the tumor suppressor p53, which coordinates the DNA damage response (DDR). Defects in DDR pathways lead to an accumulation of mutations that can promote tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence implicates multiple members of the NimA-related kinase (NEK) family (NEK1, NEK10, and NEK11) in the DDR. Here, we describe a function for NEK10 in the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity through tyrosine phosphorylation. NEK10 loss increases cellular proliferation by modulating the p53-dependent transcriptional output. NEK10 directly phosphorylates p53 on Y327, revealing NEK10's unexpected substrate specificity. A p53 mutant at this site (Y327F) acts as a hypomorph, causing an attenuated p53-mediated transcriptional response. Consistently, NEK10-deficient cells display heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Further, a combinatorial score of NEK10 and TP53-target gene expression is an independent predictor of a favorable outcome in breast cancers.

32555330	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck cancer with highly aggressive and metastatic potential in which distant metastasis is the main reason for treatment failure. Till present, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NPC metastasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identified S100 calcium-binding protein A14 (S100A14) as a functional regulator suppressing NPC metastasis by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway and reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). S100A14 was found to be downregulated in highly metastatic NPC cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of 202 NPC samples revealed that lower S100A14 expression was significantly correlated with shorter patient overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). S100A14 was also found as an independent prognostic factor for favorable survival. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirmed that S100A14 suppressed the in vitro and in vivo motility of NPC cells. Mechanistically, S100A14 promoted the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to suppress NPC cellular migration. Moreover, S100A14 and IRAK1 established a feedback loop that could be disrupted by the IRAK1 inhibitor T2457. Overall, our findings showed that the S100A14-IRAK1 feedback loop could be a promising therapeutic target for NPC metastasis.

32576970	Increasing evidence supports that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as master regulators involved in tumorigenesis and development at the N6-methyladenine (m(6)A) epigenetic modification level. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism in breast cancer (BRCA) remains elusive. Here, we unveil that LINC00942 (LNC942) exerts its functions as an oncogene in promoting METTL14-mediated m(6)A methylation and regulating the expression and stability of its target genes CXCR4 and CYP1B1 in BRCA initiation and progression. Specifically, LNC942 and METTL14 were significantly upregulated accompanied with the upregulation of m(6)A levels in BRCA cells and our included BRCA cohorts (n = 150). Functionally, LNC942 elicits potent oncogenic effects on promoting cell proliferation and colony formation and inhibiting cell apoptosis, subsequently elevating METTL14-mediated m(6)A methylation levels and its associated mRNA stability and protein expression of CXCR4 and CYP1B1 in BRCA cells. Mechanistically, LNC942 directly recruits METTL14 protein by harboring the specific recognize sequence (+176-+265), thereby stabilized the expression of downstream targets of LNC942 including CXCR4 and CYP1B1 through posttranscriptional m(6)A methylation modification in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC942-METTL14-CXCR4/CYP1B1 signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk m(6)A epigenetic modification mechanism for BRCA prevention and treatment.

32561852	Cancer stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and resistance to chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to understand the molecular regulators of stemness in the quest to develop effective cancer therapies. TAZ is a transcription activator that promotes stem cell functions in post-development mammalian cells; suppression of TAZ activity reduces or eliminates cancer stemness in select cancers. Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) is the unique enzyme of the last step of posttranslational prenylation processing pathway that modifies several oncogenic proteins, including RAS. We found that suppression of ICMT results in reduced self-renewal/stemness in KRAS-driven pancreatic and breast cancer cells. Silencing of ICMT led to significant reduction of TAZ protein levels and loss of self-renewal ability, which could be reversed by overexpressing mutant KRAS, demonstrating the functional impact of ICMT modification on the ability of KRAS to control TAZ stability and function. Contrary to expectation, YAP protein levels appear to be much less susceptible than TAZ to the regulation by ICMT and KRAS, and YAP is less consequential in regulating stemness characteristics in these cells. Further, we found that the ICMT-dependent KRAS regulation of TAZ was mediated through RAF, but not PI3K, signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that a signaling cascade from ICMT modification of KRAS to TAZ protein stability supports cancer cell self-renewal abilities in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In addition, studies using the proof-of-concept small molecule inhibitors of ICMT confirmed its role in regulating TAZ and self-renewal, demonstrating the potential utility of targeting ICMT to control aggressive KRAS-driven cancers.

32572158	SDCBP is an adapter protein containing two tandem PDZ domains mediating cell adhesion. The role and underlying molecular mechanism of SDCBP in ESCC remain obscure. Here, we report that SDCBP is frequently overexpressed in ESCC tissues and cells compared to normal controls and that its overexpression is correlated with late clinical stage and predicts poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Functionally, high expression of SDCBP is positively related to ESCC progression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, mechanistic studies show that SDCBP activates the EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by binding to EGFR and preventing EGFR internalization. Moreover, we provide evidence that AURKA binds to SDCBP and phosphorylates it at the Ser131 and Thr200 sites to inhibit ubiquitination-mediated SDCBP degradation. More importantly, the sites at which AURKA phosphorylates SDCBP are crucial for the EGFR signaling-mediated oncogenic function of SDCBP. Taken together, we propose that SDCBP phosphorylation by AURKA prevents SDCBP degradation and promotes ESCC tumor growth through the EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings unveil a new AURKA-SDCBP-EGFR axis that is involved in ESCC progression and provide a promising therapeutic target for ESCC treatment in the clinic.

31822797	Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is a member of the arm-repeat (armadillo) and plakophilin gene families and it is an essential component of the desmosomes. Although desmosomes have generally been associated with tumor suppressor functions, we have consistently observed that PKP1 is among the top overexpressed proteins in squamous cell lung cancer. To explore this paradox, we developed in vivo and in vitro functional models of PKP1 gain/loss in squamous cell lung cancer. CRISPR-Cas9 PKP1 knockout severely impaired cell proliferation, but it increased cell dissemination. In addition, PKP1 overexpression increased cell proliferation, cell survival, and in vivo xenograft engraftment. We further investigated the molecular mechanism of the mainly oncogenic function of PKP1 by combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and protein-nucleic acid interaction assays. Interestingly, we found that PKP1 enhances MYC translation in collaboration with the translation initiation complex by binding to the 5'-UTR of MYC mRNA. We propose PKP1 as an oncogene in SqCLC and a novel posttranscriptional regulator of MYC. PKP1 may be a valuable diagnostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for SqCLC. Importantly, PKP1 inhibition may indirectly target MYC, a primary anticancer target.	Plakophilin 1 enhances MYC translation, promoting squamous cell lung cancer.	Oncogene
32632220	RNA-binding proteins play key roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA during cancer progression. Here, we show that RNA-binding motif protein 43 (RBM43) is significantly downregulated in human tumors, and its low expression is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Overexpression of RBM43 suppressed cell proliferation in culture and resulted in the growth arrest of tumor xenografts, whereas downregulating RBM43 played an opposite role. We have also demonstrated that overexpression or knockdown of RBM43 affects the cell-cycle progression of liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, RBM43 directly associated with the 3'UTR of Cyclin B1 mRNA and regulated its expression. Moreover, loss of Rbm43 in mice promoted liver carcinogenesis and HCC development after diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that RBM43 is a tumor suppressor that controls the cell cycle through modulation of Cyclin B1 expression, providing evidence that RBM43 is particularly important in HCC.

32690868	NORE1A (RASSF5) is a tumor suppressor of the Ras-association domain family (RASSF) that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its growth inhibition function remains largely undefined. Here we report that NORE1A antagonizes tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRI) through the assembly of ITCH-mediated destruction complex to suppress TNF-NF-kappaB signaling and tumorigenesis. Moreover, NORE1A is identified as a transcription target of NF-kappaB, which directs an apoptotic switch of TNF effect by blocking ITCH interaction with and ubiquitination of BAX. Mechanistically, NORE1A binds directly to TNFRI and ITCH via the C1 and PPXY domains, respectively to facilitate the formation of ITCH-mediated destruction complex followed by ubiquitination-mediated lysosomal degradation of TNFRI. Through this function, NORE1A suppresses TNF-induced NF-kappaB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting genes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration of tumor cells, and also debilitates tumor cell activation of macrophage and fibroblast. While NORE1A suppresses TNF receptor-mediated apoptosis, it activates TNF-induced apoptosis through BAX activation by protecting BAX from ITCH binding and ubiquitination. Cytotoxic response to TNF is substantially attenuated in NORE1A-depleted cells and tumors, and NORE1A-induced tumor regression is highly impeded in BAX-depleted tumors. An inverse correlation is shown between NORE1A and TNFRI expression in both cancer cell lines and primary tumors, and NORE1A effect on survival of cancer patients is strongly associated with expression status of ITCH. Collectively, this study uncovers that NORE1A directs a substrate switch of ITCH favoring TNFRI over BAX to terminate TNF signaling and accelerate apoptosis, illuminating the mechanistic consequence of NORE1A inactivation in tumorigenesis.

32704133	LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is a metastasis-related protein reported to enhance tumour progression in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism is still elusive. As the major biological and pathological functions of LASP1 are accomplished by its LIM and SH3 domains via protein-protein interactions, a yeast two-hybrid system was employed to screen novel LASP1-interacting proteins. N-WASP, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, was screened and identified as a LASP1-interacting protein overexpressed in CRC tissues. N-WASP could stimulate the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro and increase the formation of subcutaneous tumours, mesenteric implanted tumours and hepatic metastatic tumours. N-WASP could interact with and activate the Arp2/3 complex to stimulate actin polymerization, thus changing the migratory and invasive capabilities of CRC cells. The interaction of LASP1 with N-WASP did not influence the expression of N-WASP but recovered the reduced actin polymerization induced by N-WASP silencing. High N-WASP expression was detected in most clinical colorectal samples, and it was positively correlated with the expression of LASP1 and ARP3, as well as the tumour budding and pattern of invasion, but negatively correlated with host lymphocytic response. Our study suggests a new mechanism for LASP1-mediated CRC metastasis determined by exploring LASP1-interacting proteins and identifies N-WASP as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

32719439	Cumulative evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) promote gene expression in cancers. However, the pathophysiologic relevance of miRNA-mediated RNA activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be established. Our previous miRNA expression profiling in seven-paired HCC specimens revealed miR-93-5p as an HCC-related miRNA. In this study, miR-93-5p expression was assessed in HCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The correlation of miR-93-5p expression with survival and clinicopathological features of HCC was determined by statistical analysis. The function and potential mechanism of miR-93-5p in HCC were further investigated by a series of gain- or loss-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo. We identified that miR-93-5p, overexpressed in HCC specimens and cell lines, leads to poor outcomes in HCC cases and promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC cell lines. Mechanistically, rather than decreasing target mRNA levels as expected, miR-93-5p binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) to directly upregulate its expression and downstream p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, thereby leading to cell cycle progression in HCC. Notably, we also demonstrated that c-Jun, a downstream effector of the JNK pathway, enhances miR-93-5p transcription by targeting its promoter region. Besides, downregulation of miR-93-5p significantly retarded tumor growth, while overexpression of miR-93-5p accelerated tumor growth in the HCC xenograft mouse model. Altogether, we revealed a miR-93-5p/MAP3K2/c-Jun positive feedback loop to promote HCC progression in vivo and in vitro, representing an RNA-activating role of miR-93-5p in HCC development.	microRNA-93-5p promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via a microRNA-93-5p/MAP3K2/c-Jun positive feedback circuit.

32753651	Chemoresistance is a major obstacle to prolonging pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient survival. TET1 is identified as the most important epigenetic modification enzyme that facilitates chemoresistance in cancers. However, the chemoresistance mechanism of TET1 in PDAC is unknown. This study aimed to determine the role of TET1 in the chemoresistance of PDAC. TET1-associated chemoresistance in PDAC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The clinical significance of TET1 was analyzed in 228 PDAC patients by tissue microarray profiling. We identified that TET1 downregulation is caused by its promoter hypermethylation and correlates with poor survival in PDAC patients. In vitro and in vivo functional studies performed by silencing or overexpressing TET1 suggested that TET1 is able to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and sensitize PDAC cells to 5FU and gemcitabine. Then RNA-seq, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and ChIP-seq were used to explore the TET1-associated pathway, and showed that TET1 promotes the transcription of CHL1 by binding and demethylating the CHL1 promoter, which consequently inhibits the Hedgehog pathway. Additionally, inhibiting Hedgehog signaling by CHL1 overexpression or the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, GDC-0449, reversed the chemoresistance induced by TET1 silencing. Regarding clinical significance, we found that high TET1 and high CHL1 expression predicted a better prognosis in resectable PDAC patients. In summary, we demonstrated that TET1 reverses chemoresistance in PDAC by downregulating the CHL1-associated Hedgehog signaling pathway. PDAC patients with a high expression levels of TET1 and CHL1 have a better prognosis.

32616890	Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common and highly invasive form of cancer. SCC arises due to ultraviolet light exposure and is associated with increased expression of pro-cancer genes and reduced expression of cancer suppressors. Actin-Like Protein 6A (ACTL6A, BAF53a) is an important protein subunit of the SWI/SNF epigenetic chromatin regulatory complex. ACTL6A is elevated in cancer cells and has been implicated as a driver of cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In the present study, we show that ACTL6A drives SCC cell proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and that these activities are markedly reduced by ACTL6A knockdown. We further show that ACTL6A expression is associated with reduced levels of the p21(Cip1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor protein. Molecular studies show that ACTL6A interacts with p53 DNA response elements in the p21(Cip1) gene promoter to suppress p21(Cip1) promoter activity and mRNA and protein level. Additional studies show that an increase in p21(Cip1) expression in ACTL6A knockdown cells is required for suppression of the SCC cell phenotype, suggesting that p21(Cip1) is a mediator of ACTL6A action. We further show that this regulation is p53 independent. These findings suggest that ACTL6A suppresses p21(Cip1) promoter activity to reduce p21(Cip1) protein as a mechanism to maintain the aggressive epidermal SCC phenotype.

32737433	PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activity is highly elevated in glioblastoma (GBM). Although rapamycin is known to inhibit this pathway, GBM patients are resistant to rapamycin monotherapy. This may be related to mutations of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Here, we show that higher expression of E3 ligase Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) in GBM is correlated with poor prognosis. Smurf1 promotes cell growth and colony formation by accelerating cell cycle and aberrant signaling pathways. In addition, we show that Smurf1 ubiquitylates and degrades PTEN. We further demonstrate that the oncogenic role of Smurf1 is dependent on PTEN. Upregulated Smurf1 impairs PTEN activity, leading to consistent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; and depletion of Smurf1 dramatically inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover, loss of Smurf1 abolishes the aberrant regulation of PTEN, causing negative feedback on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and thus leading to rescue of tumor sensitivity to rapamycin in an orthotopic GBM model. Taken together, we show that Smurf1 promotes tumor progression via PTEN, and combined treatment of Smurf1 knockdown with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition reduces tumor progression. These results identify a unique role of Smurf1 in mTOR inhibitor resistance and provide a strong rationale for combined therapy targeting GBM.

32753650	Oligodendroglioma is an important type of lower-grade glioma (LGG), which is a slowly progressing brain tumor. Many LGGs eventually transform into a more aggressive or malignant type. Enhanced angiogenesis is a characteristic of malignantly transformed oligodendroglioma (m-oligodendroglioma). However, the pathogenesis and signaling pathways associated with angiogenesis and proliferation in m-oligodendroglioma are not well understood. In this study, we identified that Insulin Gene Enhancer Protein (ISL2) and its angiogenic capacity were inversely related to survival according to LGG patient data from an online database, and this was further confirmed with pathological LGG patient samples, including malignantly transformed samples, by detecting the expression of ISL2, the angiogenic markers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) and CD31 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. We then established novel oligodendroglioma patient tumor-derived orthotopic xenograft mouse models and cell lines to verify the role of ISL2 in regulating angiogenesis to promote oligodendroglioma growth and malignant transformation. Furthermore, ISL2 regulated ANGPT2 transcription by binding to the ANGPT2 promoter. Then, ANGPT2, a downstream gene, activated angiogenesis through VEGFA to promote oligodendroglioma malignant transformation. Finally, combining AAV-ISL2-shRNA with temozolomide suppressed oligodendroglioma progression more effectively than either monotherapy in vivo and in vitro. Thus, hypoxia-induced ISL2 regulated ANGPT2, which subsequently induced angiogenesis to promote oligodendroglioma growth and malignant transformation. Malignancy was accompanied by worsened hypoxia inside the tumor mass, creating a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, this study suggests that ISL2 is a biomarker for oligodendroglioma progression and that anti-ISL2 therapy may offer a potential clinical strategy for treating m-oligodendroglioma.	ISL2 modulates angiogenesis through transcriptional regulation of ANGPT2 to promote cell proliferation and malignant transformation in oligodendroglioma.	Oncogene
32772043	Aurora B kinase plays essential roles in mitosis. Its protein levels increase before the onset of mitosis and sharply decrease during mitosis exit. The latter decrease is due to a balance between the actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (activated by the Cdh1 adapter), and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP35. Aurora B also executes important functions in interphase. Abnormal modulation of Aurora B in interphase leads to cell cycle defects often linked to aberrant chromosomal condensation and segregation. Very little is however known about how Aurora B levels are regulated in interphase. Here we found that USP13-associates with and stabilizes Aurora B in cells, especially before their entry into mitosis. In order for USP13 to exert its stabilizing effect on Aurora B, their association is promoted by the Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of USP13 at Serine 114. We also present evidence that USP13 instigates Aurora B deubiquitination and/or protect it from degradation in a non-catalytic manner. In addition, we report that genetic or chemical modulation of the cellular levels/activity of USP13 affects unperturbed cell-cycle progression. Overall our study unveils the molecular and cellular connections of the USP13-Aurora B axis, which potentially participates in the rewiring of the cell cycle happening in cancer cells.

32778769	Metastatic breast cancer is characterized by high mortality and limited therapeutic target. During tumor metastasis, cytoskeletal reorganization is one of the key steps in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that plays an important role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Previous researches have reported that altered CRMP2 expression is associated with breast cancer progression, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that CRMP2 expression is reduced in various subtypes of breast cancers and negatively correlated with lymphatic metastasis. Overexpression of CRMP2 significantly inhibits invasion and stemness in breast cancer cells, while downregulation of CRMP2 promotes cell invasion, which is not required for tubulin polymerization. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that CRMP2 interacts with RECK, prevents RECK degradation, which, in turn, blocks NF-kappaB and Wnt signaling pathways. Furthermore, we find that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at T514 and S522 remarkably abolishes its functions to bind with RECK and to inhibit cell invasion. Pharmacologic rescue of CRMP2 expression suppressed breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo and stimulated a synergetic effect with FN-1501 that induces CRMP2 dephosphorylation. Collectively, this study highlights the potential of CRMP2 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer metastasis and reveals a distinct mechanism of CRMP2.

32801337	The mechanistic basis of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer remains poorly understood. We previously reported that the sclerostin domain containing-1 (SOSTDC1) protein is overexpressed in the secretome of metastatic colorectal cancer cells and can inhibit liver homing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of SOSTDC1 for promoting invasiveness and progression of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. SOSTDC1 inhibition of BMP4 maintains the expression of cancer stem cell traits, including SOX2 and NANOG. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses reveal the association of SOSTDC1 with ALCAM/CD166, which was confirmed by confocal microscopy and competition ELISA. Interaction with ALCAM is mediated by the N-terminal region of SOSTDC1, which contains a sequence similar to the ALCAM-binding motif used by CD6. Knocking down either SOSTDC1 or ALCAM expression, or using blocking antibodies, reduces the invasive activity by inhibiting Src and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, ALCAM interacts with the alpha2ss1 and alpha1ss1 integrins, providing a possible link to Src activation. Finally, inoculation of SOSTDC1-silenced metastatic cells increases mouse survival by inhibiting liver metastasis. In conclusion, SOSTDC1 promotes invasion and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, by overcoming BMP4-specific antimetastatic signals and inducing ALCAM-mediated Src and PI3K/AKT activation. These experiments underscore the potential of SOSTDC1 as a therapeutic target in metastatic colorectal cancer.

32820252	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major cause of cancer-associated death worldwide, but its underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play an important role in the aberrant regulation of gene expression in many cancers, including NSCLC. Here, we investigated the involvement of the lncRNA KTN1-AS1 in NSCLC. We found that KTN1-AS1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissue and was positively associated with poor prognosis. KTN1-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell growth and proliferation, increased apoptosis, and modulated the expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins (cyclin A1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, Bcl2, and Bax) in NSCLC cell lines and tumour xenografts in nude mice. KTN1-AS1 bound to and directly regulated the expression of miR-130a-5p. Notably, miR-130a-5p overexpression suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and this effect was reversed by KTN1-AS1 overexpression. Finally, we showed that KTN1-AS1 modulated the expression of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), a miR-130a-5p target and key regulator of autophagy in NSCLC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the KTN1-AS1/miR-130a-5p/PDPK1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

32820249	Glioma reported to be refractory to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is the most common malignant tumor in central nervous system. Our research showed the low expression of miR-450a-5p and high expression of EGFR in glioma tissues. MiR-450a-5p was also observed to synergize with gefitinib to inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion and induce the apoptosis and autophagy of glioma cells. Furthermore, miR-450a-5p was demonstrated to target 3'UTR of EGFR, and regulated EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, the above effects induced by miR-450a-5p in glioma cells were reversed by WIPI1 silencing. The inhibition role of miR-450a-5p on glioma growth was also confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous and intracranial tumor xenografts. Therefore, we conclude that miR-450a-5p synergizes with gefitinib to inhibit the glioma tumorigenesis through inducing autophagy by regulating the EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the drug sensitivity of gefitinib.

32826949	Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers without druggable molecular targets. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcriptional factor that promotes malignancy in various cancers including pancreatic cancer. Herein, we found that HIF-1 is accumulated in normoxic or moderate hypoxic areas of pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo and is active even during normoxia in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. This prompted us to analyze whether the HIF-1 activator Mint3 contributes to malignant features of pancreatic cancer. Mint3 depletion by shRNAs attenuated HIF-1 activity during normoxia and cell proliferation concomitantly with accumulated p21 and p27 protein in pancreatic cancer cells. Further analyses revealed that Mint3 increased transcription of the oncogenic ubiquitin ligase SKP2 in pancreatic cancer cells via HIF-1. This Mint3-HIF-1-SKP2 axis also promoted partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness features, and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Even in vivo, Mint3 depletion attenuated tumor growth of orthotopically inoculated human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells. Database and tissue microarray analyses showed that Mint3 expression is correlated with SKP2 expression in human pancreatic cancer specimens and high Mint3 expression is correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, targeting Mint3 may be useful for attenuating the malignant features of pancreatic cancer.	Mint3 depletion restricts tumor malignancy of pancreatic cancer cells by decreasing SKP2 expression via HIF-1.	Oncogene
32855524	In patients with lung cancer, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been reported to be significantly increased. Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) from various cancers played a critical role in MDSC induction. However, studies on the molecular mechanism underlying MDSC expansion induced by exosomes from lung cancer cells are still limited. In this study, we demonstrated that LLC-Exo accelerated tumor growth along with a significant accumulation of MDSCs in mouse tumor model. miRNA profiling showed that miR-21a was enriched in LLC-Exo. The depletion of miR-21a in LLC-Exo leads to the loss of their ability to induce MDSC expansion. Further results showed that miR-21a of LLC-Exo induced MDSC expansion via downregulation of the programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) protein. The results of gain-and loss-of-function experiments validated that PDCD4 function as a critical inhibitor to negatively regulate expansion of MDSCs via inhibition Il-6 production in bone marrow cells. In addition, our data showed that exosomes derived from human lung cancer cell lines expressing miR-21a, also induced expansion of MDSCs in human CD14(+) monocytes in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrated that miR-21a enriched in lung carcinoma cell-derived exosomes could promote functional expansion of MDSCs through targeting PDCD4.	miR-21a in exosomes from Lewis lung carcinoma cells accelerates tumor growth through targeting PDCD4 to enhance expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

32855526	DNA methylation is implicated in the acquisition of malignant phenotypes, and the use of epigenetic modulating drugs is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (decitabine, 5-azadC) is an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor with proven effectiveness against hematological malignancies and more recently triple-negative breast cancer (BC). Herein, genetic or pharmacological studies uncovered a hitherto unknown feedforward molecular link between DNMT1 and the estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha), a key transcriptional regulator of cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, DNMT1 promotes ERRalpha stability which in turn couples DNMT1 transcription with that of the methionine cycle and S-adenosylmethionine synthesis to drive DNA methylation. In vitro and in vivo investigation using a pre-clinical mouse model of BC demonstrated a clear therapeutic advantage for combined administration of the ERRalpha inhibitor C29 with 5-azadC. A large-scale bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis revealed specific methylation perturbations fostering the discovery that reversal of promoter hypermethylation and consequently derepression of the tumor suppressor gene, IRF4, is a factor underlying the observed BC suppressive effects. This work thus uncovers a critical role of ERRalpha in the crosstalk between transcriptional control of metabolism and epigenetics and illustrates the potential for targeting ERRalpha in combination with DNMT inhibitors for BC treatment and other epigenetics-driven malignancies.

32879444	Emerging evidence indicates that myeloma overexpressed (MYEOV) is an oncogene and plays crucial roles in multiple human cancers. However, its roles in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence of essential roles of MYEOV in the development and progression of PDAC. In tumor specimens derived from pancreatic cancer patients, MYEOV was overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. In addition, MYEOV expression in PDAC was upregulated through promoter hypomethylation. MYEOV depletion impaired metastatic ability and proliferation of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effect. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MYEOV interacted with SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9 (SOX9), a well-known oncogenic transcription factor in PDAC. This interaction occurred mainly in the nuclei of PDAC cells and increased transcriptional activity of SOX9. Furthermore, MYEOV promoted the expression of Hairy and enhancer of split homolog-1 (HES1), a SOX9 target gene, by enhancing SOX9 DNA-binding ability to the HES1 enhancer without affecting the protein level and subcellular localization of SOX9. HES1 knockdown partly abrogated the oncogenic effect of MYEOV. Our findings suggest that MYEOV could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.

32901105	Current reports refer to the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) as a tumor suppressor in some types of cancer but as an oncogene in other kinds of cancer. In gastric cancer, it had been reported to be downregulated. However, the clinical significance and underlying mechanism of PART1 function in gastric cancer remains undefined. Here, seven differential expression levels of noncoding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were screened from gastric cancer through a probe reannotation of a human exon array. PART1 was selected for further study because of its high fold change number. In our cohort, PART1 was identified as a significant downregulated lncRNA in gastric cancer tissues by qPCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), and its low expression was significantly correlated with postoperative metastasis and short overall survival time after surgery. Through the results of gain-of-function experiments, PART1 was confirmed as a tumor suppressor that can decrease not only cell viability, migration, and invasion in vitro but also tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) showed that PART1 interacts with androgen receptor (AR), and then, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is upregulated in an androgen-independent manner. In a chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay additionally illustrated that PLZF upregulation increased the enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27 trimethylation in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFB) promotor, thereby inhibition of PDGFB and the subsequent PDGFRbeta/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Based on these findings, we showed PART1 plays a tumor suppressor role by promoting PLZF expression followed by recruitment of EZH2 to mediate epigenetic PDGFB silencing and downstream PI3K/Akt inhibition, suggesting that PART1 has a key role in restraining the aggressive ability of GC cells and providing a novel perspective on lncRNAs in GC progression.

32917956	Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and metastatic progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, cellular communication between heterogeneous HCC cells with different metastatic potentials and the resultant cancer progression are not fully understood in HCC. Here, HCC cells with high-metastatic capacity (97hm and Huhm) were constructed by continually exerting selective pressure on primary HCC cells (MHCC-97H and Huh7). Through performing exosomal miRNA sequencing in HCC cells with different metastatic potentials (MHCC-97H and 97hm), many significantly different miRNA candidates were found. Among these miRNAs, miR-92a-3p was the most abundant miRNA in the exosomes of highly metastatic HCC cells. Exosomal miR92a-3p was also found enriched in the plasma of HCC patient-derived xenograft mice (PDX) model with high-metastatic potential. Exosomal miR-92a-3p promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in recipient cancer cells via targeting PTEN and regulating its downstream Akt/Snail signaling. Furthermore, through mRNA sequencing in HCC cells with different metastatic potentials and predicting potential transcription factors of miR92a-3p, upregulated transcript factors E2F1 and c-Myc were found in high-metastatic HCC cells promote the expression of cellular and exosomal miR-92a-3p in HCC by directly binding the promoter of its host gene, miR17HG. Clinical data showed that a high plasma exosomal miR92a-3p level was correlated with shortened overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating poor prognosis in HCC patients. In conclusion, hepatoma-derived exosomal miR92a-3p plays a critical role in the EMT progression and promoting metastasis by inhibiting PTEN and activating Akt/Snail signaling. Exosomal miR92a-3p is a potential predictive biomarker for HCC metastasis, and this may provoke the development of novel therapeutic and preventing strategies against metastasis of HCC.

32939012	Lymph node metastasis is the major adverse feature for recurrence and death of thyroid cancer patients. To identify lncRNAs involved in thyroid cancer metastasis, we systemically screened differentially expressed lncRNAs in lymph node metastasis, thyroid cancer, and normal tissues via RNAseq. We found that lncRNA SLC26A4-AS1 was continuously, significantly down-regulated in normal tissues, thyroid cancer, and lymph node metastasis specimens. Low SLC26A4-AS1 levels in tissues were significantly associated with poor prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. LncRNA SLC26A4-AS1 markedly inhibited migration, invasion, and metastasis capability of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, SLC26A4-AS1 could simultaneously interact with DDX5 and the E3 ligase TRIM25, which promoting DDX5 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In particular, SLC26A4-AS1 inhibited expression of multiple DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair genes, especially genes coding proteins in the MRE11/RAS50/NBS1 (MRN) complex. Enhanced interaction between DDX5 and transcriptional factor E2F1 due to silencing of SLC26A4-AS1 promoted binding of the DDX5-E2F1 complex at promoters of the MRN genes and, thus, stimulate the MRN/ATM dependent DSB signaling and thyroid cancer metastasis. Our study uncovered new insights into the biology driving thyroid cancer metastasis and highlights potentials of lncRNAs as future therapeutic targets again cancer metastasis.

32963351	Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation is a well-recognized phenotypic change of prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and it ultimately develops into an aggressive subset of this disease. However, the contribution of signaling pathways that lead to metabolic disorders and NE differentiation of prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we identified that ADT induced upregulation of the succinate-CoA ligase GDP-forming beta subunit (SUCLG2), which regulates succinate metabolism and NE differentiation of prostate cancer. We demonstrated a connection that upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling induced SUCLG2 expression in prostate cancer cells. The LIFR is upregulated by nuclear EGFR, which acts as a transcriptional regulator, directly binds to the LIFR promoter, and drives NE differentiation and glycolysis of prostate cancer. LIFR upregulation is associated with SUCLG2, which increased succinate synthesis and enzymatic activities of mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of SUCLG2 suppressed NE differentiation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth in a xenograft model. Analysis of prostate tissue samples showed increased intensity of nuclear EGFR associated with the LIFR and SUCLG2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer tumors. Our study provides a mechanism whereby ADT upregulates EGFR-LIFR signaling that activates SUCLG2, which subsequently stimulates the metabolic changes associated with NE differentiation and aggressive prostate cancer phenotype.

32973333	ERalpha positive breast cancer accounts for 70% of breast malignancies. Compared with ERalpha negative types, ERalpha positive breast cancer could be effective controlled by endocrine therapy. However, more than half of the patients will develop endocrine resistance, making it an important clinical issue for breast cancer therapy. Endocrine resistance might be caused by multiple alternations, including the components of ERalpha signaling, during tumor progression. Thus, it is urgent and necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms that controls ERalpha expression and stability to improve breast cancer therapeutics. In our current study, we identifies that the ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ERalpha and facilitates breast cancer progression. The expression of RNF181 is correlated with ERalpha level in human breast tumors and relates to poor survival in endocrine-treated patients. RNF181 depletion inhibits breast cancer progression in vivo and in vitro, reduces ERalpha protein level and its target gene expression, such as PS2 and GREB1. Unbiased RNA sequencing analysis indicates RNF181 is necessary for ERalpha signature gene expression in whole genomic level. Immuno-precipitation assays indicate that RNF181 associates with ERalpha and promotes its stability possibly via inducing ERalpha K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. In conclusion, our data implicate a non-genomic mechanism by RNF181 via stabilizing ERalpha protein controls ERalpha target gene expression linked to breast cancer progression.	The ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ERalpha and modulates breast cancer progression.	Oncogene
32973332	Snail is a master inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, however, Snail protein is labile and is quickly degraded through the predominate ubiquitination-mediated proteasome pathway. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) can counteract the Snail degradation process to maintain high level of Snail protein in cancer cells. In this study, we screened a cDNA library containing 79 DUBs, and discovered that a panel of DUBs consisting of USP13, USP28, USP29, USP37, OTUD6A, and DUB3 can markedly stabilize Snail protein, with USP29 displaying the strongest activity to prevent Snail degradation. Mechanistically, USP29 enhances the interaction of Snail and SCP1, resulting in simultaneous dephosphorylation and deubiquitination of Snail and thereafter cooperative prevention of Snail degradation. Biologically, ectopic expression of USP29 promotes gastric cancer cell migration, and depletion of Snail abolishes USP29-mediated cell migration; and USP29 can be induced by major EMT and metastatic inducing factors such as TGFbeta, TNFalpha, and hypoxia. More importantly, high expression levels of Snail, USP29, and SCP1 are associated with poor survival and prognosis. Collectively, these data indicate that Snail is a crucial substrate for USP29 to promote cell migration and USP29/SCP1 complex may be new therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancer.	Deubiquitinase USP29 promotes gastric cancer cell migration by cooperating with phosphatase SCP1 to stabilize Snail protein.	Oncogene
32978519	Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Altered long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are playing regulatory roles in physiological and pathogenic processes in cancer. Here, we uncovered a differentially expressed lncRNA called brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1), and elucidated its function and molecular mechanism in the progression and development of glioma. Three fresh tumor tissues from glioma patients and three normal brain tissues from craniocerebral trauma patients were prepared for high-throughput RNA sequencing. Differential RNA transcripts and BCYRN1 were identified by RT-qPCR in glioma samples and controls. CCK-8, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, TUNEL assays, cell migration assays, wound-healing assays, and xenograft model were established to investigate the biological function of BCYRN1 both in vitro and in vivo. Various bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, biotinylated RNA pulldown assays, and rescue experiments were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). 183 lncRNAs were identified with significant dysregulation in glioma and randomly selected differential RNAs were further confirmed by RT-qPCR. Among them, BCYRN1 was the most downregulated lncRNA, and its low expression positively correlated with glioma progression. Functionally, BCYRN1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration in glioma cell lines, whereas BCYRN1 depletion resulted in the opposite way. MiR-619-5p was further confirmed as the direct target of BCYRN1. Mechanistically, miR-619-5p specifically targeted the CUE domain containing protein 2 (CUEDC2), and BCYRN1/miR-619-5p suppressed glioma tumorigenesis by inactivating PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway in a CUEDC2-dependent manner. Overall, our data presented that the reduced expression of BCYRN1 was associated with poor patient outcome in glioma. BCYRN1 functioned as a ceRNA to inhibit glioma progression by sponging miR-619-5p to regulate CUEDC2 expression and PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway. Our results indicated that BCYRN1 exerted tumor suppressor potential and might be a candidate in the diagnosis and treatment of glioma.

33060856	Epigenetic alteration is one of the hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many driver genes are regulated by DNA methylation in CRC. However, the role of DNA methylation regulating lncRNAs remain elusive. Here, we identify that SNHG11 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 11) is upregulated by promotor hypomethylation in CRC and is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. SNHG11 can promote CRC cell migration and metastasis under hypoxia. Interestingly, the DNA-binding motif of SNHG11 is similar to that of HIF-1alpha. In addition, SNHG11-associated genes are enriched with members of the HIF-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Mechanistically, SNHG11 binds to the pVHLrecognition sites on HIF-1alpha, thus blocking the interaction of pVHL with HIF-1alpha and preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, SNHG11 upregulates the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes, i.e., AK4, ENO1, HK2, and Twist1. Notably, SNHG11 can bind to the HRE sites in the promoter of these genes and increase their transcription. In summary, these results identify a SNHG11/ HIF-1alpha axis that plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion and metastasis.	LncRNA SNHG11 facilitates tumor metastasis by interacting with and stabilizing HIF-1alpha.	Oncogene
32989258	While mechanisms for metastasis were extensively studied in cancer cells from patients with detectable tumors, pathways underlying metastatic dissemination from early lesions before primary tumors appear are poorly understood. Her2 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by suppressing p38, but how Her2 downregulates p38 is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in early lesion breast cancer models, Her2 inhibits p38 by inducing Skp2 through Akt-mediated phosphorylation, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Tpl2, a p38 MAP3K. The early disseminating cells are Her2(+)Skp2(high)Tpl2(low)p-p38(low)E-cadherin(low) in the MMTV-Her2 breast cancer model. In human breast carcinoma, high Skp2 and low Tpl2 expression are associated with the Her2(+) status; Tpl2 expression positively correlates with that of activated p38; Skp2 expression negatively correlates with that of Tpl2 and activated p38. Moreover, the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 axis plays a key role in the disseminating phenotypes in early lesion breast cancer cells; inhibition of Tpl2 enhances early dissemination in vivo. These findings identify the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 cascade as a novel mechanism mediating breast cancer early dissemination and a potential target for novel therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination.	Her2 promotes early dissemination of breast cancer by suppressing the p38 pathway through Skp2-mediated proteasomal degradation of Tpl2.	Oncogene
33037408	Metastasis is responsible for the death of most breast cancer patients. Robo1 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor for various cancers including breast cancer. However, it is not well understood how Robo1 expression is regulated during tumorigenesis. In this study, we uncovered that the transmembrane proline rich gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4 (PRRG4) promotes breast cancer metastasis by downregulating Robo1. Analysis of mRNA expression data in The Cancer Genome Atlas and immunohistochemistry assay on breast tumor samples showed that PRRG4 expression was higher in breast tumors than in normal breast tissues. Experiments with PRRG4 knockdown and overexpression revealed that PRRG4 promoted migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and enhanced metastasis in an experimental metastasis model. Mechanistically, we found that PRRG4 via its LPSY and PPPY motifs recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, which induced ubiquitination and degradation of Robo1, thus contributing to migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition, PRRG4 interacted with and enhanced protein tyrosine kinase Src and FAK activation. Overall, our data support a model that PRRG4 via NEDD4 downregulates the Robo1, resulting in the activation of Src and FAK and promoting breast cancer metastasis. PRRG4 may be a novel target for treating metastatic breast cancer.	PRRG4 promotes breast cancer metastasis through the recruitment of NEDD4 and downregulation of Robo1.	Oncogene
33046796	Metastasis is the main reason for high mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis. Here, we report a novel role of SIX homeobox 4 (SIX4), one of the SIX gene family, in promoting HCC metastasis. The elevated expression of SIX4 was positively correlated with loss of tumor encapsulation, microvascular invasion, higher TNM stage, and poor prognosis in human HCC. SIX4 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for the recurrence and survival in HCC patients. Upregulation of SIX4 promoted HCC invasion and metastasis, whereas downregulation of SIX4 decreased HCC invasion and metastasis. SIX4 transactivated Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) and MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) expression through directly binding to their promoters. Knockdown of YAP1 and c-MET inhibited SIX4-medicated HCC metastasis, while the stable overexpression of YAP1 and c-MET reversed the decreased metastasis induced by SIX4 knockdown. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the specific ligand of c-MET, upregulated SIX4 expression through ERK/NF-kappaB pathway. Knockdown of SIX4 significantly decreased HGF-enhanced HCC metastasis. In human HCC tissues, SIX4 expression was positively correlated with nuclear YAP1, c-MET and HGF expression. Patients with positive coexpression of SIX4/ nuclear YAP1, SIX4/c-MET or HGF/SIX4 had the poorest prognosis. Moreover, the combination treatment of YAP1 inhibitor Verteporfin and c-MET inhibitor Capmatinib significantly suppressed SIX4-mediated HCC metastasis. In conclusion, SIX4 is a prognostic biomarker in HCC patients and targeting the HGF-SIX4-c-MET positive feedback loop may provide a promising strategy for the treatment of SIX4-driven HCC metastasis.	SIX4 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through upregulating YAP1 and c-MET.	Oncogene
33051597	Oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) plays a critical role in multiple carcinogenic signal pathways, and its overexpression has been found in various types of cancer; however, the pathophysiological role of OSR1 in breast cancer has not been evaluated. This study aims to elaborate on the role of OSR1 in breast cancer metastasis and the specific regulatory mechanism. Our results showed that OSR1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in both human breast cancer samples and cell lines. Moreover, phosphorylated OSR1 (p-OSR1) was an independent poor prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer. OSR1 upregulation induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells with the increasing metastatic capacity. In contrast, deleting OSR1 in aggressive breast cancer cells inhibited these phenotypes. OSR1 is the critical activator for transcription factors of EMT. Mechanistically, we found that OSR1 can directly interact and phosphorylate the linker region of Smad2 at Thr220 and Smad3 at Thr179. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 translocated into the nucleus to enhance transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) autocrine signalling and increase the transcription of EMT regulators. Importantly, interruption of the OSR1-Smad2/3-TGF-beta1 signalling axis elicited a robust anti-EMT and anti-metastatic effect in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that OSR1-mediated Smad2/3-TGF-beta1 signalling promotes EMT and metastasis representing a promising therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.	OSR1 phosphorylates the Smad2/3 linker region and induces TGF-beta1 autocrine to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer.	Oncogene
33082558	Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndrome, characterized by tumor development in multiple organs, including renal angiomyolipoma. Biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 is a known genetic driver of angiomyolipoma development, however, whether an altered transcriptional repertoire contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis is unknown. RNA-seq analyses showed that MITF A isoform (MITF-A) was consistently highly expressed in angiomyolipoma, immunohistochemistry showed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor nuclear localization, and Chromatin immuno-Precipitation Sequencing analysis showed that the MITF-A transcriptional start site was highly enriched with H3K27ac marks. Using the angiomyolipoma cell line 621-101, MITF knockout (MITF.KO) and MITF-A overexpressing (MITF.OE) cell lines were generated. MITF.KO cells showed markedly reduced growth and invasion in vitro, and were unable to form xenografted tumors. In contrast, MITF.OE cells grew faster in vitro and as xenografted tumors compared to control cells. RNA-Seq analysis showed that both ID2 and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) expression levels were increased in the MITF.OE cells and reduced in the MITF.KO cells, and luciferase assays showed this was due to transcriptional effects. Importantly, CYR61 overexpression rescued MITF.KO cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that MITF-A is a transcriptional oncogenic driver of angiomyolipoma tumor development, acting through regulation of CYR61.

33122828	microRNAs (miRNAs) can be delivered to tumor cells where they exert their function via mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes. This study investigated exosomal transfer of miR-139-5p to bladder cancer cells and their role in the regulation of tumorigenesis. The dysregulation of polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) in bladder cancer was characterized by RNA quantification, and its functional significance in bladder cancer cells was identified by loss-of-function experiments. We predicted the miR-139-5p that could play a role in regulating PRC1, which was further verified using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Next, we altered the expression of miR-139-5p and PRC1 in bladder cancer cells to identify their functions in cancer progression. Bladder cancer cells were co-cultured with exosomes isolated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) over-expressing miR-139-5p. The intercellular transfer of miR-139-5p along with in vitro and in vivo functions was determined using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Our results revealed that PRC1 levels were increased in bladder cancer tissues and cells, and silencing PRC1 appeared to impede the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion potentials. In addition, miR-139-5p was observed to be down-regulated in bladder cancer, which targeted PRC1 and reduced its expression, hereby resulting in ameliorated tumorigenic characteristics of bladder cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we noted that miR-139-5p from hUCMSCs-derived exosomes could be transferred into bladder cancer cells to down-regulate the PRC1 expression. Moreover, hUCMSCs-derived exosomal miR-139-5p conferred a suppressive role on bladder cancer development in vitro and in vivo. These data together supported the tumor-inhibiting role of MSCs-derived exosomal miR-139-5p in bladder cancer, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy.

33122826	Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers in humans. While it thrives in a state of malnutrition, the mechanism by which pancreatic cancer cells adapt to metabolic stress through metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here, we showed that UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer patient samples compared to the levels in adjacent normal tissues. Levels of UBR5 were closely related to a malignant phenotype and shorter survival among pancreatic cancer patients. Multivariate analyses also revealed that UBR5 overexpression was an independent predictor of poor outcomes among patients with pancreatic cancer. Functional assays revealed that UBR5 contributes to the growth of pancreatic cancer cells by inducing aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UBR5 knockdown increased levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), an important negative regulator in the process of aerobic glycolysis in many cancers. We found a significant negative correlation between levels of UBR5 and FBP1, further demonstrating that UBR5-induced aerobic glycolysis is dependent on FBP1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, UBR5 regulates FBP1 expression by modulating C/EBPalpha, directly binding to C/EBPalpha, and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these results identify a mechanism used by pancreatic cancer cells to survive the nutrient-poor tumour microenvironment and also provide insight regarding the role of UBR5 in pancreatic cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stresses.

33122827	Long noncoding RNAs have been identified as key regulators in the progression of various cancers. LINC00261 has been reported as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. However, its function and underlying mechanisms in pancreatic cancer remain largely unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect RNA expression. In situ hybridization was used to discover the subcellular location. The direct binding of LINC00261 to miR-222-3p was verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. LINC00261-binding proteins were detected using an RNA pulldown assay. LINC00261 was downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. Its reduced expression was correlated with advanced pathological stage and poor prognosis. Forced expression of LINC00261 suppressed pancreatic cancer glycolysis and proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, downregulation of LINC00261 was caused by hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region and EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Moreover, LINC00261 exerted its biological function by binding to miR-222-3p to activate the HIPK2/ERK/c-myc pathway. In addition, LINC00261 could also reduce c-myc expression by sequestering IGF2BP1. Our study suggests that LINC00261 functions as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and identifies novel epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of LINC00261, which contribute to the targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer.

33122824	Overexpression of D-type cyclins in human cancer frequently occurs as a result of protein stabilization, emphasizing the importance of identification of the machinery that regulates their ubiqutin-dependent degradation. Cyclin D3 is overexpressed in ~50% of Burkitt's lymphoma correlating with a mutation of Thr-283. However, the E3 ligase that regulates phosphorylated cyclin D3 and whether a stabilized, phosphorylation deficient mutant of cyclin D3, has oncogenic activity are undefined. We describe the identification of SCF-Fbxl8 as the E3 ligase for Thr-283 phosphorylated cyclin D3. SCF-Fbxl8 poly-ubiquitylates p-Thr-283 cyclin D3 targeting it to the proteasome. Functional investigation demonstrates that Fbxl8 antagonizes cell cycle progression, hematopoietic cell proliferation, and oncogene-induced transformation through degradation of cyclin D3, which is abolished by expression of cyclin D3T283A, a non-phosphorylatable mutant. Clinically, the expression of cyclin D3 is inversely correlated with the expression of Fbxl8 in lymphomas from human patients implicating Fbxl8 functions as a tumor suppressor.

33128042	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified breast cancers are treated using targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors, but resistance to these therapies leads to systemic tumor recurrence of metastatic disease. Herein, we conducted gene expression analyses of HER2 kinase inhibitor-resistant cell lines as compared to their drug-sensitive counterparts. These data demonstrate the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which included enhanced expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and axonal guidance molecules known as neuropilins (NRPs). Immunoprecipitation of FGFR1 coupled with mass spectroscopy indicated that FGFR1 forms a physical complex with NRPs, which is enhanced upon induction of EMT. Confocal imaging revealed that FGFR1 and NRP1 predominantly interact throughout the cytoplasm. Along these lines, short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of NRP1, but not the use of NRP1-blocking antibodies, inhibited FGFR signaling and reduced tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results further indicate that NRP1 upregulation during EMT is mediated via binding of the chromatin reader protein, bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) in the NRP1 proximal promoter region. Pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 decreased NRP1 expression and ablated FGF-mediated tumor cell growth. Overall, our studies indicate that NRPs facilitate aberrant growth factor signaling during EMT-associated drug resistance and metastasis. Pharmacological combination of epigenetic modulators with FGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors may provide improved outcomes for breast cancer patients with drug-resistant metastatic disease.

33188296	PARK7 is involved in many key cellular processes, including cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, oxidative stress protection, and mitochondrial function maintenance. Deregulation of PARK7 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. Here, we aimed to clarify the effect of PARK7 on stemness and radioresistance of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Serum differentiation and magnetic cell sorting of GSCs revealed that PARK7 was preferentially expressed in GSCs rather than differentiated GSCs. Immunohistochemical staining showed enhanced expression of PARK7 in glioma tissues compared to that in normal brain tissues. shRNA-mediated knockdown of PARK7 inhibited the self-renewal activity of GSCs in vitro, as evidenced by the results of neurosphere formation, limiting dilution, and soft-agar clonogenic assays. In addition, PARK7 knockdown suppressed GSC invasion and enhanced GSC sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). PARK7 knockdown suppressed expression of GSC signatures including nestin, epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), SOX2, NOTCH1, and OCT4. Contrarily, overexpression of PARK7 in CD133(-) non-GSCs increased self-renewal activities, migration, and IR resistance, and rescued the reduction of GSC factors under shPARK7-transfected and serum-differentiation conditions. Intriguingly, PARK7 acted as a co-chaperone of HSP90 by binding to it, protecting EGFRvIII from proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of PARK7 increased the production of reactive oxygen species, inducing partial apoptosis and enhancing IR sensitivity in GSCs. Finally, PARK7 knockdown increased mouse survival and IR sensitivity in vivo. Based on these data, we propose that PARK7 plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of stemness and therapeutic resistance in GSCs.

33188295	Cadherins form a large and pleiotropic superfamily of membranous proteins sharing Ca(2+)-binding repeats. While the importance of classic cadherins such as E- or N-cadherin for tumorigenesis is acknowledged, there is much less information about other cadherins that are merely considered as tissue-specific adhesion molecules. Here, we focused on the atypical cadherin MUCDHL that stood out for its unusual features and unique function in the gut. Analyses of transcriptomic data sets (n > 250) established that MUCDHL mRNA levels are down-regulated in colorectal tumors. Importantly, the decrease of MUCDHL expression is more pronounced in the worst-prognosis subset of tumors and is associated with decreased survival. Molecular characterization of the tumors indicated a negative correlation with proliferation-related processes (e.g., nucleic acid metabolism, DNA replication). Functional genomic studies showed that the loss of MUCDHL enhanced tumor incidence and burden in intestinal tumor-prone mice. Extensive structure/function analyses revealed that the mode of action of MUCDHL goes beyond membrane sequestration of ss-catenin and targets through its extracellular domain key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, AKT). Beyond MUCDHL, this study illustrates how the loss of a gene critical for the morphological and functional features of mature cells contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating oncogenic pathways.	The atypical cadherin MUCDHL antagonizes colon cancer formation and inhibits oncogenic signaling through multiple mechanisms.	Oncogene
33199826	A subset of human prostate cancer exhibits increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids, but the molecular driver(s) of this metabolic abnormality remains obscure. This study demonstrates a novel metabolic function of c-Myc (Myc) in regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The role of Myc in regulation of fatty acid synthesis was investigated by: (a) interrogation of the prostate cancer The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, (b) chromatin immunoprecipitation, and (c) determination of the expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and targeted metabolomics using a mouse model and human specimens. The expression of MYC was positively associated with that of key fatty acid synthesis genes including ACLY, ACC1, and FASN in prostate cancer TCGA dataset. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed Myc occupancy at the promoters of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN. Prostate-specific overexpression of Myc in Hi-Myc transgenic mice resulted in overexpression of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN proteins in neoplastic lesions and increased circulating levels of total free fatty acids. Targeted metabolomics confirmed increased circulating levels of individual fatty acids in the plasma of Hi-Myc mice and human subjects when compared to corresponding controls. Immunohistochemistry also revealed a positive and statistically significant association in expression of Myc with that of ACC1 in human prostate adenocarcinoma specimens. We propose that Myc-regulated fatty acid synthesis is a valid target for therapy and/or prevention of prostate cancer.

33219317	The key component in the UFM1 conjugation system, UFM1-binding and PCI domain-containing protein 1 (UFBP1), regulates many biological processes. Recently it has been shown that low UFBP1 protein level is associated with the worse outcome of gastric cancer patients. However, how it responses to the sensitivity of gastric cancer to chemotherapy drugs and the underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive. Here, we discovered that high UFBP1 expression increases the progression-free survival of advanced gastric cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Cell-line based studies unveiled that UFBP1 expression enhances while UFBP1 knockdown attenuates the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin. High-throughput SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the protein level of aldo-keto reductase 1Cs (AKR1Cs) is significantly downregulated by UFBP1. Flow cytometry analysis showed that UFBP1 expression increases while UFBP1 knockdown reduces reactive oxygen species upon cisplatin treatment. We further disclosed that UFBP1 attenuates the gene expression of AKR1Cs and the transcription activity of the master oxidative stress-response transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2). Detailed mechanistic studies manifested that UFBP1 promotes the formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on Nrf2 and thus augments its proteasome-mediated degradation. Experiments using genetic depletion and pharmacological activation in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that UFBP1 enhances the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin through the Nrf2/AKR1C axis. Overall, this work discovered a novel prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism, which may benefit to future personalized chemotherapy.

33230243	Despite significant progression in the study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the role of the proteasome in regulating cross talk between mTOR signaling and glycolysis in liver cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of REGgamma, a proteasome activator, in mice significantly attenuates DEN-induced liver tumor formation. Ablation of REGgamma increases the stability of PP2Ac (protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit) in vitro and in vivo, which dephosphorylates PRAS40 (AKT1 substrate 1) and stabilizes the interaction between PRAS40 and Raptor to inactive mTORC1-mediated hyper-glycolytic metabolism. In the DEN-induced animal model and clinical hepato-carcinoma samples, high levels of REGgamma in HCC tumor regions contribute to reduced expression of PP2Ac, leading to accumulation of phosphorylated PRAS40 and mTORC1-mediated activation of HIF1alpha. Interestingly, mTORC1 enhances REGgamma activity in HCC, forming a positive feedback regulatory loop. In conclusion, our study identifies REGgamma-PP2Ac-PRAS40 axis as a new layer in regulating mTORC1 activity and downstream glycolytic alterations during HCC development, highlighting the REGgamma-proteasome as a potential target for personalized HCC therapy.

33239755	Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a type of highly aggressive pediatric tumor in bones and soft tissues and its metastatic spread remains the most powerful predictor of poor outcome. We previously identified that the transcription factor hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) promotes ES tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying ES metastasis remain unclear. Here, we show that HDGF drives ES metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and HDGF reduces metastasis-free survival (MFS) in two independent large cohorts of human ES patients. Integrative analyses of HDGF ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling in ES cells reveal that HDGF regulates multiple metastasis-associated genes, among which activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) emerges as a major HDGF target and a novel metastasis-suppressor in ES. HDGF down-regulates ALCAM, induces expression and activation of the downstream effectors Rho-GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42, and promotes actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell-matrix adhesion. In addition, repression of ALCAM and activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for the pro-metastatic functions of HDGF in vitro. Moreover, analyses in murine models with ES tumor orthotopic implantation and experimental metastasis, as well as in human ES samples, demonstrate the associations among HDGF, ALCAM, and GTPases expression levels. Furthermore, high HDGF/low ALCAM expression define a subgroup of patients harboring the worst MFS. These findings suggest that the HDGF/ALCAM/GTPases axis represents a promising therapeutic target for limiting ES metastasis.

33262463	Metastasis remains the major obstacle to improved survival for breast cancer patients. Downregulation of FOXO3a transcription factor in breast cancer is causally associated with the development of metastasis through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report that FOXO3a is functionally related to the inhibition of VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and to the consequent suppression of breast cancer metastasis. We show that FOXO3a directly induces miR-29b-2 and miR-338 expression. Ectopic expression of miR-29b-2/miR-338 significantly suppresses EMT, migration/invasion, and in vivo metastasis of breast cancer. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-29b-2 directly targets VEGF-A while miR-338 directly targets NRP1, and show that regulation of miR-29b-2 and miR-338 mediates the ability of FOXO3a to suppress VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and breast cancer metastasis. Clinically, our results show that the FOXO3a-miR-29b-2/miR-338-VEGF-A/NRP1 axis is dysregulated and plays a critical role in disease progression in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings propose that FOXO3a functions as a metastasis suppressor, and define a novel signaling axis of FOXO3a-miRNA-VEGF-A/NRP1 in breast cancer, which might be potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

33273726	Trastuzumab resistance has been becoming a major obstacle for treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer patients. Increasing evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play critical roles during the formation of drug resistance, however, the underlying mechanism is not well known. In this study, mass spectrometry, RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify the direct interactions among AGAP2-AS1 and other associated targets, such as human antigen R (HuR), miR-15a-5p, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). In vitro and in vivo experimental assays were done to clarify the functional role of AGAP2-AS1 in trastuzumab resistance, stemness, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). The results showed that MSC co-culture induced trastuzumab resistance. AGAP2-AS1 was upregulated in MSC-cultured cells, and knockdown of AGAP2-AS1 reversed the MSC-mediated trastuzumab resistance. Furthermore, MSC culture-induced AGAP2-AS1 regulates stemness and trastuzumab resistance via activating FAO. Mechanistically, AGAP2-AS1 is associated with HuR, and the AGAP2-AS1-HuR complex could directly bind to the CPT1, increasing its expression via improving RNA stability. In addition, AGAP2-AS1 could serve as ceRNA via sponging miR-15a-5p and releasing CPT1 mRNA. Clinically, increased expression of serum AGAP2-AS1 predicts poor response to trastuzumab treatment in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, MSC culture-induced AGAP2-AS1 caused stemness and trastuzumab resistance via promoting CPT1 expression and inducing FAO. Our results provide new insight of the role of MSCs in trastuzumab resistance and AGAP2-AS1 could be promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for HER-2+ breast cancer patients.

33311552	Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly invasive and metastatic skin cancer. While high expression of miR-375 is a characteristic of MCC, it seems not to contribute to the malignant phenotype of MCC cells. miR-375 enrichment in MCC-derived extracellular vesicles suggests its intercellular signaling function. Here, we demonstrate that horizontally transferred miR-375 causes fibroblast polarization toward cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The polarization is evidenced by phenotypic changes and induction of alpha-SMA, CXCL2, and IL-1beta. Fibroblast polarization is inhibited by specific antagomirs and mimicked by experimental miR-375 expression. Mechanistically, miR-375 downregulates RBPJ and p53, two key players regulating fibroblast polarization. In clinical MCC samples, in situ hybridization located miR-375 in CAFs, which correlated with high alpha-SMA protein and low RBPJ and TP53 expression; single-cell RNAseq revealed a disparate fibroblast polarization negatively correlating with p53 pathway-related gene expression. Thus, the functional role of miR-375 in MCC is to generate a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment by inducing fibroblast polarization.

33323968	Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in men. The major cause of death in prostate cancer patients can be attributed to metastatic spread of disease or tumor recurrence after initial treatment. Prostate tumors are known to remain undetected or dormant for a long period of time before they progress locoregionally or at distant sites as overt tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of dormancy is yet poorly understood. In this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis and identified a gene, Regucalcin (RGN), which promotes dormancy of prostate cancer. We found that cancer patients expressing higher level of RGN showed significantly longer recurrence-free and overall- survival. Using a doxycycline-inducible RGN expression system, we showed that ectopic expression of RGN in prostate tumor cells induced dormancy in vivo, while following suppression of RGN triggered recurrence of tumor growth. On the other hand, silencing RGN in LNCap cells promoted its outgrowth in the tibia of mice. Importantly, RGN promoted multiple known hallmarks of tumor dormancy including activation of p38 MAPK, decrease in Erk signaling and inhibition of FOXM1 expression. Furthermore, we found that RGN significantly suppressed angiogenesis by increasing secretory miR-23c level in the exosomes. Intriguingly, FOXM1 was found to negatively regulate miR-23c expression in prostate cancer. In addition, we identified 11 RGN downstream target genes that independently predicted longer recurrence-free survival in patients. We found that expression of these genes was regulated by FOXM1 and/or p38 MAPK. These findings suggest a critical role of RGN in prostate cancer dormancy, and the utility of RGN signaling and exosomal miR-23c as biomarkers for predicting recurrence.

33323973	Dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critically involved in gastric cancer (GC) progression. However, current Wnt pathway inhibitors being studied in preclinical or clinical settings for other cancers such as colorectal and pancreatic cancers are either too cytotoxic or insufficiently efficacious for GC. Thus, we screened new potent targets from beta-catenin destruction complex associated with GC progression from clinical samples, and found that scaffolding protein RACK1 deficiency plays a significant role in GC progression, but not APC, AXIN, and GSK3beta. Then, we identified its upstream regulator UBE2T which promotes GC progression via hyperactivating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through the ubiquitination and degradation of RACK1 at the lysine K172, K225, and K257 residues independent of an E3 ligase. Indeed, UBE2T protein level is negatively associated with prognosis in GC patients, suggesting that UBE2T is a promising target for GC therapy. Furthermore, we identified a novel UBE2T inhibitor, M435-1279, and suggested that M435-1279 acts inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway hyperactivation through blocking UBE2T-mediated degradation of RACK1, resulting in suppression of GC progression with lower cytotoxicity in the meantime. Overall, we found that increased UBE2T levels promote GC progression via the ubiquitination of RACK1 and identified a novel potent inhibitor providing a balance between growth inhibition and cytotoxicity as well, which offer a new opportunity for the specific GC patients with aberrant Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.	A novel UBE2T inhibitor suppresses Wnt/beta-catenin signaling hyperactivation and gastric cancer progression by blocking RACK1 ubiquitination.	Oncogene
33323971	The mutagenic APOBEC3B (A3B) cytosine deaminase is frequently over-expressed in cancer and promotes tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that underlie A3B over-expression is important, especially for developing therapeutic approaches to reducing A3B levels, and consequently limiting cancer mutagenesis. We previously demonstrated that A3B is repressed by p53 and p53 mutation increases A3B expression. Here, we investigate A3B expression upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that activate p53, including 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and cisplatin. Contrary to expectation, these drugs induced A3B expression and concomitant cellular cytosine deaminase activity. A3B induction was p53-independent, as chemotherapy drugs stimulated A3B expression in p53 mutant cells. These drugs commonly activate ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs. Using specific inhibitors and gene knockdowns, we show that activation of DNA-PKcs and ATM by chemotherapeutic drugs promotes NF-kappaB activity, with consequent recruitment of NF-kappaB to the A3B gene promoter to drive A3B expression. Further, we find that A3B knockdown re-sensitises resistant cells to cisplatin, and A3B knockout enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Our data highlight a role for A3B in resistance to chemotherapy and indicate that stimulation of A3B expression by activation of DNA repair and NF-kappaB pathways could promote cancer mutations and expedite chemoresistance.	Induction of APOBEC3B expression by chemotherapy drugs is mediated by DNA-PK-directed activation of NF-kappaB.	Oncogene
33323974	Metastatic melanoma is hallmarked by its ability of phenotype switching to more slowly proliferating, but highly invasive cells. Here, we tested the impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on melanoma progression in association with melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) expression levels. We established a mouse melanoma model for deleting Stat3 in melanocytes with specific expression of human hyperactive NRAS(Q61K) in an Ink4a-deficient background, two frequent driver mutations in human melanoma. Mice devoid of Stat3 showed early disease onset with higher proliferation in primary tumors, but displayed significantly diminished lung, brain, and liver metastases. Whole-genome expression profiling of tumor-derived cells also showed a reduced invasion phenotype, which was further corroborated by 3D melanoma model analysis. Notably, loss or knockdown of STAT3 in mouse or human cells resulted in the upregulation of MITF and induction of cell proliferation. Mechanistically we show that STAT3-induced CAAT Box Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) expression was sufficient to suppress MITF transcription. Epigenetic analysis by ATAC-seq confirmed that CEBPa/b binding to the MITF enhancer region silenced the MITF locus. Finally, by classification of patient-derived melanoma samples, we show that STAT3 and MITF act antagonistically and hence contribute differentially to melanoma progression. We conclude that STAT3 is a driver of the metastatic process in melanoma and able to antagonize MITF via direct induction of CEBP family member transcription.	STAT3 promotes melanoma metastasis by CEBP-induced repression of the MITF pathway.	Oncogene
33420361	Myeloma cells produce excessive levels of dickkopf-1 (DKK1), which mediates the inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, leading to multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying DKK1 overexpression in myeloma remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide evidence that hypoxia promotes DKK1 expression in myeloma cells. Under hypoxic conditions, p38 kinase phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and drove its nuclear import to activate DKK1 transcription. In addition, high levels of DKK1 were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions in patients with t(4;14) MM, overexpressing the histone methyltransferase MMSET, which was identified as a downstream target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. Furthermore, we found that CREB could recruit MMSET, leading to the stabilization of HIF-1alpha protein and the increased dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 on the DKK1 promoter. Knockdown of CREB in myeloma cells alleviated the suppression of osteoblastogenesis by myeloma-secreted DKK1 in vitro. Combined treatment with a CREB inhibitor and the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 (evofosfamide) significantly reduced MM-induced bone destruction in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal that hypoxia and a cytogenetic abnormality regulate DKK1 expression in myeloma cells, and provide an additional rationale for the development of therapeutic strategies that interrupt DKK1 to cure MM.	Hypoxia-induced CREB cooperates MMSET to modify chromatin and promote DKK1 expression in multiple myeloma.	Oncogene
33420362	Distant metastasis is the leading cause of treatment failure in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (LZTS2) is downregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LZTS2 associates with p85 to inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and impairs HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identify LZTS2 as a bona fide substrate of the E3 ligase beta-Trcp and protein kinase CK1delta, which are responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of LZTS2. Importantly, we show that the beta-Trcp and CK1delta-mediated degradation of LZTS2 promotes HCC progression and metastasis by activating PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, our study not only illustrates the roles of LZTS2 in regulating HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis but also reveals a novel posttranslational modification of LZTS2 by beta-Trcp and CK1delta, indicating that the beta-Trcp/CK1delta/LZTS2/PI3K axis may be a novel oncogenic driver involved in HCC progression and metastasis.	beta-Trcp and CK1delta-mediated degradation of LZTS2 activates PI3K/AKT signaling to drive tumorigenesis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.

33420373	Current evidence indicates that resistance to the tyrosine kinase-type cell surface receptor (HER2)-targeted therapies is frequently associated with HER3 and active signaling via HER2-HER3 dimers, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Thus, understanding the response to HER2-HER3 signaling and the regulation of the dimer is essential to decipher therapy relapse mechanisms. Here, we investigate a bidirectional relationship between HER2-HER3 signaling and a type-1 transmembrane sorting receptor, sortilin-related receptor (SorLA; SORL1). We demonstrate that heregulin-mediated signaling supports SorLA transcription downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that SorLA interacts directly with HER3, forming a trimeric complex with HER2 and HER3 to attenuate lysosomal degradation of the dimer in a Ras-related protein Rab4-dependent manner. In line with a role for SorLA in supporting the stability of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, loss of SorLA compromised heregulin-induced cell proliferation and sensitized metastatic anti-HER2 therapy-resistant breast cancer cells to neratinib in cancer spheroids in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish brain xenograft model.

33420368	Steroid regulated cancer cells use nuclear receptors and associated regulatory proteins to orchestrate transcriptional networks to drive disease progression. In primary breast cancer, the coactivator AIB1 promotes estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity to enhance cell proliferation. The function of the coactivator in ER(+) metastasis however is not established. Here we describe AIB1 as a survival factor, regulator of pro-metastatic transcriptional pathways and a promising actionable target. Genomic alterations and functional expression of AIB1 associated with reduced disease-free survival in patients and enhanced metastatic capacity in novel CDX and PDX ex-vivo models of ER(+) metastatic disease. Comparative analysis of the AIB1 interactome with complementary RNAseq characterized AIB1 as a transcriptional repressor. Specifically, we report that AIB1 interacts with MTA2 to form a repressive complex, inhibiting CDH1 (encoding E-cadherin) to promote EMT and drive progression. We further report that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of AIB1 demonstrates significant anti-proliferative activity in patient-derived models establishing AIB1 as a viable strategy to target endocrine resistant metastasis. This work defines a novel role for AIB1 in the regulation of EMT through transcriptional repression in advanced cancer cells with a considerable implication for prognosis and therapeutic interventions.

33420365	Perineural invasion (PNI), a pathologic feature defined as cancer cell invasion in, around, and through nerves, is an indicator of poor prognosis and survival in prostate cancer (PC). Despite widespread recognition of the clinical significance of PNI, the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a clinically and functionally important mediator of PNI in PC. MAOA promotes PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor innervation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Mechanistically, MAOA activates SEMA3C in a Twist1-dependent transcriptional manner, which in turn stimulates cMET to facilitate PNI via autocrine or paracrine interaction with coactivated PlexinA2 and NRP1. Furthermore, MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively reduces PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor-infiltrating nerve fiber density along with suppressed xenograft tumor growth and progression in mice. Collectively, these findings characterize the contribution of MAOA to the pathogenesis of PNI and provide a rationale for using MAOA inhibitors as a targeted treatment for PNI in PC.

33452454	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or glioblastoma is the most deadly malignant brain tumor in adults. GBM is difficult to treat mainly due to the presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) has been linked to stemness and malignancy of GSCs; however, the regulatory mechanism of EGFRvIII is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that Anoctamin-1 (ANO1), a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel, interacts with EGFRvIII, increases its protein stability, and supports the maintenance of stemness and tumor progression in GSCs. Specifically, shRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of ANO1 suppressed the self-renewal, invasion activities, and expression of EGFRvIII and related stem cell factors, including NOTCH1, nestin, and SOX2 in GSCs. Conversely, ANO1 overexpression enhanced the above phenomena. Mechanistically, ANO1 protected EGFRvIII from proteasomal degradation by directly binding to it. ANO1 knockdown significantly increased survival in mice and strongly suppressed local invasion of GSCs in an in vivo intracranial mouse model. Collectively, these results suggest that ANO1 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of stemness and invasiveness of GSCs by regulating the expression of EGFRvIII and related signaling molecules, and can be considered a promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.

33452458	Aberrant Notch activation has been implicated in multiple malignancies and the identification of NOTCH receptors and related pathways is critical for targeted therapy. In this study, we aim to delineate the most prominent dysregulated NOTCH receptor and comprehensively reveal its deregulation in gastric cancer (GC). In the four Notch members, NOTCH3 was found uniformly upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes in multiple GC datasets. siRNA-mediated NOTCH3 knockdown demonstrated antitumor effects by suppressing cell proliferation, inhibiting monolayer formation, and impairing cell invasion abilities. Its depletion also induced early and late apoptosis. NOTCH3 was confirmed to be a direct target of two tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-491-5p and miR-875-5p. The activation of NOTCH3 is partly due to the silence of these two miRNAs. Through RNA-seq profiling and functional validation, PHLDB2 was identified as a potent functional downstream modulator for NOTCH3 in gastric carcinogenesis. PHLDB2 expression demonstrated a positive correlation with NOTCH3, but was negatively correlated with miR-491-5p. Akt-mTOR was revealed as the downstream signaling of PHLDB2. The NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt co-activation was found in 33.7% GC patients and the activation of this axis predicted poor clinical outcome. GC cells treated with siNOTCH3, siPHLDB2, miR-491-5p, miR-875-5p, were more sensitive to Cisplatin and 5-FU. Taken together, the NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt cascade plays oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis and serves as a therapeutic target. Our study provided insights into Notch-mediated underlying molecular mechanisms and implied translational potential.

33452459	KNSTRN is a component of the mitotic spindle, which was rarely investigated in tumorigenesis. AKT plays an essential role in tumorigenesis by modulating the phosphorylation of various substrates. The activation of AKT is regulated by PTEN and PIP3. Here, we prove KNSTRN is positively correlated with malignancy of bladder cancer and KNSTRN activates AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. More importantly, our study reveals that both KNSTRN and PTEN interact with PH domain of AKT at cell membrane. The amount of KNSTRN interacted with AKT is negatively related to PTEN. Furthermore, PIP3 pull-down assay proves that KNSTRN promoted AKT movement to PIP3. These data suggest KNSTRN may activate AKT phosphorylation by promoting AKT movement to PIP3 and alleviating PTEN suppression. Based on the activation of AKT phosphorylation, our study demonstrates that KNSTRN promotes bladder cancer metastasis and gemcitabine resistance in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the effect of KNSTRN on tumorigenesis and gemcitabine resistance could be restored by AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 or AKT overexpression. In conclusion, we identify an oncogene KNSTRN that promotes tumorigenesis and gemcitabine resistance by activating AKT phosphorylation and may serve as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer.

33531626	The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) plays a key role in cancer progression and is tightly regulated by the proteasome pathway. E3 ligases that mediate NRF2 ubiquitination have been widely reported, but the mechanism of NRF2 deubiquitination remains largely unclear. Here, we identified ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 11 (USP11) in NRF2 complexes and confirmed an interaction between these two proteins. We further found that USP11 deubiquitinates NRF2; this modification stabilizes NRF2. Functionally, USP11 depletion contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of ferroptotic cell death due to ROS-mediated stress, which can be largely abrogated by overexpression of NRF2. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of USP11 and NRF2 was performed using a lung tissue microarray, which revealed that USP11 is highly expressed in patients with NSCLC and positively correlated with NRF2 expression. Together, USP11 stabilizes NRF2 and is thus an important player in cell proliferation and ferroptosis.

33536579	Brian metastasis, which is diagnosed in 30% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with metastasis, causes poor survival outcomes. Growing evidence has characterized miRNAs involving in breast cancer brain metastasis; however, currently, there is a lack of prognostic plasma-based indicator for brain metastasis. In this study, high level of miR-211 can act as brain metastatic prognostic marker in vivo. High miR-211 drives early and specific brain colonization through enhancing trans-blood-brain barrier (BBB) migration, BBB adherence, and stemness properties of tumor cells and causes poor survival in vivo. SOX11 and NGN2 are the downstream targets of miR-211 and negatively regulate miR-211-mediated TNBC brain metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, high miR-211 is correlated with poor survival and brain metastasis in TNBC patients. Our findings suggest that miR-211 may be used as an indicator for TNBC brain metastasis.

33564074	Metastasis is the fundamental cause of cancer mortality, but there are still very few anti-metastatic drugs available. Endosomal trafficking has been implicated in tumor metastasis, and we have previously found that small chemical vacuolin-1 (V1) potently inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and general endosomal-lysosomal degradation. Here, we assessed the anti-metastatic activity of V1 both in vitro and in vivo. V1 significantly inhibits colony formation, migration, and invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. It also compromises the assembly-disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions (FAs) by inhibiting the recycling and degradation of integrins. In various experimental or transgenic mouse models, V1 significantly suppresses the metastasis and/or tumor growth of breast cancer or melanoma. We further identified capping protein Zbeta (CapZbeta) as a V1 binding protein and showed that it is required for the V1-mediated inhibition of migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that V1 targets CapZbeta to inhibit endosomal trafficking and metastasis.	Vacuolin-1 inhibits endosomal trafficking and metastasis via CapZbeta.	Oncogene
33603165	Reversible phosphorylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating 26S proteasome function in health and disease. Over 100 phospho-tyrosine sites of the human proteasome have been detected, and yet their function and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the 19S subunit Rpt2 is phosphorylated at Tyr439, a strictly conserved residue within the C-terminal HbYX motif of Rpt2 that is essential for 26S proteasome assembly. Unexpectedly, we found that Y439 phosphorylation depends on Rpt2 membrane localization mediated by its N-myristoylation. Multiple receptors tyrosine kinases can trigger Rpt2-Y439 phosphorylation by activating Src, a N-myristoylated tyrosine kinase. Src directly phosphorylates Rpt2-Y439 in vitro and negatively regulates 26S proteasome activity at cellular membranes, which can be reversed by the membrane-associated isoform of protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2). In H1975 lung cancer cells with activated Src, blocking Rpt2-Y439 phosphorylation by the Y439F mutation conferred partial resistance to the Src inhibitor saracatinib both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model, and caused significant changes of cellular responses to saracatinib at the proteome level. Our study has defined a novel mechanism involved in the spatial regulation of proteasome function and provided new insights into tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based anticancer therapies.

33603170	Smoking is one of the most impactful lifestyle-related risk factors in many cancer types including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). As the major component of tobacco and e-cigarettes, nicotine is not only responsible for addiction to smoking but also a carcinogen. Here we report that nicotine enhances ESCC cancer malignancy and tumor-initiating capacity by interacting with cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7 subunit (CHRNA7) and subsequently activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. We found that aberrant CHRNA7 expression can serve as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In multiple ESCC mouse models, dextromethorphan and metformin synergistically repressed nicotine-enhanced cancer-initiating cells (CIC) properties and inhibited ESCC progression. Mechanistically, dextromethorphan non-competitively inhibited nicotine binding to CHRNA7 while metformin downregulated CHRNA7 expression by antagonizing nicotine-induced promoter DNA hypomethylation of CHRNA7. Since dextromethorphan and metformin are two safe FDA-approved drugs with minimal undesirable side-effects, the combination of these drugs has a high potential as either a preventive and/or a therapeutic strategy against nicotine-promoted ESCC and perhaps other nicotine-sensitive cancer types as well.

33627786	Protein ubiquitination is a critical regulator of cellular homeostasis. Aberrations in the addition or removal of ubiquitin can result in the development of cancer and key components of the ubiquitination machinery serve as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. An emerging target in the development of cancer therapeutics are the deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes that remove ubiquitin from protein substrates. Whether this class of enzyme plays a role in cervical cancer has not been fully explored. By interrogating the cervical cancer data from the TCGA consortium, we noted that the DUB USP13 is amplified in ~15% of cervical cancer cases. We confirmed that USP13 expression was increased in cervical cancer cell lines, cytology samples from patients with cervical disease and in cervical cancer tissue. Depletion of USP13 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, USP13 bound to, deubiquitinated and stabilised Mcl-1, a pivotal member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Furthermore, reduced Mcl-1 expression partially contributed to the observed proliferative defect in USP13 depleted cells. Importantly, the expression of USP13 and Mcl-1 proteins correlated in cervical cancer tissue. Finally, we demonstrated that depletion of USP13 expression or inhibition of USP13 enzymatic activity increased the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to the BH3 mimetic inhibitor ABT-263. Together, our data demonstrates that USP13 is a potential oncogene in cervical cancer that functions to stabilise the pro-survival protein Mcl-1, offering a potential therapeutic target for these cancers.

33627781	Cellular heterogeneity and the lack of metastatic biomarkers limit the diagnosis of and development of therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, development of new clinically relevant markers is urgently needed. By using RNA-seq analysis, we found that nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) was highly expressed in metastatic lung clones of MDA-MB-231 cells. This high level of NGFR expression was necessary for TNBC cells to grow into tumor spheres under nonadhesive conditions, resist anoikis, promote primary tumor growth and increase metastasis in mice. NGFR was also expressed at a high level in a greater number of TNBC patients (45%) than non-TNBC patients (23%), enriched in higher grade tumors, and negatively correlated with the overall survival of TNBC patients. Mechanistic analysis indicated that NGFR exerted its prometastatic effects by binding with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (TrkC) mainly through a ligand-independent manner, which activated the MEK-ERK1-ZEB1 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, increased the level of fibronectin, and decreased the expression of PUMA. Notably, we observed that NGFR expression in TrkC-positive metastatic clones reduced cellular sensitivity to anti-Trk therapy. Moreover, WNT family member 5a (WNT5A) and TrkC activated NGFR transcription in a ZEB1-dependent manner. Taken together, this study identified NGFR as a novel driver for transforming TNBC into higher grade metastatic tumors. Our findings provide the basis for the future development of NGFR as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for determining the metastatic potential of TNBC and as a therapeutic target for treating TNBC patients.

33649535	Despite the well-established role of CMTM6 in the stabilization of cell surface PD-L1 in cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying CMTM6 expression and regulation are still largely unknown. Here we unexpectedly find a strikingly positive correlation between CMTM6 and Hu-Antigen R (HuR) expression in most types of cancer. Mechanistically, we elucidate HuR stabilizes CMTM6 mRNA via direct association with AU-rich elements (AREs) in its 3'UTR and predominantly up-regulates CMTM6, which is readily abolished by HuR-specific inhibitor, MS-444. Phenotypically, we notice abundant cell surface PD-L1 in HuR-high cancer cells, which significantly inhibits immune activation of co-cultured T cells as indicated by IL-2 production. Treatment with MS-444 completely relieves immune suppression imposed by HuR-overexpression and further stimulates immune responses. Ectopic HuR accelerates allograft tumor progression in vivo, which is greatly compromised by simultaneous administration with MS-444. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism in control of CMTM6 and therefore PD-L1 expression, and suggests the potential of combining HuR inhibitor with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.

33664453	Type II diabetes (T2D) and specific cancers share many risk factors, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these connections are often not well-understood. BCDIN3D is an RNA modifying enzyme that methylates specific precursor microRNAs and tRNA(His). In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity. We further show that elevated F1,6-BP is due to downregulation of Aldolase C (ALDOC), an enzyme that cleaves F1,6-BP mainly in the brain, but whose high expression/amplification is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. BCDIN3D regulates ALDOC through a non-canonical mechanism involving the crucial let-7 microRNA family and its target site on the 3'UTR of ALDOC. Overall, our results reveal an important connection between BCDIN3D, let-7 and glycolysis that may be relevant to breast cancer, obesity, and T2D.

33664452	Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) is linked to the regulation of gene expression and histone ubiquitylation conformation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. However, the upstream regulators of PRC1 biogenesis machinery remain obscure. Here, we report that the polycomb group-related mammalian gene Mel18 is a target of the protein kinase AKT. AKT phosphorylates Mel18 at T334 to disrupt the interaction between Mel18 and other PRC1 members, leading to attenuated PRC1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H2A at Lys119. As such, PRC1 target genes, many of which are known oncogenes, are derepressed upon T334-Mel18 phosphorylation, which promotes malignant behaviours, including cell proliferation, tumour formation, migration and invasion, bone and brain metastatic lesion formation. Notably, a positive correlation between AKT activity and pT334-Mel18 is observed, and prognostic models based on p-AKT and pT334-Mel18 that predicted overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients are established. These findings have implications for understanding the role of AKT and its associated proteins in chromatin ubiquitylation, and also indicate the AKT-Mel18-H2AK119ub axis as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer patients.

33674746	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasms. Invasion and metastasis are the main causes of GC-related deaths. Recently, kinesins were discovered to be involved in tumor development. The aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of kinesin superfamily protein 26A (KIF26A) in GC and its underlying molecular mechanism in regulating tumor invasion and metastasis. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we showed that KIF26A expression was lower in GC tissues without lymph node metastasis (LNM) than in nontumorous gastric mucosa, and even lower in GC tissues with LNM than in GC tissues without LNM. Functional experiments showed that KIF26A inhibited migration and invasion of GC cells. We further identified focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PI3KR1), VAV3, Rac1 and p21-activated kinase 2, and beta-PAK (PAK3) as downstream effectors of KIF26A in the focal-adhesion pathway, and we found that KIF26A could regulate FAK mRNA expression through inhibiting c-MYC by MAPK pathway. c-MYC could bind to the promoter of FAK and activate FAK transcription. Moreover, we found that KIF26A-mediated inactivation of the focal-adhesion pathway could reduce the occurrence of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing expression of E-cadherin and reducing that of Snail. Luciferase assays and Western blotting revealed that miR-19a and miR-96 negatively regulate KIF26A. Finally, we found that decreased expression of KIF26A has been positively correlated with histological differentiation, Lauren classification, LNM, distal metastasis, and clinical stage, as well as poor survival in patients with GC. These data indicate that KIF26A could inhibit GC migration and invasion by regulating the focal-adhesion pathway and repressing the occurrence of EMT.

33686238	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), excessive activation of which has been considered to be involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we show that tyrosine kinase c-Src interacts with and phosphorylates G6PD at Tyr 112. This phosphorylation enhances catalytic activity of G6PD by dramatically decreasing its Km value and increasing its Kcat value for substrate glucose-6-phosphate. Activated G6PD therefore augments the PPP flux for NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate production which is required for detoxification of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and biosynthesis of cancer cells, and eventually contributes to tumorigenesis. Consistently, c-Src activation is closely correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of G6PD in clinical colorectal cancer samples. We thus uncover another aspect of c-Src in promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, deepening our understanding of c-Src as a proto-oncogene.	c-Src facilitates tumorigenesis by phosphorylating and activating G6PD.

33564070	The prognosis for patients with metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) is poor, and it is not improved by current treatments. RNA-binding motif protein X-linked (RBMX) are involved in the regulation of the malignant progression of various tumors. However, the role of RBMX in BCa tumorigenicity and progression remains unclear. In this study, we found that RBMX was significantly downregulated in BCa tissues, especially in muscle-invasive BCa tissues. RBMX expression was negatively correlated with tumor stage, histological grade and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that RBMX inhibited BCa cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hnRNP A1 was an RBMX-binding protein. RBMX competitively inhibited the combination of the RGG motif in hnRNP A1 and the sequences flanking PKM exon 9, leading to the formation of lower PKM2 and higher PKM1 levels, which attenuated the tumorigenicity and progression of BCa. Moreover, RBMX inhibited aerobic glycolysis through hnRNP A1-dependent PKM alternative splicing and counteracted the PKM2 overexpression-induced aggressive phenotype of the BCa cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that RBMX suppresses BCa tumorigenicity and progression via an hnRNP A1-mediated PKM alternative splicing mechanism. RBMX may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for clinical intervention in BCa.

33692467	Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN protein family of secreted proteins with roles in diverse biological processes. CTGF regulates biological functions such as cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, wound healing, and angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between CTGF and enhanced aerobic glycolysis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We found that CTGF is overexpressed in TNBC and high CTGF expression is correlated with a poor prognosis. Also, CTGF was required for in vivo tumorigenesis and in vitro proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion of TNBC cells. Our results indicate that extracellular CTGF binds directly to integrin alphavbeta3, activating the FAK/Src/NF-kappaB p65 signaling axis, which results in transcriptional upregulation of Glut3. Neutralization of CTGF decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through downregulation of Glut3-mediated glycolytic phenotypes. Overall, our work suggests a novel function for CTGF as a modulator of cancer metabolism, indicating that CTGF is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.

33712705	Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is the recommended treatment for local advanced cervical cancer, but radioresistance remains one of the most important and unresolved clinical problems. Investigations have revealed aberrant epigenetic modifications as one of the chief culprits for the development of radioresistance. Here, we attempt to identify a radiosensitizer from an epigenetic drug synergy screen and explore the underlying mechanism. We integrated epigenetic inhibitors and radiotherapy in cervical cancer cell lines to identify potential radiosensitizers. We further verified the sensitization effect of the drug and the function of its target gene both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we validated the clinical significance of its target gene in clinical cervical cancer specimens. We identified JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, as a potent radiosensitizer. Functional assays demonstrated that repressing BRD4 activity led to significant radiosensitization and potentiation of DNA damage in cervical cancer cell lines. By using RNA-seq to determine JQ1-mediated changes in transcription, we identified RAD51AP1 as a major BRD4 target gene involved in radiosensitivity. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR showed that BRD4 binds to the promoter region of RAD51AP1 and promotes its transcription, whereas this activity was attenuated by BRD4 inhibition. The in vivo experiments also suggested a synergy between BRD4 inhibition and radiotherapy. High BRD4 expression was found to be related to a worse prognosis and radiation resistance. BRD4 inhibition sensitizes cervical cancer to radiotherapy by inhibiting RAD51AP1 transcription. The combination of JQ1 with radiotherapy merits further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy for improving local control in cervical cancer.

33714987	Metabolic reprogramming is considered hallmarks of cancer. Aerobic glycolysis in tumors cells has been well-known for almost a century, but specific factors that regulate lactate generation and the effects of lactate in both cancer cells and stroma are not yet well understood. In the present study using breast cancer cell lines, human primary cultures of breast tumors, and immune deficient murine models, we demonstrate that the POU1F1 transcription factor is functionally and clinically related to both metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer cells and fibroblasts activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that POU1F1 transcriptionally regulates the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) gene. LDHA catalyzes pyruvate into lactate instead of leading into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Lactate increases breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, it activates normal-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Conversely, LDHA knockdown in breast cancer cells that overexpress POU1F1 decreases tumor volume and [(18)F]FDG uptake in tumor xenografts of mice. Clinically, POU1F1 and LDHA expression correlate with relapse- and metastasis-free survival. Our data indicate that POU1F1 induces a metabolic reprogramming through LDHA regulation in human breast tumor cells, modifying the phenotype of both cancer cells and fibroblasts to promote cancer progression.

33714986	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly malignant and has a high mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 8%. As a member of the roundabout immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins, ROBO1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and organogenesis and also inhibits metastasis in PC. Our study was designed to explore whether ROBO1 has effects on the proliferation of PC and its specific mechanism. The expression of ROBO1 was higher in cancer tissues than in matched adjacent tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qRT-PCR. Low ROBO1 expression is associated with PC progression and poor prognosis. Overexpression of ROBO1 can inhibit the proliferation of PC cells in vitro, and the S phase fraction can also be induced. Further subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice showed that ROBO1 overexpression can significantly inhibit tumor growth. YY1 was found to directly bind to the promoter region of ROBO1 to promote transcription by a luciferase reporter gene assay, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Mechanistic studies showed that YY1 can inhibit the development of PC by directly regulating ROBO1 via the CCNA2/CDK2 axis. Taken together, our results suggest that ROBO1 may be involved in the development and progression of PC by regulating cell proliferation and shows that ROBO1 may be a novel and promising therapeutic target for PC.

33716296	Osteosarcoma has a poor prognosis, and the poor understanding of the genetic drivers of osteosarcoma hinders further improvement in therapeutic approaches. Transcription factor forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) is a crucial modulator in skeletal development and aging. Here, we determined the role and regulatory mechanisms of FOXP1 in osteosarcoma. Higher FOXP1 expression correlated with malignancy in both osteosarcoma cell lines and clinical biopsies. FOXP1 overexpression and knockdown in osteosarcoma cell lines revealed that FOXP1 promoted proliferation, tumor sphere formation, migration and invasion, and inhibited anoikis. Mechanistically, FOXP1 acted as a repressor of P21 and RB (retinoblastoma protein) transcription, and directly interacted with the tumor suppressor p53 to inhibit its activity. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ERK/JNK) signaling and c-JUN/c-FOS transcription factors were found to be upstream activators of FOXP1. Moreover, FOXP1 silencing via lentivirus or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of shRNA suppressed osteosarcoma development and progression in cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft animal models. Taken together, we demonstrate that FOXP1, which is transactivated by ERK/JNK-c-JUN/c-FOS, drives osteosarcoma development by regulating the p53-P21/RB signaling cascade, suggesting that FOXP1 is a potential target for osteosarcoma therapy.

33742119	Radiation resistance is a major cause of lung cancer treatment failure. Armadillo (ARM) superfamily proteins participate in various fundamental cellular processes; however, whether ARM proteins regulate radiation resistance is not fully understood. Here, we used an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 library screen and identified plakophilin 2 (PKP2), a member of the ARM superfamily of proteins, as a critical driver of radiation resistance in lung cancer. The PKP2 level was significantly higher after radiotherapy than before radiotherapy, and high PKP2 expression after radiotherapy predicted poor overall survival (OS) and postprogression survival (PPS). Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis identified that PKP2 was methylated at the arginine site and interacted with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Methylation of PKP2 by PRMT1 stabilized beta-catenin by recruiting USP7, further inducing LIG4, a key DNA ligase in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Concomitantly, PKP2-induced radioresistance depended on facilitating LIG4-mediated NHEJ repair in lung cancer. More strikingly, after exposure to irradiation, treatment with the PRMT1 inhibitor C-7280948 abolished PKP2-induced radioresistance, and C-7280948 is a potential radiosensitizer in lung cancer. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting the PRMT1/PKP2/beta-catenin/LIG4 pathway is an effective approach to overcome radiation resistance in lung cancer.	CRISPR/Cas9 library screening uncovered methylated PKP2 as a critical driver of lung cancer radioresistance by stabilizing beta-catenin.	Oncogene
33742121	Cancer cells undergo metabolic adaption to sustain their survival and growth under metabolic stress conditions, yet the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. It is also not known if lncRNAs contribute to this metabolic adaption of cancer cells. Here we show that linc01564 is induced in response to glucose deprivation by the transcription factor ATF4. Linc01564 functions to facilitate hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival under glucose deprivation by activating the serine synthesis pathway. Mechanistically, linc01564 acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-107/103a-3p and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR-107/103a-3p on PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway, thereafter leading to increased PHGDH expression. Furthermore, linc01564 is able to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis via PHGDH. Together, these findings suggest that linc01564 is an important player in the regulation of metabolic adaption of cancer cells and also implicate linc01564 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer.

33758320	N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methylation is profoundly involved in epigenetic regulation, especially for carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Mounting evidence suggests that methyltransferase METTL3 regulates malignant behaviors of gastric cancer (GC). However, the clinical significance and biological implication of SPHK2 and its related m(6)A modification in GC remain unclear. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect the expression profiles and prognostic significance of SPHK2 in GC. Here, we showed that increased SPHK2 was signified a poor prognosis of GC patients. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination assays were used to investigate the possible mechanisms of SPHK2-mediated KLF2 expression. SPHK2 can promote the phosphorylation of KLF2, which triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of KLF2 protein in GC. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) was performed to uncover the m(6)A modification of SPHK2 mRNA. METTL3 promotes translation of SPHK2 mRNA via an m(6)A-YTHDF1-dependent manner. Functionally, SPHK2 facilitates GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by inhibiting KLF2 expression. SPHK2/KLF2 regulates the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by METTL3 in GC. Overall, our findings reveal that METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification of SPHK2 contributes to GC progression, which extends the understanding of the importance m(6)A methylation in GC and represents a potential target for GC therapy.

33824475	Radiotherapy is essential to the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and acquired or innate resistance to this therapeutic modality is a major clinical problem. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in the radiation resistance in NPC are not fully understood. Here, we reanalyzed the microarray data from public databases and identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) as a candidate gene. We found that PTPRD was downregulated in clinical NPC tissues and NPC cell lines with its promoter hypermethylated. Functional assays revealed that PTPRD overexpression sensitized NPC to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, miR-454-3p directly targets PTPRD to inhibit its expression and biological effect. Interestingly, mechanistic analyses indicate that PTPRD directly dephosphorylates STAT3 to enhance Autophagy-Related 5 (ATG5) transcription, resulting in triggering radiation-induced autophagy. The immunohistochemical staining of 107 NPC revealed that low PTPRD and high p-STAT3 levels predicted poor clinical outcome. Overall, we showed that PTPRD promotes radiosensitivity by triggering radiation-induced autophagy via the dephosphorylation of STAT3, thus providing a potentially useful predictive biomarker for NPC radiosensitivity and drug target for NPC radiosensitization.

33824474	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal malignancies and rapidly progressive diseases. Exosomes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as vital mediators in tumor cells and their microenvironment. However, the detailed roles and mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs in PDAC progression remain unknown. Here, we aimed to clarify the clinical significance and mechanisms of exosomal lncRNA 01133 (LINC01133) in PDAC. We analyzed the expression of LINC01133 in PDAC and found that exosomal LINC01133 expression was high and positively correlated with higher TNM stage and poor overall survival rate of PDAC patients. Further research demonstrated that Periostin could increase exosome secretion and then enhance LINC01133 expression. In addition, Periostin increased p-EGFR, p-Erk, and c-myc expression, and c-myc could bind to the LINC01133 promoter region. These findings suggested that LINC01133 can be regulated by Periostin via EGFR pathway activity. We also observed that LINC01133 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cells. We subsequently evaluated the effect of LINC01133 on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and confirmed that LINC01133 can interact with Enhancer Of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and then promote H3K27 trimethylation. This can further silence AXIN2 and suppress GSK3 activity, ultimately activating beta-catenin. Collectively, these data indicate that exosomal LINC01133 plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression, and targeting LINC01133 may provide a potential treatment strategy for PDAC.	Tumor-derived exosomal long noncoding RNA LINC01133, regulated by Periostin, contributes to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by silencing AXIN2.

33824472	Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) targeting proteins and genes; however, the role of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. We investigated the mechanism by which lncRNA SNHG6 promotes the development of HCC. RT-qPCR revealed upregulated lncRNA SNHG6 in the HCC setting. Elevated SNHG6 expression was indicative of poor prognosis in patients with HCC. SNHG6 overexpression resulted in increased cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and E2F1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. SNHG6 also promoted HCC cell proliferation by enhancing G1-S phase transition in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assays, RIP, and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated SNHG6 competitively bound to miR-204-5p and inhibited its expression preventing miR-204-5p from targeting E2F1. Overexpression of miR-204-5p abolished the effect of SNHG6. Our data suggest that SNHG6 functions as a ceRNA that targets miR-204-5p resulting in an increased E2F1 expression and enhanced G1-S phase transition, thereby promoting the tumorigenesis of HCC.

33833398	MicroRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) primarily target the 3' UTR of mRNAs to control their translation and stability. However, their co-regulatory effects on specific mRNAs in physiology and disease are yet to be fully explored. CSDE1 is an RBP that promotes metastasis in melanoma and mechanisms underlying its oncogenic activities need to be completely defined. Here we report that CSDE1 interacts with specific miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) in melanoma. We find an association of CSDE1 with AGO2, the essential component of miRISC, which is facilitated by target mRNAs and depends on the first cold shock domain of CSDE1. Both CSDE1 and AGO2 bind to 3' UTR of PMEPA1. CSDE1 counters AGO2 binding, leading to an increase of PMEPA1 expression. We also identify a miRNA, miR-129-5p, that represses PMEPA1 expression in melanoma. Collectively, our results show that PMEPA1 promotes tumorigenic traits and that CSDE1 along with miR-129-5p/AGO2 miRISC act antagonistically to fine-tune PMEPA1 expression toward the progression of melanoma.

33846571	The molecular mechanisms of luminal cell differentiation are not understood well enough to determine how differentiation goes awry during oncogenesis. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we discovered that CREB1 plays a central role in maintaining new luminal cell survival and that oncogenesis dramatically changes the CREB1-induced transcriptome. CREB1 is active in luminal cells, but not basal cells. We identified ING4 and its E3 ligase, JFK, as CREB1 transcriptional targets in luminal cells. During luminal cell differentiation, transient induction of ING4 expression is followed by a peak in CREB1 activity, while JFK increases concomitantly with CREB1 activation. Transient expression of ING4 is required for luminal cell induction; however, failure to properly down-regulate ING4 leads to luminal cell death. Consequently, blocking CREB1 increased ING4 expression, suppressed JFK, and led to luminal cell death. Thus, CREB1 is responsible for the suppression of ING4 required for luminal cell survival and maintenance. Oncogenic transformation by suppressing PTEN resulted in constitutive activation of CREB1. However, the tumor cells could no longer fully differentiate into luminal cells, failed to express ING4, and displayed a unique CREB1 transcriptome. Blocking CREB1 in tumorigenic cells suppressed tumor growth in vivo, rescued ING4 expression, and restored luminal cell formation, but ultimately induced luminal cell death. IHC of primary prostate tumors demonstrated a strong correlation between loss of ING4 and loss of PTEN. This is the first study to define a molecular mechanism whereby oncogenic loss of PTEN, leading to aberrant CREB1 activation, suppresses ING4 expression causing disruption of luminal cell differentiation.

33846574	We provide evidence that a member of the human Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, SLFN5, is overexpressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Targeted deletion of SLFN5 results in decreased PDAC cell proliferation and suppresses PDAC tumorigenesis in in vivo PDAC models. Importantly, high expression levels of SLFN5 correlate with worse outcomes in PDAC patients, implicating SLFN5 in the pathophysiology of PDAC that leads to poor outcomes. Our studies establish novel regulatory effects of SLFN5 on cell cycle progression through binding/blocking of the transcriptional repressor E2F7, promoting transcription of key genes that stimulate S phase progression. Together, our studies suggest an essential role for SLFN5 in PDAC and support the potential for developing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of pancreatic cancer through SLFN5 targeting.

33846573	PR domain zinc finger protein 4 (PRDM4) is a transcription factor that plays key roles in stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. However, its biological role and exact mechanism in cervical cancer remain unknown. Here, both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot assays demonstrated that the expression of PRDM4 in cervical cancer tissues was much lower than that in the normal cervix. A xenograft assay showed that PRDM4 overexpression in the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and HeLa dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vivo. Conversely, the silencing of PRDM4 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, PRDM4 induced cell cycle arrest at the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase by upregulating p27 and p21 expression and downregulating Cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inactivated in PRDM4-overexpressing cells, which decreased the levels of p-AKT and upregulated the expression of PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and qChIP assays confirmed that PRDM4 transactivated the expression of PTEN by binding to two specific regions in the PTEN promoter. Furthermore, PTEN silencing or a PTEN inhibitor rescued the cell defects induced by PRDM4 overexpression. Therefore, our data suggest that PRDM4 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by downregulating the activity of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by directly transactivating PTEN expression in cervical cancer.

33863999	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, accounting for high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms governing tumor growth and metastasis in CRC require detailed investigation. The results of the present study indicated that the transcription factor (TF) myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) plays a dual role in promoting proliferation and metastasis of CRC by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Aberrant expression of MEF2A in CRC clinical specimens was significantly associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Functionally, MEF2A directly binds to the promoter region to initiate the transcription of ZEB2 and CTNNB1. Simultaneous activation of the expression of EMT-related TFs and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by MEF2A overexpression induced the EMT and increased the frequency of tumor formation and metastasis. The present study identified a new critical oncogene involved in the growth and metastasis of CRC, providing a potential novel therapeutic target for CRC intervention.

33875786	Poorly differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by aggressive invasion and stromal fibroblast activation, which results in rapid progression and poor therapeutic consequences. However, the regulatory mechanism involved remains unclear. Here, we showed that ZNF37A, a member of KRAB-ZFP family, was upregulated in poorly differentiated CRCs and associated with tumor metastasis. ZNF37A enhanced the metastatic potential of multiple CRC cell lines and promoted distant metastasis in an orthotopic CRC model. Further investigation attributed the ZNF37A-exacerbated metastasis to increased extracellular TGF-beta and the consequent activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, ZNF37A formed a complex with KAP1 and bound to the promoter of THSD4, a TME modulator, to suppress its transcription, which is required for ZNF37A-mediated TGF-beta activation and CRC metastasis. Collectively, our study indicates that ZNF37A promotes TGF-beta signaling in CRC cells and activates CAFs by transcriptionally repressing THSD4 to drive CRC metastasis, implicating ZNF37A as a potential biomarker for CRC differentiation and progression.

33888868	Extramedullary infiltration (EMI), as a concomitant symptom of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is associated with low complete remission and poor prognosis in AML. However, the mechanism of EMI remains indistinct. Clinical trials showed that increased miR-29s were associated with a poor overall survival in AML [14]. Nevertheless, they were proved to work as tumor suppressor genes by encouraging apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in vitro. These contradictory results led us to the hypothesis that miR-29s may play a notable role in the prognosis of AML rather than leukemogenesis. Thus, we explored the specimens of AML patients and addressed this issue into miR-29c&b2 knockout mice. As a result, a poor overall survival and invasive blast cells were observed in high miR-29c&b2-expression patients, and the wildtype mice presented a shorter survival with heavier leukemia infiltration in extramedullary organs. Subsequently, we found that the miR-29c&b2 inside leukemia cells promoted EMI, but not the one in the microenvironment. The analysis of signal pathway revealed that miR-29c&b2 could target HMG-box transcription factor 1 (Hbp1) directly, then reduced Hbp1 bound to the promoter of non-muscle myosin IIB (Myh10) as a transcript inhibitor. Thus, increased Myh10 encouraged the migration of leukemia cells. Accordingly, AML patients with EMI were confirmed to have high miR-29c&b2 and MYH10 with low HBP1. Therefore, we identify that miR-29c&b2 contribute to the poor prognosis of AML patients by promoting EMI, and related genes analyses are prospectively feasible in assessment of AML outcome.	miR-29c&b2 encourage extramedullary infiltration resulting in the poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

33927350	Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a vital regulator of tumor metastasis. However, the mechanisms governing OXPHOS to facilitate tumor metastasis remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that arginine 21(R21) and lysine 108 (K108) of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 (MRPS23) was methylated by the protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) and SET-domain-containing protein 6 (SETD6), respectively. R21 methylation accelerated the poly-ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MRPS23 to a low level. The MRPS23 degradation inhibited OXPHOS with elevated mtROS level, which consequently increased breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In contrast, K108 methylation increased MRPS23 stability, and K108 methylation coordinated with R21 methylation to maintain a low level of MRPS23, which was in favor of supporting breast cancer cell survival through regulating OXPHOS. Consistently, R21 and K108 methylation was correlated with malignant breast carcinoma. Significantly, our findings unveil a unique mechanism of controlling OXPHOS by arginine and lysine methylation and point to the impact of the PRMT7-SETD6-MRPS23 axis during breast cancer metastasis.

33931740	The SNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor through multiple mechanisms, including impairing the ability of the oncoprotein transcription factor MYC to bind chromatin. Beyond SNF5, however, it is unknown to what extent MYC can access additional SWI/SNF subunits or how these interactions affect the ability of MYC to drive transcription, particularly in SNF5-null cancers. Here, we report that MYC interacts with multiple SWI/SNF components independent of SNF5. We show that MYC binds the pan-SWI/SNF subunit BAF155 through the BAF155 SWIRM domain, an interaction that is inhibited by the presence of SNF5. In SNF5-null cells, MYC binds with remaining SWI/SNF components to essential genes, although for a purpose that is distinct from chromatin remodeling. Analysis of MYC-SWI/SNF target genes in SNF5-null cells reveals that they are associated with core biological functions of MYC linked to protein synthesis. These data reveal that MYC can bind SWI/SNF in an SNF5-independent manner and that SNF5 modulates access of MYC to core SWI/SNF complexes. This work provides a framework in which to interrogate the influence of SWI/SNF on MYC function in cancers in which SWI/SNF or MYC are altered.

33941853	Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2) is a key member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, while YES Proto-Oncogene 1 (YES1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (nRTK) and annexin A2 (ANXA2) belongs to the calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family annexins. Here, we show that EphA2, YES1, and ANXA2 form a signal axis, in which YES1 activated by EphA2 phosphorylates ANXA2 at Tyr24 site, leading to ANXA2 activation and increased ANXA2 nuclear distribution in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Overexpression (OE) of YES1 increases, while knockdown (KD) of YES1 or ANXA2 decreases GC cell invasion and migration in vitro and tumor growth in mouse models. Reexpression of wildtype (WT) rather than mutant ANXA2 (Tyr24F) in ANXA2 knockdown (ANXA2-KD) GC cells restores YES1-induced cell invasion and migration, while neither WT nor mutant ANXA2 (Tyr24F) can restore cell invasion and migration in YES1-KD GC cells. In addition, the activation of EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 pathway is correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, our results establish EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 axis as a novel pathway that drives GC invasion and metastasis, targeting this pathway would be an efficient way for the treatment of GC.

33941855	Activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) pathway modulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth arrest, motility, and embryogenesis. An expression screen for long noncoding RNAs indicated that TGFbeta induced mir-100-let-7a-2-mir-125b-1 cluster host gene (MIR100HG) expression in diverse cancer types, thus confirming an earlier demonstration of TGFbeta-mediated transcriptional induction of MIR100HG in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MIR100HG depletion attenuated TGFbeta signaling, expression of TGFbeta-target genes, and TGFbeta-mediated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, MIR100HG silencing inhibited both normal and cancer cell motility and enhanced the cytotoxicity of cytostatic drugs. MIR100HG overexpression had an inverse impact on TGFbeta signaling responses. Screening for downstream effectors of MIR100HG identified the ligand TGFbeta1. MIR100HG and TGFB1 mRNA formed ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RNA-binding protein HuR, promoting TGFbeta1 cytokine secretion. In addition, TGFbeta regulated let-7a-2-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-125b-1-3p expression, all encoded by MIR100HG intron-3. Certain intron-3 miRNAs may be involved in TGFbeta/SMAD-mediated responses (let-7a-2-3p) and others (miR-100, miR-125b) in resistance to cytotoxic drugs mediated by MIR100HG. In support of a model whereby TGFbeta induces MIR100HG, which then enhances TGFbeta1 secretion, analysis of human carcinomas showed that MIR100HG expression correlated with expression of TGFB1 and its downstream extracellular target TGFBI. Thus, MIR100HG controls the magnitude of TGFbeta signaling via TGFbeta1 autoinduction and secretion in carcinomas.	The noncoding MIR100HG RNA enhances the autocrine function of transforming growth factor beta signaling.	Oncogene
33941854	Esophageal cancer is a complex malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In Eastern Asia including China, about 90% of all incident cases have esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mounting evidence elucidates that aberrant expression of various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) contributes to ESCC progression, but it remains unclear how small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in ESCC development. We systemically screened clinically relevant snoRNAs in ESCC via integrative analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and validation in ESCC tissues. We found that snoRNA SNORD12B was one of the most evidently upregulated snoRNAs in ESCC specimens and its high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients. SNORD12B profoundly promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating its oncogene nature. In particular, SNORD12B could interact with PP-1alpha, one of the three catalytic subunits of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1, which is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates AKT to suppress its activation. Interestingly, high levels of SNORD12B in ESCC cells could break interactions between 14-3-3zeta and PP-1alpha, abolish the retention of PP-1alpha in the cytosol by 14-3-3zeta and relocate PP-1alpha from the cytosol to the nucleus. This led to sequestered PP-1alpha in the nucleus, enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the cytosol, activated AKT-mTOR-4EBP1 signaling, and, thus, ESCC progression. These insights would improve our understanding of how snoRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis and highlight the potential of snoRNAs as future therapeutic targets against cancers.

33958724	The t(8;21) fusion product, AML1/ETO, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) form a feed-forward transcription loop that cooperatively transactivates the DNA methyltransferase 3a gene promoter that leads to DNA hypermethylation and drives leukemia cell growth. Suppression of the RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)-reader enzyme YTH N(6)-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) specifically compromises cancer stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but promotes hematopoietic stem cell expansion without derailing normal hematopoiesis. However, the relevance of expression between AML1/ETO-HIF1alpha loop and YTHDF2, and its functional relationship with t(8;21) AML have not been documented. Here, we show that YTHDF2 is highly expressed in t(8;21) AML patients and associated with a higher risk of relapse and inferior relapse-free survival. Knockdown of YTHDF2 in leukemia cells causes an impaired cell proliferation rate in vitro and in mice. Mechanistically, HIF1alpha is able to bind to the hypoxia-response elements of the 5'-untranslated region of the YTHDF2 gene and promotes the transactivity of the YTHDF2 promoter. Knockdown and overexpression of either AML1/ETO or HIF1alpha resulted in decreased and increased YTHDF2 protein and mRNA expression in t(8;21) AML cells. In particular, knockdown of YTHDF2 resulted in increased global mRNA m(6)A levels in t(8;21) AML cells, accompanied by increased TNF receptor superfamily member 1b (TNFRSF1b) mRNA and protein expression levels. Last, we demonstrated that the m(6)A methylation and expression levels of the TNFRSF1b gene were both negatively correlated with HIF1alpha expression levels. In conclusion, YTHDF2 is a downstream target of the AML1/ETO-HIF1alpha loop and promotes cell proliferation probably by modulating the global m(6)A methylation in t(8;21) AML.	YTHDF2 is a potential target of AML1/ETO-HIF1alpha loop-mediated cell proliferation in t(8;21) AML.	Oncogene
33958721	Despite the development of new targeted and immune therapies, the prognosis of metastatic melanoma remains bleak. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms controlling advanced melanoma to develop more effective treatment regimens. Hedgehog/GLI (HH/GLI) signaling inhibitors targeting the central pathway transducer Smoothened (SMO) have shown to be clinical efficacious in skin cancer; however, several mechanisms of non-canonical HH/GLI pathway activation limit their efficacy. Here, we identify a novel SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex driving the expression of GLI1, the final effector of the HH/GLI pathway, providing a novel mechanism of non-canonical SMO-independent activation of HH/GLI signaling in melanoma. Consistently, we find a positive correlation between the expression of GLI1 and SOX2 in human melanoma samples and cell lines. Further, we show that combined targeting of canonical HH/GLI pathway with the SMO inhibitor MRT-92 and of the SOX2-BRD4 complex using a potent Proteolysis Targeted Chimeras (PROTACs)-derived BRD4 degrader (MZ1), yields a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in melanoma cells independently of their BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 mutational status, with complete abrogation of GLI1 expression. Combination of MRT-92 and MZ1 strongly potentiates the antitumor effect of either drug as single agents in an orthotopic melanoma model. Together, our data provide evidence of a novel mechanism of non-canonical activation of GLI1 by the SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex, and describe the efficacy of a new combinatorial treatment for a subset of melanomas with an active SOX2-BRD4-GLI1 axis.	Targeting non-canonical activation of GLI1 by the SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex improves the efficacy of HEDGEHOG pathway inhibition in melanoma.	Oncogene
33972684	An increasing number of studies have shown that long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of protein in a variety of tumors. However, little is known about the exact regulation mechanism of lncRNAs in regulating PTMs in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) proliferation. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript1 (MALAT1) and GINS complex subunit 1(GINS1) both were upregulated and promoted proliferation progression in NSCLC. In this study, the clinicopathologic significance of MALAT1 and GINS1 in NSCLC was investigated, a positive correlation in their expression was found. The silencing of MALAT1 decreased GINS1 expression and inhibited NSCLC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The upregulation of GINS1 reversed NSCLC proliferation inhibited by MALAT1 knockdown. FOXP3 (forkhead box protein 3) was identified as the critical transcription factor for GINS1 transcription. In addition, MALAT1 could stabilize FOXP3 by binding to zinc finger (ZF) domain and leucine zipper (LZ) domain of FOXP3. Interestingly, these two domains were also interaction domains for FOXP3 binding with E3 ligase STUB1 (STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1). In this way, MALAT1 masked the protein-interacting domain, and inhibited FOXP3 ubiquitination by STUB1. Together, our results identified a novel regulatory axis of MALAT1-FOXP3-GINS1, and demonstrated that MALAT1 played an important modulatory role in PTM of FOXP3 which affects GINS1 transcription and drives proliferation character in NSCLC.	MALAT1 modulated FOXP3 ubiquitination then affected GINS1 transcription and drived NSCLC proliferation.	Oncogene
33981002	There is overwhelming clinical evidence that the extracellular-regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5) is significantly dysregulated in human breast cancer. However, there is no definite understanding of the requirement of ERK5 in tumor growth and metastasis due to very limited characterization of the pathway in disease models. In this study, we report that a high level of ERK5 is a predictive marker of metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistically, our in vitro data revealed that ERK5 was critical for maintaining the invasive capability of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells through focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) activation. Specifically, we found that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 was controlled by a kinase-independent function of ERK5. Accordingly, silencing ERK5 in mammary tumor grafts impaired FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 and suppressed TNBC cell metastasis to the lung without preventing tumor growth. Collectively, these results establish a functional relationship between ERK5 and FAK signaling in promoting malignancy. Thus, targeting the oncogenic ERK5-FAK axis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer exhibiting aggressive clinical behavior.

33986509	Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Tumor-intrinsic properties can determine whether tumor metastasis occurs or not. Here, by comparing the gene expression patterns in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with or without metastasis, we found that Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1 (CTHRC1) in primary CRC served as a metastasis-associated gene. Animal experiments verified that CTHRC1 secreted by CRC cells promoted hepatic metastasis, which was closely correlated with macrophage infiltration. Depletion of macrophages by liposomal clodronate largely abolished the promoting effect of CTHRC1 on CRC liver metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CTHRC1 modulated macrophage polarization to M2 phenotypes through TGF-beta signaling. A mechanistic study revealed that CTHRC1 bound directly to TGF-beta receptor II and TGF-beta receptor III, stabilized the TGF-beta receptor complex, and activated TGF-beta signaling. The combination treatment of CTHRC1 monoclonal antibody and anti-PD-1 blocking antibody effectively suppressed CRC hepatic metastasis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that CTHRC1 is an intrinsic marker of CRC metastasis and further revealed that CTHRC1 promoted CRC liver metastasis by reshaping infiltrated macrophages through TGF-beta signaling, suggesting that CTHRC1 could be a potential biomarker for the early prediction of and a therapeutic target of CRC hepatic metastasis.

34007022	"The Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 22 (USP22) is a deubiquitinating subunit of the mammalian SAGA transcriptional co-activating complex. USP22 was identified as a member of the so-called ""death-from-cancer"" signature predicting therapy failure in cancer patients. However, the importance and functional role of USP22 in different types and subtypes of cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we leveraged human cell lines and genetic mouse models to investigate the role of USP22 in HER2-driven breast cancer (HER2(+)-BC) and demonstrate for the first time that USP22 is required for the tumorigenic properties in murine and human HER2(+)-BC models. To get insight into the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses and identified the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as a pathway deregulated upon USP22 loss. The UPR is normally induced upon extrinsic or intrinsic stresses that can promote cell survival and recovery if shortly activated or programmed cell death if activated for an extended period. Strikingly, we found that USP22 actively suppresses UPR induction in HER2(+)-BC cells by stabilizing the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone HSPA5. Consistently, loss of USP22 renders tumor cells more sensitive to apoptosis and significantly increases the efficiency of therapies targeting the ER folding capacity. Together, our data suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting USP22 activity may sensitize tumor cells to UPR induction and could provide a novel, effective approach to treat HER2(+)-BC."

34012098	Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) contributes to the invasive progression of breast cancers by degrading extracellular matrix tissues. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NME1/NM23-H1, has been identified as a metastasis suppressor; however, its contribution to local invasion in breast cancer is not known. Here, we report that NME1 is up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as compared to normal breast epithelial tissues. NME1 levels drop in microinvasive and invasive components of breast tumor cells relative to synchronous DCIS foci. We find a strong anti-correlation between NME1 and plasma membrane MT1-MMP levels in the invasive components of breast tumors, particularly in aggressive histological grade III and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockout of NME1 accelerates the invasive transition of breast tumors in the intraductal xenograft model. At the mechanistic level, we find that MT1-MMP, NME1 and dynamin-2, a GTPase known to require GTP production by NME1 for its membrane fission activity in the endocytic pathway, interact in clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. Loss of NME1 function increases MT1-MMP surface levels by inhibiting endocytic clearance. As a consequence, the ECM degradation and invasive potentials of breast cancer cells are enhanced. This study identifies the down-modulation of NME1 as a potent driver of the in situ-to invasive transition during breast cancer progression.

34017080	BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) that target BRAF V600E kinase, a driver mutation found in 50% of melanomas, show a significant antitumor response, but the common emergence of acquired resistance remains a challenge. Abnormal expression of RAF isoforms CRAF and ARAF reactivates pERK1/2, which plays crucial roles in the acquisition of resistance of melanoma cells. However, the mechanisms of dysregulation of RAF isoforms in resistant melanoma cells remain unknown. Here, we identified NONO interacted with and stabilized both CRAF and ARAF in melanoma cells, and that NONO was acetylated at 198K by p300 acetyltransferase, which stabilized NONO via antagonizing its ubiquitination/degradation mediated by RNF8. The upregulation of both p300 and NONO promoted the rebound of pERK1/2 and the subsequent resistance of melanoma cells to BRAFi, and the activation of ERK1/2 in turn induced p300 to form a positive feedback loop in resistant melanoma cells. There was a positive correlation between p300 and NONO in resistant melanoma cells and clinical samples, and p300 inhibitor C646 overcame the resistance of resistant melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal that targeting the positive feedback loop of p300-NONO-CRAF/ARAF-pERK1/2 may be excellent strategies to overcome the resistance of BRAF inhibitors for melanoma patients.

34050266	Emerging evidences suggest that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Here, the aim of this study is to investigate the biological function of long intervening noncoding RNA Linc00284 in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression levels of Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met were evaluated by qPCR and/or Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Ki67 and Phh3 in tumor tissues. The interaction between Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met was validated by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Cell function experiments, including CCK-8, wound-healing and transwell invasion assays, were conducted. The in vivo studies were performed with the subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse models. Our findings reveal that Linc00284 is upregulated in CRC tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 in comparison with corresponding para-carcinoma tissues and human fetal colonic mucosa cells FHC. High expression of Linc00284 in tumor tissues is associated with tumor metastasis and predicts a poor clinical outcome in CRC patients. Serum Linc00284 is increased, while miR-27a is decreased in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analysis indicates that serum Linc00284 and miR-27a produce the area under the curve (AUC) value of at 0.8151 and 0.7316 in patients with colorectal cancer compared to healthy individuals, respectively. Additionally, results in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that Linc00284 silencing significantly suppresses CRC cell proliferation and/or invasion. Mechanistically, Linc00284 promotes c-Met expression by acting as miR-27a sponge, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, thereby causing malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. Taken together, Linc00284 exhibits oncogenic function and the disturbance of Linc00284/miR-27a/c-Met regulatory axis contributes to CRC progression, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Importantly, the expression levels of serum Linc00284 and miR-27a may serve as clinical biomarkers for CRC diagnosis.

34079086	Hypoxia and related oxidative stress are closely related to the development and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism mediated by hypoxia in HCC has not yet been elucidated. Here, we found multifunction scaffold protein p54(nrb)/NONO exerted pleiotropic effects to regulate hypoxia transcription signals, thereby enhancing the progression of liver cancer. Extensive analysis of clinical data demonstrated that NONO was significantly upregulated and represented as a poor prognostic indicator of HCC. The crucial role of NONO in driving angiogenesis and glycolysis, two well-known cancer phenotypes mediated by hypoxia, was examined in vitro an in vivo. Mechanistically, NONO interacted with and stabilized both HIF-1 and HIF-2 complexes thus activating the transcription of hypoxia-induced genes. Besides, NONO bound pre-mRNA and subsequent mRNA of these genes to facilitate them splicing and mRNA stability, respectively. Thus, NONO knockout seriously disrupted the expression of a cluster of HIF-1/2 targets and impeded hypoxia-enhanced progression in HCC. In conclusion, NONO functioned as a multipurpose scaffold that interacted with HIF-1/2 complex and their downstream transcripts to facilitate the expression of hypoxia-induced genes, allowing malignant proliferation, indicating that NONO might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

34079090	Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer with limited treatment option in males. Although the reactivation of embryonic signals in adult cells is one of the characteristics of cancer, the underlying protein degradation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone GRP75 is a key player in PC cells by maintaining the protein stability of SIX1, a transcription factor for embryonic development. Mechanistically, GRP75 provides a platform to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 to inhibit K48-linked polyubiquitination of SIX1. Structurally, the C-terminus of GRP75 (433-679 aa) contains a peptide binding domain, which is required for the formation of GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex. Functionally, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex suppresses tumor growth and overcomes the castration resistance of PC cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Clinically, the protein expression of SIX1 in PC tumor tissues is positively correlated with the expression of GRP75 and USP1. These new findings not only enhance our understanding of the protein degradation mechanism, but also may provide a potential way to enhance the anti-cancer activity of androgen suppression therapy.

34079082	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Glypican-5 (GPC5) is a member of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and its biological importance in initiation and progression of lung cancer remains controversial. In the present study, we revealed that GPC5 transcriptionally enhanced the expression of CTDSP1 (miR-26b host gene) via AhR-ARNT pathway, and such up-regulation of CTDSP1 intracellularly contributed to the inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells. Moreover, exosomes derived from GPC5-overexpressing human lung cancer cells (GPC5-OE-derived exosomes) had an extracellular repressive effect on human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs), leading to decreased tube formation and migration. Comparison between GPC5-WT- and GPC5-OE-derived exosomes showed that miR-26b (embedded within introns of CTDSP1 gene) was significantly up-regulated in GPC5-OE-derived exosomes and critical to the influence on hLECs. On the mechanism, we demonstrated that miR-26b transferred into hLECs directly targeted to PTK2 3'-UTR and led to PTK2 down-regulation, resulting in defects in tube formation and migration of hLECs. By uncovering the regulation network among GPC5, miR-26b, miR-26b host gene (CTDSP1), and target gene (PTK2), our findings demonstrated that GPC5 functioned as a tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.

34079085	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is aggressive and has poor clinical outcomes because of typically delayed diagnosis and a lack of effective non-surgical therapeutic options. Recent studies have shown that plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is related to angiogenesis in various tumors, and in vivo PLVAP targeting therapy has been proven effective against hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the potential therapeutic utility of targeting PLVAP and thus angiogenesis in CCA and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the PLVAP expression levels were significantly higher in CCA tissues when compared with matched adjacent non-tumor tissues obtained from a total of 90 CCA patients; higher expression levels of PLVAP were associated with shorter overall survival of patients. In addition, overexpression of PLVAP was associated with higher micro-vessel density in CCA tissues. In a PLVAP overexpressing CCA patient-derived xenograft model, a novel humanized anti-PLVAP antibody in combination with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin was significantly inhibited tumor growth. Molecular analysis of CCA cells co-cultured with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells or human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells showed that Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) secreted by CCA cells activated the PI3K/Akt pathway after binding to its receptor, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), resulting in the upregulation of PLVAP. Thus, CCA cells increased the angiogenic potency of endothelial cells in a paracrine fashion. Consistently, patients bearing CKAP4 and PLVAP overexpressing tumors had a poor prognosis. In conclusion, the DKK1/CKAP4/PI3K/PLVAP pathway increases angiogenesis in CCA and is therefore a potential anti-angiogenic target.

34103686	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients mostly suffer from poor survival outcomes. It is necessary to identify effective therapeutic targets to improve prognosis for HCC patients. Here, we report a new factor, CDCA2, in promoting HCC development. CDCA2 amplification is an independent risk factor for the recurrence and survival of HCC patients, which is positively correlated with elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), high histological grade, large tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and poor prognosis for HCC patients. In HCC cells, CDCA2 promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis. Mechanistically, CDCA2's transcription is activated through the binding of E2F2/E2F8 with its promoter. CDCA2 depletion contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis due to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated stress, which can be reversed by antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH). Interestingly, we found that CDCA2 triggers the BRCA1-NRF2 cascade, which elevates antioxidant response and attenuates ROS levels. In response to oxidative stress, CDCA2 promotes BRCA1's chromatin relocalization to NRF2, activating NRF2-driven downstream signaling (HO-1, TXNRD1, and NQO1), which then protects HCC cells against oxidative damage. In conclusion, our results reveal that CDCA2 is a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients, and present the E2F2/E2F8-CDCA2-BRCA1-NRF2-ROS signaling axis that have implications for HCC therapeutics.

34103681	Recurrence of metastatic breast cancer stemming from acquired endocrine and chemotherapy resistance remains a health burden for women with luminal (ER(+)) breast cancer. Disseminated ER(+) tumor cells can remain viable but quiescent for years to decades. Contributing factors to metastatic spread include the maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Breast CSCs frequently exist as a minority population in therapy resistant tumors. In this study, we show that cytoplasmic complexes composed of steroid receptor (SR) co-activators, PELP1 and SRC-3, modulate breast CSC expansion through upregulation of the HIF-activated metabolic target genes PFKFB3 and PFKFB4. Seahorse metabolic assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic PELP1 influences cellular metabolism by increasing both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. PELP1 interacts with PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 proteins, and inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 kinase activity blocks PELP1-induced tumorspheres and protein-protein interactions with SRC-3. PFKFB4 knockdown inhibited in vivo emergence of circulating tumor cell (CTC) populations in mammary intraductal (MIND) models. Application of PFKFB inhibitors in combination with ER targeted therapies blocked tumorsphere formation in multiple models of advanced breast cancer including tamoxifen (TamR) and paclitaxel (TaxR) resistant models, murine tumor cells, and ER(+) patient-derived organoids (PDxO). Together, our data suggest that PELP1, SRC-3, and PFKFBs cooperate to drive ER(+) tumor cell populations that include CSCs and CTCs. Identifying non-ER pharmacological targets offers a useful approach to blocking metastatic escape from standard of care ER/estrogen (E2)-targeted strategies to overcome endocrine and chemotherapy resistance.

34108621	Research over the past decade has suggested important roles for pseudogenes in glioma. This study aimed to show that pseudogene PRELI domain-containing 1 pseudogene 6 (PRELID1P6) promotes glioma progression. Aberrant expression of genes was screened using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We found that mRNA level of PRELID1P6 was highly upregulated in glioma and was associated with a shorter survival time. Functional studies showed that the knockdown of PRELID1P6 decreased cell proliferation, sphere formation, and clone formation ability and blocked the cell cycle transition at G0/G1, while overexpression of PRELID1P6 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRELID1P6 changed the cellular localization of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, which promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hnRNPH1. RNA-sequence and gene set enrichment analysis suggested that knockdown of PRELID1P6 regulates the apoptosis signaling pathway. Western blotting showed that PRELID1P6 increased TRF2 expression by hnRNPH1-mediated alternative splicing effect and activated the Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, Akt inhibitor MK2206 treatment reversed the oncogenic function of PRELID1P6. PRELID1P6 was also found to be negatively regulated by miR-1825. Our result showed that PRELID1P6 promotes glioma progression through the hnHNPH1-Akt/mTOR pathway. These findings shed new light on the important role of PRELID1P6 as a novel oncogene for glioma.

34108620	MPDZ also named MUPP1 is involved in signal transduction mediated by the formation of protein complexes. However, the expression regulation, clinical significance, potential function, and mechanism of this gene in lung cancer remain unclear. Methylation status of MPDZ was measured by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic value of MPDZ. The tumor suppressing effects of MPDZ were determined in vitro and in vivo. The target molecules and signaling pathway that mediated the function of MPDZ were also identified. MPDZ methylation was identified in 61.2% of primary lung cancer tissues and most lung cancer cell lines but not in normal lung tissues. MPDZ expression was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues and negatively associated with DNA hypermethylation, and attenuated MPDZ expression predicted a poor outcome. Furthermore, MPDZ overexpression prominently dampened cell growth, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Conversely, MPDZ knockdown promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MPDZ deficiency promotes tumor metastasis and reduces the survival of MPDZ knockout mice. Importantly, MPDZ promotes tumor suppressor ability that depends on the Hippo pathway-mediated repression of YAP. MPDZ activates the phosphorylation of YAP (Ser127) and inhibits YAP expression through stabilizing MST1 and interaction with LATS1. We first identified and validated that MPDZ methylation and expression could be a good diagnostic marker and independent prognostic factor for lung cancer. MPDZ functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through regulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

34117362	Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is overexpressed in various cancers and promotes cancer cell proliferation by binding to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4). However, the mechanisms underlying DKK1 expression are poorly understood. RNA sequence analysis revealed that expression of the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and its target genes concordantly fluctuated with expression of DKK1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. DKK1 knockdown decreased FOXM1 expression and vice versa in PDAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Inhibition of either the DKK1-CKAP4-AKT pathway or the ERK pathway suppressed FOXM1 expression, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways showed synergistic effects. A FOXM1 binding site was identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the DKK1 gene, and its depletion decreased DKK1 expression and cancer cell proliferation. Clinicopathological and database analysis revealed that PDAC and ESCC patients who simultaneously express DKK1 and FOXM1 have a poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that expression of both DKK1 and FOXM1 is the independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients. Although it has been reported that FOXM1 enhances Wnt signaling, FOXM1 induced DKK1 expression independently of Wnt signaling in PDAC and ESCC cells. These results suggest that DKK1 and FOXM1 create a positive feedback loop to promote cancer cell proliferation.

34127813	Asporin (ASPN) presents in the tumor microenvironment and exhibits a cancer-promoting effect as a stroma protein. Even though ASPN has already been observed inside cancer cells, the functions of intracellular ASPN and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we reported that ASPN was upregulated in different stages of gastric cancer (GC), and associated with a poor prognosis. Moreover, we found that ASPN markedly inhibited GC cell apoptosis and promoted cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism investigations revealed that ASPN directly binding to lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and promoted LEF1-mediated gene transcription independent of beta-catenin, the classic co-factor in the Wnt/LEF1 pathway. We also demonstrated that ASPN selectively facilitated LEF1 binding to and activating the promoters of PTGS2, IL6, and WISP1 to promote their transcription. The suppression of cell apoptosis by ASPN overexpression could be attenuated by LEF1 knockdown or 100 microM aspirin (PTGS2 inhibitor), and siASPN mediated apoptosis could be rescued by LEF1 ectopic expression or adding recombinant IL6. Therefore, we concluded that ASPN repressed GC cell apoptosis via activating LEF1-mediated gene transcription independent of beta-catenin, which could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in GC patients.

34131285	Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are critical components of DNA-replication-licensing factors. MCM8 is an MCM protein that exhibits oncogenic functions in several human malignancies. However, the role of MCM8 in glioblastomas (GBMs) has remained unclear. In the present study, we investigated the biological functions and mechanisms of MCM8 in glioma stem cells (GSCs). The clinical relevance of MCM8 mRNA expression was explored via TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets. The effects of MCM8 on the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GSCs were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The regulation of MCM8 expression and its interacting proteins were also evaluated. We found that the expression of MCM8 was elevated in high-grade gliomas and classical molecular subtypes and was inversely correlated with patient prognosis. GSCs had a significantly higher expression of MCM8 compared with that in normal glioma cells. Silencing of MCM8 induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis, as well as inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs. Forced expression of MCM8 enhanced clonogenicity of GSCs both in vitro and in vivo. MCM8 expression was regulated by EGFR signaling, which was mediated by NF-kappaB (p65). MCM8 interacted with DNA-replication-initiating factors-including EZH2, CDC6, and CDCA2-and influenced these factors to associate with chromatin. In addition, MCM8 knockdown increased the sensitivity of GSCs to radiation and TMZ treatments. Our findings suggest that MCM8, regulated by the EGFR pathway, maintains the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of GSCs through interaction with DNA-replication-initiating factors; hence, MCM8 may represent a novel therapeutic target in GBMs.	MCM8 is regulated by EGFR signaling and promotes the growth of glioma stem cells through its interaction with DNA-replication-initiating factors.

34140644	SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) is a multiprotein complex essential for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. SWI/SNF complex genes are genetically altered in over 20% of human malignancies, but the aberrant regulation of the SWI/SNF subunit genes and subsequent dysfunction caused by abnormal expression of subunit gene in cancer, remain poorly understood. Among the SWI/SNF subunit genes, SMARCA4, SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 were identified to be overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modulation of SMARCA4, SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 inhibited in vitro tumorigenesis of HCC cells. However, SMARCA4-targeting elicited remarkable inhibition in an in vivo Ras-transgenic mouse HCC model (Ras-Tg), and high expression levels of SMARCA4 significantly associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, most HCC patients (72-86%) showed SMARCA4 overexpression compared to healthy controls. To identify SMARCA4-specific active enhancers, mapping, and analysis of chromatin state in liver cancer cells were performed. Integrative analysis of SMARCA4-regulated genes and active chromatin enhancers suggested 37 genes that are strongly activated by SMARCA4 in HCC. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and luciferase assays, we demonstrated that SMARCA4 activates Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression through IRAK1 active enhancer in HCC. We then showed that transcriptional activation of IRAK1 induces oncoprotein Gankyrin and aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) in HCC. The regulatory mechanism of the SMARCA4-IRAK1-Gankyrin, AKR1B10 axis was further demonstrated in HCC cells and in vivo Ras-Tg mice. Our results suggest that aberrant overexpression of SMARCA4 causes SWI/SNF to promote IRAK1 enhancer to activate oncoprotein Gankyrin and AKR1B10, thereby contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis.

34140642	As a key cell cycle regulator, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) has been recognized as a crucial factor involved in the progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). However, its regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that Plk1 is a novel substrate of vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2), a serine-threonine kinase that is highly expressed and predicts poor prognosis in PC. VRK2 phosphorylates Plk1 at threonine 210 and protects it from ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. We showed that mechanistically complement factor H-related protein (CFHR), as a major E3 ligase, promotes Plk1 degradation by ubiquitinating it at lysine 209. Phosphorylation of Plk1 at threonine 210 by VRK2 interferes with the interaction of Chfr with Plk1 and antagonizes Plk1 ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the Plk1 protein. Taken together, our data reveal a mechanism of Plk1 overexpression in PC and provide evidence for targeting VRK2 as a potential therapeutic strategy.

34140643	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the specific functions of lncRNAs in alternative splicing (AS) and the metastatic cascade in liver cancer remain largely unclear. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA, LINC01348, which was significantly downregulated in HCC and correlated with survival functions in HCC patients. Ectopic expression of LINC01348 induced marked inhibition of cell growth, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, these phenotypes were reversed upon knockdown of LINC01348. Mechanistically, LINC01348 complexed with splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3B3) acted as a modulator of EZH2 pre-mRNA AS, and induced alterations in JNK/c-Jun activity and expression of Snail. Notably, C-terminal truncated HBx (Ct-HBx) negatively regulated LINC01348 through c-Jun signaling. Our data collectively highlight those novel regulatory associations involving LINC01348/SF3B3/EZH2/JNK/c-Jun/Snail are an important determinant of metastasis in HCC cells and support the potential utility of targeting LINC01348 as a therapeutic strategy for HCC.

34140641	Oxaliplatin (oxa) is widely used in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the development of oxaliplatin resistance is a major obstacle to the therapeutic efficacy in patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous noncoding RNAs measuring between 22 and 24 nucleotides, have been shown to be involved in the development of CRC drug resistance. However, the mechanism by which differentially expressed miRNAs induce chemotherapy resistance in CRC has not been fully elucidated to date. Here, we showed the differentially expressed miRNAs in oxaliplatin-sensitive and oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells through miRNA microarray technology and found that miR-135b-5p was significantly increased in oxaliplatin-resistant cells. And miR-135b-5p was increased in the serum of colorectal cancer patients. More importantly, the miR-135b-5p level in the serum of oxaliplatin-resistant patients was further increased compared to that of oxaliplatin-sensitive patients. Recent studies have shown that protective autophagy is an important mechanism that promotes drug resistance in tumors. The potential role of miR-135b-5p in inducing protective autophagy and promoting oxaliplatin resistance was evaluated in two stable oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines and their parental cells. We further identified MUL1 as a direct downstream target of miR-135b-5p and showed that MUL1 could degrade the key molecule of autophagy, ULK1, through ubiquitination. Mouse xenograft models were adopted to evaluate the correlation between miR-135b-5p and oxaliplatin-induced autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, we also investigated the regulatory factors for the upregulation of miR-135b-5p in CRC cells under oxaliplatin chemotoxicity. These results indicated that miR-135b-5p upregulation in colorectal cancer could induce protective autophagy through the MUL1/ULK1 signaling pathway and promote oxaliplatin resistance. Targeting miR-135b-5p may provide a new treatment strategy for reversing oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.

34145399	Glycolysis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the metastatic tumor microenvironment. A series of lncRNAs have been identified to function as oncogenic molecules by regulating glycolysis. However, the roles of glycolysis-related lncRNAs in regulating colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remain poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of the glycolysis-related lncRNA MIR17HG gradually increased from adjacent normal to CRC to the paired liver metastatic tissues, and high MIR17HG expression predicted poor survival, especially in patients with liver metastasis. Functionally, MIR17HG promoted glycolysis in CRC cells and enhanced their invasion and liver metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MIR17HG functioned as a ceRNA to regulate HK1 expression by sponging miR-138-5p, resulting in glycolysis in CRC cells and leading to their invasion and liver metastasis. More interestingly, lactate accumulated via glycolysis activated the p38/Elk-1 signaling pathway to promote the transcriptional expression of MIR17HG in CRC cells, forming a positive feedback loop, which eventually resulted in persistent glycolysis and the invasion and liver metastasis of CRC cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the lactate-responsive lncRNA MIR17HG, acting as a ceRNA, promotes CRLM through a glycolysis-mediated positive feedback circuit and might be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for CRLM.	LncRNA MIR17HG promotes colorectal cancer liver metastasis by mediating a glycolysis-associated positive feedback circuit.	Oncogene
34148056	Numerous studies suggest an important role for copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer progression. However, CNAs of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in ovarian cancer (OC) and their potential functions have not been fully investigated. Here, based on analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified in this study an oncogenic lincRNA termed LINC00662 that exhibited a significant correlation between its CNA and its increased expression. LINC00662 overexpression is highly associated with malignant features in OC patients and is a prognostic indicator. LINC00662 significantly promotes OC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00662 is stabilized by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1). Moreover, LINC00662 exerts oncogenic effects by interacting with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and preventing its ubiquitination in OC cells, leading to activation of the oncogenic p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results define an oncogenic role for LINC00662 in OC progression mediated via GRP78/p38 signaling, with potential implications regarding therapeutic targets for OC.

34155348	The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been widely used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but the development of acquired resistance remains a therapeutic hurdle. The reduction of glucose uptake has been implicated in the anti-tumor activity of EGFR TKIs. In this study, the upregulation of the active sodium/glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) was found to confer the development of acquired EGFR TKI resistance and was correlated with the poorer clinical outcome of the NSCLC patients who received EGFR TKI treatment. Blockade of SGLT1 overcame this resistance in vitro and in vivo by reducing glucose uptake in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, SGLT1 protein was stabilized through the interaction with PKCdelta-phosphorylated (Thr678) EGFR in the TKI-resistant cells. Our findings revealed that PKCdelta/EGFR axis-dependent SGLT1 upregulation was a critical mechanism underlying the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. We suggest co-targeting PKCdelta/SGLT1 as a potential strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC patients.

34155343	Metastasis is the main cause of death in breast cancer patients. The initial step of metastasis is invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, which enables local breast tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues. However, the molecular mechanism underlying invadopodia-mediated metastasis remains largely unknown. Here we found that the RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1) exhibited elevated expression in invasive breast tumors and promoted lung metastasis of mammary cancer cells. Suppression of Msi1 reduced invadopodia formation in mammary cancer cells. Furthermore, Msi1 deficiency decreased the expression and activity of Mmp9, an important enzyme in ECM degradation. Mechanistically, Msi1 directly suppressed Timp3, an endogenous inhibitor of Mmp9. In clinical breast cancer specimens, TIMP3 and MSI1 levels were significantly inversely correlated both in normal breast tissue and breast cancer tissues and associated with overall survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the MSI1-TIMP3-MMP9 cascade is critical for invadopodia-mediated onset of metastasis in breast cancer, providing novel insights into a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer metastasis.

34163033	The primary chemotherapy of ovarian cancer (OC) often acquires chemoresistance. Sorcin (SRI), a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein, has been reported to be an oncogenic protein in cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of SRI regulation and the role and aberrant expression of SRI in chemoresistant OC remain unclear. Here, we identified SRI as a key driver of paclitaxel (PTX)-resistance and explored its regulatory mechanism. Using transcriptome profiles, qRT-PCR, proteomics, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatics analyses, we found that SRI was overexpressed in PTX-resistant OC cells and the overexpression of SRI was related to the poor prognosis of patients. SRI was a key molecule required for growth, migration, and PTX-resistance in vitro and in vivo and was involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-142-5p directly bound to the 3'-UTR of SRI to suppress its expression, whereas a transcription factor zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) inhibited the transcription of miR-142-5p by directly binding to the E-box fragment in the miR-142 promoter region. Furthermore, ZEB1 was negatively regulated by SRI which physically interacted with Smad4 to block its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel homeostatic loop of SRI that drives the PTX-resistance and malignant progression via Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p in human OC. Targeting this SRI/Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p loop may reverse the PTX-resistance.

34163032	Previous study demonstrated that most long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as competing endogenous RNAs or molecular sponges to negatively modulate miRNA and regulate tumor development. However, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in cancer are not fully understood. Our study describes the role of the lncRNA SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) in cancer metastasis by mechanisms related to Staufen1 (STAU1)-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). Briefly, we found that, high SPRY4-IT1 expression was associated with aggressiveness and poor outcome in human colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, functional assays revealed that SPRY4-IT1 significantly promoted colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, microarray analyses identified several differentially-expressed genes upon SPRY4-IT1 overexpression in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells. Among them, the 3'-UTR of transcription elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1) mRNA can base-pair with the Alu element in the 3'-UTR of SPRY4-IT1. Moreover, SPRY4-IT1 was found to bind STAU1, promote STAU1 recruitment to the 3'-UTR of TCEB1 mRNA, and affect TCEB1 mRNA stability and expression, resulting in hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) upregulation, and thereby affecting cancer cell metastasis. In addition, STAU1 depletion abrogated TCEB1 SMD and alleviated the pro-metastatic effect of SPRY4-IT1 overexpression. Significantly, we revealed that SPRY4-IT1 is also transactivated by NF-kappaB/p65, which activates SPRY4-IT1 to inhibit TCEB1 expression, and subsequently upregulate HIF-1alpha. In conclusion, our results highlight a novel mechanism of cytoplasmic lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 in which SPRY4-IT1 affecting TCEB1 mRNA stability via STAU1-mediated degradation during cancer metastasis.

34158578	Cyclin D1 is an essential regulator of the G1-S cell-cycle transition and is overexpressed in many cancers. Expression of cyclin D1 is under tight cellular regulation that is controlled by many signaling pathways. Here we report that PARP14, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, is a regulator of cyclin D1 expression. Depletion of PARP14 leads to decreased cyclin D1 protein levels. In cells with a functional retinoblastoma (RB) protein pathway, this results in G1 cell-cycle arrest and reduced proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that PARP14 controls cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Using luciferase assays, we show that PARP14 specifically regulates cyclin D1 3'UTR mRNA stability. Finally, we also provide evidence that G1 arrest in PARP14-depleted cells is dependent on an intact p53-p21 pathway. Our work uncovers a new role for PARP14 in promoting cell-cycle progression through both cyclin D1 and the p53 pathway.	PARP14 regulates cyclin D1 expression to promote cell-cycle progression.

34163029	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest cancer mainly owing to its proclivity to early metastasis and the lack of effective targeted therapeutic drugs. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying early invasion and metastasis by PDAC is imperative for improving patient outcomes. The present study identified that upregulation of TSPAN8 expression in PDAC facilitates metastasis in vivo and in vitro. We found SOX9 as a key transcriptional regulator of TSPAN8 expression in response to EGF stimulation. SOX9 modulation was sufficient to positively regulate endogenous expression of TSPAN8, with concomitant in vitro phenotypic changes such as loss of cell-matrix adherence and increased invasion. Moreover, increased SOX9 and TSPAN8 levels were shown to correlate in human pancreatic cancer specimens and downregulated in vitro by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. High expression of SOX9 and TSPAN8 has been associated with tumor stage, poor prognosis and poor patient survival in PDAC. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of the EGF-SOX9-TSPAN8 signaling cascade in the control of PDAC invasion and implies that TSPAN8 may be a promising novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PDAC.	SOX9 is a critical regulator of TSPAN8-mediated metastasis in pancreatic cancer.	Oncogene
34193942	Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells have low or absent tumor cell PD-L1 expression that we previously demonstrated can confer chemotherapy resistance. Here, we demonstrate that PD-L1 depletion enhances JNK activity resulting in increased Bim(Thr116) phosphorylation and its sequestration by MCL-1 and BCL-2. Activated JNK signaling in PD-L1-depeted cells was due to reduced mRNA stability of the CYLD deubiquitinase. PD-L1 was found to compete with the ribonuclease EXOSC10 for binding to CYLD mRNA. Thus, loss of PD-L1 promoted binding and degradation of CYLD mRNA by EXOSC10 which enhanced JNK activity. An irreversible JNK inhibitor (JNK-IN-8) reduced Bim(Thr116) phosphorylation and unsequestered Bim from MCL-1 and BCL-2 to promote apoptosis. In cells lacking PD-L1, treatment with JNK-IN-8, an MCL-1 antagonist (AZD5991), or their combination promoted apoptosis and reduced long-term clonogenic survival by anticancer drugs. Similar effects of the JNK inhibitor on cell viability were observed in CRC organoids with suppression of PD-L1. These data indicate that JNK inhibition may represent a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance in CRC cells with low or absent PD-L1 expression.

34211090	Angiogenesis is essential for the sustained growth of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of angiogenesis and constitutive activation of HIF-1 is frequently observed in human cancers. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms governing the activation of HIF-1 is critical for successful therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis. Herein, we establish a new regulatory mechanism responsible for the constitutive activation of HIF-1alpha in cancer, irrespective of oxygen tension. PIM1 kinase directly phosphorylates HIF-1alpha at threonine 455, a previously uncharacterized site within its oxygen-dependent degradation domain. This phosphorylation event disrupts the ability of prolyl hydroxylases to bind and hydroxylate HIF-1alpha, interrupting its canonical degradation pathway and promoting constitutive transcription of HIF-1 target genes. Moreover, phosphorylation of the analogous site in HIF-2alpha (S435) stabilizes the protein through the same mechanism, indicating post-translational modification within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain as a mechanism of regulating the HIF-alpha subunits. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that expression of PIM1 is sufficient to stabilize HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in normoxia and stimulate angiogenesis in a HIF-1-dependent manner. CRISPR mutants of HIF-1alpha (Thr455D) promoted increased tumor growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Moreover, HIF-1alpha-T455D xenograft tumors were refractory to the anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic effects of PIM inhibitors. These data identify a new signaling axis responsible for hypoxia-independent activation of HIF-1 and expand our understanding of the tumorigenic role of PIM1 in solid tumors.

34211088	Cancer cells show increases in protein degradation pathways, including autophagy, during progression to meet the increased protein degradation demand and support cell survival. On the other hand, reduced autophagy activity during aging is associated with a reduced DNA damage response and increased genomic instability. Therefore, it is a puzzling how DNA repair can be increased in cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapies or during progression when autophagy activity is intact or increased. We discovered that tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44) is a pivotal element regulating the DNA damage response in cancer cells with intact autophagy. TRIM44 deubiquitinates p62, an autophagy substrate, which leads to its oligomerization. This prevents p62 localization to the nucleus upon irradiation. Increased cytoplasmic retention of p62 by TRIM44 prevents the degradation of FLNA and 53BP1, which increases DNA damage repair. Together, our data support TRIM44 a potential therapeutic target for therapy-resistant tumor cells with intact autophagy.

34244607	Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the fourth-most common cancer in women in the United States, and generally carries a favorable prognosis. However, about 10% of EC patients have a rare and aggressive form, uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC), which carries a much higher mortality rate. The developmental transcription factor PAX8 is expressed in nearly 100% of USPCs. We show that PAX8 plays a critical antiapoptotic role in USPC and this role is established via transcriptional activation of two aberrant signaling pathways. First, PAX8 positively regulates mutated p53, and missense p53 mutations have an oncogenic gain of function effect. Second, PAX8 directly transcriptionally regulates p21, in a p53-independent manner, and p21 acquires a growth promoting role that is mediated via cytoplasmic localization of the protein. We propose that mutated p53 and cytoplasmic p21 can independently mediate the pro-proliferative role of PAX8 in USPC. In addition, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to detect pathways that are regulated by PAX8, and propose that metabolism and HIF-1alpha -related pathways are potential candidates for mediating the role of PAX8 in USPC. Taken together our findings demonstrate for the first time that PAX8 is an essential lineage marker in USPC, and suggest its mechanism of action.

34247190	Cancer metastasis causes >90% of cancer deaths and remains a major treatment challenge. Here we deciphered the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of MACC1, a causative driver for cancer metastasis, for cancer cell signaling and novel interventions to restrict cancer metastasis. We identified MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate. MEK1 directly phosphorylates MACC1, leading to accelerated and increased ERK1 activation. Mutating in silico predicted hierarchical MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites abrogates MACC1-induced migration, invasion, and MET expression, a transcriptional MACC1 target. Targeting MEK1 by RNAi or clinically applicable MEK1 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK1120212 reduces MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation and restricts MACC1-induced metastasis formation in mice. Although MEK1 levels, contrary to MACC1, are not of prognostic relevance for CRC patients, MEK1 expression was found indispensable for MACC1-induced metastasis. This study identifies MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation decisively impacting cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. Thus, MAP kinase signaling is not linear leading to ERK activation, but branches at the level of MEK1. This fundamental finding opens new therapeutic options for targeting the MEK1/MACC1 axis as novel vulnerability in patients at high risk for metastasis. This might be extended from CRC to further solid tumor entities.	The newly identified MEK1 tyrosine phosphorylation target MACC1 is druggable by approved MEK1 inhibitors to restrict colorectal cancer metastasis.	Oncogene
34262130	Homologous recombination (HR) repair is an important determinant of chemosensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying HR regulation remain largely unknown. Cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1) is a member of the LIM/double-zinc finger protein family and is overexpressed and associated with prognosis in several tumor types. However, to date, the functional role of CRIP1 in cancer biology is poorly understood. Here we found that CRIP1 downregulation causes HR repair deficiency with concomitant increase in cell sensitivity to cisplatin, epirubicin, and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, upon DNA damage, CRIP1 is deubiquitinated and upregulated by activated AKT signaling. CRIP1, in turn, promotes nuclear enrichment of RAD51, which is a prerequisite step for HR commencement, by stabilizing BRCA2 to counteract FBXO5-targeted RAD51 degradation and by binding to the core domain of RAD51 (RAD51(184-257)) in coordination with BRCA2, to facilitate nuclear export signal masking interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. Moreover, through mass spectrometry screening, we found that KPNA4 is at least one of the carriers controlling the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of the CRIP1-BRCA2-RAD51 complex in response to chemotherapy. Consistent with these findings, RAD51 inhibitors block the CRIP1-mediated HR process, thereby restoring chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer cells with high CRIP1 expression. Analysis of patient specimens revealed an abnormally high level of CRIP1 expression in GC tissues compared to that in the adjacent normal mucosa and a significant negative association between CRIP1 expression and survival time in patient cohorts with different types of solid tumors undergoing genotoxic treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests an essential function of CRIP1 in promoting HR repair and facilitating gastric cancer cell adaptation to genotoxic therapy.	CRIP1 cooperates with BRCA2 to drive the nuclear enrichment of RAD51 and to facilitate homologous repair upon DNA damage induced by chemotherapy.	Oncogene
34274946	Epigenetic alterations have been previously shown to contribute to multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis via DNA methylations and histone modifications. RNA methylation, a novel epigenetic modification, is required for cancer cell survival, and targeting this pathway has been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy. The extent to the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-regulatory pathway functions in MM remains unknown. Here, we show that an imbalance of RNA methylation may underlies the tumorigenesis of MM. Mechanistically, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is highly expressed in CD138(+) cells from MM and its levels appear a progressive increase in the progression of plasma cell dyscrasias. Downregulation of IDH2 increases global m6A RNA levels and reduces myeloma cell growth in vitro, decreases the burden of disease and prolongs overall survival in vivo. IDH2 regulates RNA methylation by activating the RNA demethylase FTO, which is an alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenase. Furthermore, IDH2-mediated FTO activation decreases the m6A level on WNT7B transcripts, then increases WNT7B expression and thus activated Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, survival analysis indicates that the elevated expression of IDH2 predicts a poor prognosis. Higher expression of FTO is related to higher International Staging System (ISS) stage and higher Revised-ISS (R-ISS) stage of MM. Collectively, our studies reveal that IDH2 regulates global m6A RNA modification in MM via targeting RNA demethylases FTO. The imbalance of m6A methylation activates the Wnt signaling pathway by enhancing the WNT7B expression, and thus promoting tumorigenesis and progression of MM. IDH2 might be used as a therapeutic target and a possible prognostic factor for MM.	IDH2 contributes to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis by regulating m6A RNA methylation in multiple myeloma.

34282274	The inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes contributes heavily to oncogenesis. The mutation of TP53 has been well-studied and recognized as a major factor in the development of tumors. Yet other means of p53 inactivation has not been well-elucidated. We previously identified a hypermethylated gene ZDHHC1 that suppresses tumor growth when the expression was restored, but the specific mechanism was yet to be found. The protein product of ZDHHC1 is an S-palmitoyltransferase and we have identified p53 as a substrate for ZDHHC1-mediated palmitoylation, specifically at the C135, C176, and C275 residues. The novel form of post-translational modification of p53 is required for the nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor. p53 recruited DNMT3A to ZDHHC1 promoter and is responsible for the hypermethylation of ZDHHC1. The epigenetic feedback loop formed by ZDHHC1 and p53 sheds light on the inactivation of p53 without the presence of genetic mutations.	Cancer cells escape p53's tumor suppression through ablation of ZDHHC1-mediated p53 palmitoylation.	Oncogene
34294846	K-RAS mutation and molecular alterations of its surrogates function essentially in lung tumorigenesis and malignant progression. However, it remains elusive how tumor-promoting and deleterious events downstream of K-RAS signaling are coordinated in lung tumorigenesis. Here, we show that USP16, a deubiquitinase involved in various biological processes, functions as a promoter for the development of K-RAS-driven lung tumor. Usp16 deletion significantly attenuates K-ras(G12D)-mutation-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. USP16 upregulation upon RAS activation averts reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced p38 activation that would otherwise detrimentally influence the survival and proliferation of tumor cells. In addition, USP16 interacts with and deubiquitinates JAK1, and thereby promoting lung tumor growth by augmenting JAK1 signaling. Therefore, our results reveal that USP16 functions critically in the K-RAS-driven lung tumorigenesis through modulating the strength of p38 and JAK1 signaling.	The deubiquitinase USP16 functions as an oncogenic factor in K-RAS-driven lung tumorigenesis.	Oncogene
34290402	The ARID1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, has been found to be frequently mutated in many human cancer types. However, the function and mechanism of ARID1A in cancer metastasis are still unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of ARID1A increases the ability of breast cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, invade, and metastasize in vivo. The ARID1A-related SWI/SNF complex binds to the second exon of CDH1 and negatively modulates the expression of E-cadherin/CDH1 by recruiting the transcriptional repressor ZEB2 to the CDH1 promoter and excluding the presence of RNA polymerase II. The silencing of CDH1 attenuated the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells in which ARID1A was silenced. ARID1A depletion increased the intracellular enzymatic processing of E-cadherin and the production of C-terminal fragment 2 (CTF2) of E-cadherin, which stabilized beta-catenin by competing for binding to the phosphorylation and degradation complex of beta-catenin. The matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 inhibited the production of CTF2. In zebrafish and nude mice, ARID1A silencing or CTF2 overexpression activated beta-catenin signaling and promoted migration/invasion and metastasis of cancer cells in vivo. The inhibitors GM6001, BB94, and ICG-001 suppressed the migration and invasion of cancer cells with ARID1A-deficiency. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of ARID1A metastasis and offer a scientific basis for targeted therapy of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells.

34294845	Research has indicated that hypoxia profoundly contributes to chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer (PC), while the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report a hypoxic exosomal circular RNA (circRNA)-mediated mechanism of conferred chemoresistance in PC cells. Gemcitabine (GEM) resistance was enhanced in normoxic PC cells incubated with exosomes derived from hypoxic PC cells. CircRNA microarray displayed that circZNF91 was remarkably increased in hypoxic exosomes of PC cells compared with normoxic exosomes. Overexpression of circZNF91 obviously stimulated chemoresistance in PC cells, while knockdown of circZNF91 retarded the hypoxic exosome-transmitted chemoresistance. Mechanistically, the hypoxic-induced exosomal circZNF91 transmitted into normoxic PC cells could competitively bind to miR-23b-3p, which deprives the inhibition of miR-23b-3p on expression of deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Consequently, the upregulated SIRT1 enhanced deacetylation-dependent stability of HIF-1alpha protein, leading to glycolysis and GEM chemoresistance of recipient PC cells. In addition, we revealed that the increased circZNF91 in hypoxic exosome was attributed to the transcriptional regulation by HIF-1alpha. Coincidently, transmission of hypoxic exosomes into subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice obviously facilitated the chemoresistance of transplanted PC tumor, which could be reversed by depletion of circZNF91 or upregulation of miR-23b-3p. Furthermore, clinical data showed that circZNF91 was significantly upregulated in PC tissues and correlated with overexpression of glycolytic enzymes and short overall survival time. Collectively, exosomal circZNF91 can function as a cargo mediating the signal transmission between hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells to promote GEM chemoresistance of PC and may potentially serve as a therapeutic target.	Hypoxic exosomal HIF-1alpha-stabilizing circZNF91 promotes chemoresistance of normoxic pancreatic cancer cells via enhancing glycolysis.	Oncogene
34316028	B-Myb is an important transcription factor that plays a critical role in gene expression regulation and tumorigenesis. However, its functional implication in colorectal cancer remains elusive. In this study, we found that B-Myb was significantly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in colorectal cancer samples compared to non-tumor counterparts. B-Myb overexpression accelerated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell motility in colorectal cancer cells, and promoted tumor growth in orthotopic nude mouse models in vivo. In contrast, B-Myb depletion inhibited these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that E2F2 was a novel transcriptional target of B-Myb and is essential to B-Myb-induced malignant phenotypes. Notably, B-Myb and E2F2 exhibited positive expression correlation, and interacted with each other in colorectal cancer cells. In addition to their autoregulatory mechanisms, B-Myb and E2F2 can also directly transactivate each other, thus constituting consolidated reciprocal feed-forward transactivation loops. Moreover, both B-Myb and E2F2 are required for the activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways in colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, our data clarified a critical role for B-Myb in colorectal cancer and unraveled an exquisite mutual collaboration and reciprocal cross regulation between B-Myb and E2F2 that contribute to the malignant progression of human colorectal cancer.

34321603	We identified fermitin family member 2 (FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2) as a potential target in A375 cell line by siRNA library screening. Drugs that target mutant BRAF kinase lack durable efficacy in the treatment of melanoma because of acquired resistance, thus the identification of novel therapeutic targets is needed. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify kindlin-2 expression in melanoma samples. The interaction between kindlin-2 and Rac1 or p-Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6 (alpha-Pix) was investigated. Finally, the tumor suppressive role of kindlin-2 was validated in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of clinical samples and Oncomine data showed that higher levels of kindlin-2 predicted a more advanced T stage and M stage and facilitated metastasis and recurrence. Kindlin-2 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma growth and migration, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression had the inverse effects. Further study showed that kindlin-2 could specifically bind to p-alpha-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to induce a switch from the inactive Rac1-GDP conformation to the active Rac1-GTP conformation and then stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Moreover, we revealed that a Rac1 inhibitor suppressed melanoma growth and metastasis and the combination of the Rac1 inhibitor and vemurafenib resulted in a better therapeutic outcome than monotherapy in melanoma with high kindlin-2 expression and BRAF mutation. Our results demonstrated that kindlin-2 promoted melanoma progression, which was attributed to specific binding to p-alpha-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Thus, kindlin-2 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating melanoma.

34312488	N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent epigenetic RNA modification and is vital in regulating malignancies. The roles of m(6)A modifiers on noncoding RNAs have not been fully investigated in esophageal cancer. By screening all m(6)A modifiers, ALKBH5 was the most potent member related to patient outcomes and suppressing esophageal cancer malignancy in cell and animal models. It demethylated pri-miR-194-2 and inhibited miR-194-2 biogenesis through an m(6)A/DGCR8-dependent manner. RAI1, previously considered as a circadian clock transcriptional regulator, was the main target of miR-194-2. It enhanced transcription of Hippo pathway upstream genes by binding to their 3'UTR and suppressed YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. The ALKBH5/miR-194-2/RAI1 axis was also validated in clinical samples. In addition, the increased malignancy by low ALKBH5 was abolished by the YAP inhibitor verteporfin. Our findings uncover a critical role of ALKBH5 in miRNAs biogenesis and provide novel insight for developing treatment strategies in esophageal cancer.

34321604	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to exert important roles in tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). PVT1 is an important oncogenic lncRNA which has critical effects on onset and development of various cancers, however, the underlying mechanism of PVT1 functioning in ccRCC remains largely unknown. VHL deficiency-induced HIF2alpha accumulation is one of the major factors for ccRCC. Here, we identified the potential molecular mechanism of PVT1 in promoting ccRCC development by stabilizing HIF2alpha. PVT1 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and high PVT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of ccRCC patients. Both gain-of-function and loss-of function experiments revealed that PVT1 enhanced ccRCC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PVT1 interacted with HIF2alpha protein and enhanced its stability by protecting it from ubiquitination-dependent degradation, thereby exerting its biological significance. Meanwhile, HIF2alpha bound to the enhancer of PVT1 to transactivate its expression. Furthermore, HIF2alpha specific inhibitor could repress PVT1 expression and its oncogenic functions. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the PVT1/ HIF2alpha positive feedback loop involves in tumorigenesis and progression of ccRCC, which may be exploited for anticancer therapy.	Positive feedback regulation of lncRNA PVT1 and HIF2alpha contributes to clear cell renal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis and metastasis.	Oncogene
34304250	We have previously reported that the differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1), a compound identified in Dictyostelium discoideum, suppresses the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inactivating p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70(S6K)). Therefore, we first examined whether the same mechanism operates in other breast cancer cells, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and refractory phenotype of breast cancer. We also investigated the mechanism by which DIF-1 suppresses p70(S6K) by focusing on the AMPK-mTORC1 system. We found that DIF-1 induces phosphorylation of AMPK and Raptor and dephosphorylation of p70(S6K) in multiple TNBC cell lines. Next, we examined whether AMPK-mediated inhibition of p70(S6K) leads to the suppression of proliferation and migration/infiltration of TNBC cells. DIF-1 significantly reduced the expression levels of cyclin D1 by suppressing the translation of STAT3 and strongly suppressed the expression levels of Snail, which led to the suppression of growth and motility, respectively. Finally, we investigated whether DIF-1 exerts anticancer effects on TNBC in vivo. Intragastric administration of DIF-1 suppressed tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis of 4T1-Luc cells injected into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. DIF-1 is expected to lead to the development of anticancer drugs, including anti-TNBC, by a novel mechanism.

34326467	"Metastatic breast cancer causes most breast cancer-associated deaths, especially in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). The metastatic drivers of TNBCs are still poorly understood, and effective treatment non-existent. Here we reveal that the presence of Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA) in the nucleus and metastatic dissemination are molecularly connected through HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1) signaling. Nuclear AURKA activates transcription of ""hypoxia-induced genes"" under normoxic conditions (pseudohypoxia) and without upregulation of oxygen-sensitive HIF1A subunit. We uncover that AURKA preferentially binds to HIF1B and co-localizes with the HIF complex on DNA. The mass-spectrometry analysis of the AURKA complex further confirmed the presence of CBP and p300 along with other TFIIB/RNApol II components. Importantly, the expression of multiple HIF-dependent genes induced by nuclear AURKA (N-AURKA), including migration/invasion, survival/death, and stemness, promote early cancer dissemination. These results indicate that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, AURKA is a novel driver of early metastasis. Analysis of clinical tumor specimens revealed a correlation between N-AURKA presence and decreased patient survival. Our results establish a mechanistic link between two critical pathways in cancer metastasis, identifying nuclear AURKA as a crucial upstream regulator of the HIF1 transcription complex and a target for anti-metastatic therapy."

34331012	Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths primarily due to its inherent potential of therapy resistance. Checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents when used in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapies. Recent studies have highlighted a critical role of the Greatwall kinase (microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase-like (MASTL)) in promoting oncogenic malignancy and resistance to anti-cancer therapies; however, its role in PC remains unknown. Based on a comprehensive investigation involving PC patient samples, murine models of PC progression (Kras;PdxCre-KC and Kras;p53;PdxCre-KPC), and loss and gain of function studies, we report a previously undescribed critical role of MASTL in promoting cancer malignancy and therapy resistance. Mechanistically, MASTL promotes PC by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor protein stability and, thereupon, kinase signaling. We further demonstrate that combinatorial therapy targeting MASTL promotes the efficacy of the cell-killing effects of Gemcitabine using both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions. Taken together, this study identifies a key role of MASTL in promoting PC progression and its utility as a novel target in promoting sensitivity to the anti-PC therapies.

34333551	Cancer cells exhibit dysregulation of critical genes including those involved in lipid biosynthesis, with subsequent defects in metabolism. Here, we show that ELOngation of Very Long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of very-long polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3, >/=28 C), is expressed and transcriptionally repressed by the oncogene MYCN in neuroblastoma cells. In keeping, ELOVL4 positively regulates neuronal differentiation and lipids droplets accumulation in neuroblastoma cells. At the molecular level we found that MYCN binds to the promoter of ELOVL4 in close proximity to the histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2, and the transcription factor Sp1 that can cooperate in the repression of ELOVL4 expression. Accordingly, in vitro differentiation results in an increase of fatty acid with 34 carbons with 6 double bonds (FA34:6); and when MYCN is silenced, FA34:6 metabolite is increased compared with the scrambled. In addition, analysis of large neuroblastoma datasets revealed that ELOVL4 expression is highly expressed in localized clinical stages 1 and 2, and low in high-risk stages 3 and 4. More importantly, high expression of ELOVL4 stratifies a subsets of neuroblastoma patients with good prognosis. Indeed, ELOVL4 expression is a marker of better overall clinical survival also in MYCN not amplified patients and in those with neuroblastoma-associated mutations. In summary, our findings indicate that MYCN, by repressing the expression of ELOVL4 and lipid metabolism, contributes to the progression of neuroblastoma.	The expression of ELOVL4, repressed by MYCN, defines neuroblastoma patients with good outcome.	Oncogene
34331014	Metastatic recurrence is still a major challenge in breast cancer treatment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that a small adaptor protein, SH3BGRL, is upregulated in the majority of breast cancer patients, especially elevated in those with metastatic relapse, indicating it as a marker for the poor prognosis of breast cancer. Physiologically, SH3BGRL can multifunctionally promote breast cancer cell tumorigenicity, migration, invasiveness, and efficient lung colonization in nude mice. Mechanistically, SH3BGRL downregulates the acting-binding protein profilin 1 (PFN1) by accelerating the translation of the PFN1 E3 ligase, STUB1 via SH3BGRL interaction with ribosomal proteins, or/and enhancing the interaction of PFN1 with STUB1 to accelerate PFN1 degradation. Loss of PFN1 consequently contributes to downstream multiple activations of AKT, NF-kB, and WNT signaling pathways. In contrast, the forced expression of compensatory PFN1 in SH3BGRL-high cells efficiently neutralizes SH3BGRL-induced metastasis and tumorigenesis with PTEN upregulation and PI3K-AKT signaling inactivation. Clinical analysis validates that SH3BGRL expression is negatively correlated with PFN1 and PTEN levels, but positively to the activations of AKT, NF-kB, and WNT signaling pathways in breast patient tissues. Our results thus suggest that SH3BGRL is a valuable prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for preventing breast cancer progression and metastasis.

34341514	Anoikis is a type of programmed cell death induced by loss of anchorage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis resistance (AR) is crucial for the survival of metastatic cancer cells in blood, lymphatic circulation and distant organs. Compared to ordinary cancer cells, anoikis resistant cancer cells undergo various cellular and molecular alterations, probably characterizing the cells with unique features not limited to anoikis resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms connecting anoikis resistance to other metastatic properties are still poorly understood. Here, the biological interaction between anoikis resistance and angiogenesis as well as their involvement into peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The prognostic value of key components involved in this interaction was evaluated in the GC cohort. Compared to ordinary GC cells, GC(AR) cells exhibited stronger metastatic and pro-angiogenic traits corresponding to elevated PDGFB secretion. Mechanistically, transcription factor C/EBPbeta facilitated PDGFB transcription by directly binding to and interacting with PDGFB promoter elements, subsequently increasing PDGFB secretion. Secreted PDGFB promoted the survival of detached GC cells through a C/EBPbeta-dependent self-feedback loop. Moreover, secreted PDGFB promoted angiogenesis in metastases via activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in vascular endothelial cells. Both C/EBPbeta activation level and PDGFB expression were significantly elevated in GC and correlated with metastatic progression and poor prognosis of patients with GC. Overall, interaction between GC(AR) cells and vascular endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis and peritoneal metastasis of GC based on C/EBPbeta-mediated PDGFB autocrine and paracrine signaling. C/EBPbeta-PDGFB-PDGFRbeta-MAPK axis promises to be potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for peritoneal metastasis of GC.

34341513	Expression of beta-crystallin B2 (CRYbetaB2) is elevated in African American (AA) breast tumors. The underlying mechanisms of CRYbetaB2-induced malignancy and the association of CRYbetaB2 protein expression with survival have not yet been described. Here, we report that the expression of CRYbetaB2 in breast cancer cells increases stemness, growth, and metastasis. Transcriptomics data revealed that CRYbetaB2 upregulates genes that are functionally associated with unfolded protein response, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair, while down-regulating genes related to apoptosis. CRYbetaB2 in tumors promotes de-differentiation, an increase in mesenchymal markers and cancer-associated fibroblasts, and enlargement of nucleoli. Proteome microarrays identified a direct interaction between CRYbetaB2 and the nucleolar protein, nucleolin. CRYbetaB2 induces nucleolin, leading to the activation of AKT and EGFR signaling. CRISPR studies revealed a dependency on nucleolin for the pro-tumorigenic effects of CRYbetaB2. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts with upregulated CRYbetaB2 are distinctively sensitive to the nucleolin aptamer, AS-1411. Lastly, in AA patients, higher levels of nucleolar CRYbetaB2 in primary TNBC correlates with decreased survival. In summary, CRYbetaB2 is upregulated in breast tumors of AA patients and induces oncogenic alterations consistent with an aggressive cancer phenotype. CRYbetaB2 increases sensitivity to nucleolin inhibitors and may promote breast cancer disparity.	CRYbetaB2 enhances tumorigenesis through upregulation of nucleolin in triple negative breast cancer.

34345014	RING finger proteins (RNFs) play a critical role in cancer initiation and progression. RNF141 is a member of RNFs family; however, its clinical significance, roles, and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the expression of RNF141 in 64 pairs of CRC and adjacent normal tissues by real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. We found that there was more expression of RNF141 in CRC tissue compared with its adjacent normal tissue and high RNF141 expression associated with T stage. In vivo and in vitro functional experiments were conducted and revealed the oncogenic role of RNF141 in CRC. RNF141 knockdown suppressed proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase, inhibited migration, invasion and HUVEC tube formation but promoted apoptosis, whereas RNF141 overexpression exerted the opposite effects in CRC cells. The subcutaneous xenograft models showed that RNF141 knockdown reduced tumor growth, but its overexpression promoted tumor growth. Mechanistically, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry indicated RNF141 interacted with KRAS, which was confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence assay. Further analysis with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays showed that RNF141 could directly bind to KRAS. Importantly, the upregulation of RNF141 increased GTP-bound KRAS, but its knockdown resulted in a reduction accordingly. Next, we demonstrated that RNF141 induced KRAS activation via increasing its enrichment on the plasma membrane not altering total KRAS expression, which was facilitated by the interaction with LYPLA1. Moreover, KRAS silencing partially abolished the effect of RNF141 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, our findings presented that RNF141 functioned as an oncogene by upregulating KRAS activity in a manner of promoting KRAS enrichment on the plasma membrane in CRC.

34345015	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Though advances in diagnosis and treatment have prolonged overall survival (OS) for patients with breast cancer, metastasis remains the major obstacles to improved survival for breast cancer patients. The existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) is a major reason underlying cancer metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, understanding the molecular pathways sustaining BCSC properties and targeting BCSCs will ultimately improve breast cancer treatments. In this study, we found that activation of beta-Catenin directly regulated CCL2 expression at the transcriptional level, and in turn promoted macrophages infiltration and M2 polarization. Moreover, macrophages co-cultured with breast cancer cells showed a significant increase in CCL2 expression and promoted beta-Catenin-induced BCSCs properties, whereas depletion of CCL2 by adding neutralizing antibodies suppressed BSCSs properties. In addition, we found that beta-Catenin-mediated CCL2 secretion recruited macrophages into tumor microenvironment and promoted breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. Clinically, we observed a significant positive correlation between beta-Catenin, CCL2 and CD163 expression, and increased expression of beta-Catenin, CCL2 and CD163 predicted poor prognosis in breast cancer. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 and beta-Catenin synergistically suppressed BCSC properties and breast cancer growth. Collectively, our findings suggested that beta-Catenin-mediated CCL2 secretion forms a paracrine feedback loop between breast cancer cells and macrophages, which in turn promotes BCSC properties and supports breast cancer growth and metastasis. Targeting beta-Catenin/CCL2 signaling might be an effective strategy for breast cancer therapy.	beta-Catenin-CCL2 feedback loop mediates crosstalk between cancer cells and macrophages that regulates breast cancer stem cells.

34345013	Emerging evidence suggests that the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key culprits of cancer metastasis and drug resistance. Understanding mechanisms regulating the critical oncogenic pathways and CSCs function could reveal new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We now report that miR-22, a miRNA critical for hair follicle stem/progenitor cell differentiation, promotes tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis by maintaining Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and CSCs function. Mechanistically, we find that miR-22 facilitates beta-catenin stabilization through directly repressing citrullinase PAD2. Moreover, miR-22 also relieves DKK1-mediated repression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by targeting a FosB-DDK1 transcriptional axis. miR-22 knockout mice showed attenuated Wnt/beta-catenin activity and Lgr5(+) CSCs penetrance, resulting in reduced occurrence, progression, and metastasis of chemically induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Clinically, miR-22 is abundantly expressed in human cSCC. Its expression is even further elevated in the CSCs proportion, which negatively correlates with PAD2 and FosB expression. Inhibition of miR-22 markedly suppressed cSCC progression and increased chemotherapy sensitivity in vitro and in xenograft mice. Together, our results revealed a novel miR-22-WNT-CSCs regulatory mechanism in cSCC and highlight the important clinical application prospects of miR-22, a common target molecule for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and CSCs, for patient stratification and therapeutic intervention.	miR-22 promotes stem cell traits via activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

34349244	Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is a tumor suppressor downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, two of the fastest rising cancers worldwide. We compared MATalpha1 (protein encoded by MAT1A) interactome in normal versus cancerous livers by mass spectrometry to reveal interactions with 14-3-3zeta. The MATalpha1/14-3-3zeta complex was critical for the expression of 14-3-3zeta. Similarly, the knockdown and small molecule inhibitor for 14-3-3zeta (BV02), and ChIP analysis demonstrated the role of 14-3-3zeta in suppressing MAT1A expression. Interaction between MATalpha1 and 14-3-3zeta occurs directly and is enhanced by AKT2 phosphorylation of MATalpha1. Blocking their interaction enabled nuclear MATalpha1 translocation and inhibited tumorigenesis. In contrast, overexpressing 14-3-3zeta lowered nuclear MATalpha1 levels and promoted tumor progression. However, tumor-promoting effects of 14-3-3zeta were eliminated when liver cancer cells expressed mutant MATalpha1 unable to interact with 14-3-3zeta. Taken together, the reciprocal negative regulation that MATalpha1 and 14-3-3zeta exert is a key mechanism in liver tumorigenesis.

34345012	5-Methylcytosine (m(5)C) is a posttranscriptional RNA modification participating in many critical bioprocesses, but its functions in human cancer remain unclear. Here, by detecting the transcriptome-wide m(5)C profiling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we showed increased m(5)C methylation in ESCC tumors due to the overexpressed m(5)C methyltransferase NSUN2. Aberrant expression of NSUN2 was positively regulated by E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1). High NSUN2 levels predicted poor survival of ESCC patients. Moreover, silencing NSUN2 suppressed ESCC tumorigenesis and progression in Nsun2 knockout mouse models. Mechanistically, NSUN2 induced m(5)C modification of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and stabilized its mRNA, which was mediated by a novel m(5)C mediator, protein lin-28 homolog B (LIN28B). Elevated GRB2 levels increased the activation of PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signalling. These results demonstrate that NSUN2 enhances the initiation and progression of ESCC via m(5)C-LIN28B dependent stabilization of GRB2 transcript, providing a promising epitranscriptomic-targeted therapeutic strategy for ESCC.

34363022	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis and an important tumor suppressor in human malignancies. Here, we aimed to investigate the expression profile of FBP1 in ovarian cancer, the molecular mechanisms that regulate FBP1 expression and to examine how the FBP1 regulatory axis contributes to tumorigenesis and progression in ovarian cancer. We showed that FBP1 expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues, and low-FBP1 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. The enhanced expression of FBP1 in ovarian cancer cell lines suppressed proliferation and 2-D/3-D invasion, reduced aerobic glycolysis, and sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, DNA methylation and C-MYC binding at the promoter inhibited FBP1 expression. Furthermore, through physical interactions with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), FBP1 suppressed nuclear translocation of STAT3 and exerted its non-metabolic enzymatic activity to induce the dysfunction of STAT3. Thus, our study suggests that FBP1 may be a valuable prognostic predictor for ovarian cancer. C-MYC-dependent downregulation of FBP1 acted as a tumor suppressor via modulating STAT3, and the C-MYC/FBP1/STAT3 axis could be a therapeutic target.

34373577	The activity of Rho family GTPase protein, RAC1, which plays important normal physiological functions, is dysregulated in multiple cancers. RAC1 is expressed in both estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer (BC) cells. However, ER-positive BC is more sensitive to RAC1 inhibition. We have determined that reducing RAC1 activity, using siRNA or EHT 1864 (a small molecule Rac inhibitor), leads to rapid ER protein degradation. RAC1 interacts with ER within the ER complex and RAC1 localizes to chromatin binding sites for ER upon estrogen treatment. RAC1 activity is important for RNA Pol II function at both promoters and enhancers of ER target genes and ER-regulated gene transcription is blocked by EHT 1864, in a dose-dependent manner. Having identified that RAC1 is an essential ER cofactor for ER protein stability and ER transcriptional activity, we report that RAC1 inhibition could be an effective therapeutic approach for ER-positive BC.	RAC1 plays an essential role in estrogen receptor alpha function in breast cancer cells.	Oncogene
34489549	Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and extremely aggressive type of thyroid cancer, and the potential mechanisms involved in ATC progression remains unclarified. In this study, we found that forkhead box K2 (FOXK2) was upregulated in ATC tissues, and the expression of FOXK2 was associated with tumor size. Evidenced by RNA-seq and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq assays, FOXK2 positively regulated VEGF and VEGFR signaling network, among which only VEGFA could be noticed in both RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results. ChIP, dual-luciferase reporter system and functional experiments further confirmed that FOXK2 promoted angiogenesis by inducing the transcription of VEGFA. On VEGFR2 blockage by specific targeting agent, such as Apatinib, FOXK2 could rapidly trigger therapeutic resistance. Mechanical analyses revealed that VEGFA transcriptionally induced by FOXK2 could bind to VEGFR1 as a compensation for VEGFR2 blockage, which promoted angiogenesis by activating ERK, PI3K/AKT and P38/MAPK signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Synergic effect on anti-angiogenesis could be observed when VEGFR1 suppressor AF321 was included in VEGFR2 inhibition system, which clarified the pivot role of FOXK2 in VEGFR2 targeting therapy resistance. More importantly, the binding of VEGFA to VEGFR1 could further promoter FOXK2-mediated VEGFA transcription, which consequently constituted a positive feedback loop. Therefore, the novel loop VEGFA/VEGFR1/FOXK2 functioned importantly in resistance to VEGFR2 targeting therapy in FOXK2(+) ATCs. Altogether, FOXK2 plays critical roles in ATC angiogenesis and VEGFR2 blockage resistance by inducing VEGFA transcription. FOXK2 represents a potentially new therapeutic strategy and biomarker for anti-angiogenic therapy against ATC.	FOXK2 transcriptionally activating VEGFA induces apatinib resistance in anaplastic thyroid cancer through VEGFA/VEGFR1 pathway.	Oncogene
34465901	The PBAF complex, a member of SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, plays an essential role in transcriptional regulation. We revealed a disease progression associated elevation of PHF10 subunit of PBAF in clinical melanoma samples. In melanoma cell lines, PHF10 interacts with MYC and facilitates the recruitment of PBAF complex to target gene promoters, therefore, augmenting MYC transcriptional activation of genes involved in the cell cycle progression. Depletion of either PHF10 or MYC induced G1 accumulation and a senescence-like phenotype. Our data identify PHF10 as a pro-oncogenic mechanism and an essential novel link between chromatin remodeling and MYC-dependent gene transcription.

34511598	MAP4K4 is a Ste20 member and reported to play important roles in various pathologies, including in cancer. However, the mechanism by which MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer is not fully understood. It is suggested that MAP4K4 might function as a cancer promoter via specific downstream target(s) in an organ-specific manner. Here we identified MLK3 as a direct downstream target of MAP4K4. The MAP4K4 and MLK3 associates with each other, and MAP4K4 phosphorylates MLK3 on Thr738 and increases MLK3 kinase activity and downstream signaling. The phosphorylation of MLK3 by MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Moreover, MAP4K4 is overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors and directly correlates with the disease progression. The MAP4K4-specific pharmacological inhibitor, GNE-495, impedes pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, induces cell death, and arrests cell cycle progression. Additionally, the GNE-495 reduced the tumor burden and extended survival of the KPC mice with pancreatic cancer. The MAP4K4 inhibitor also reduced MAP4K4 protein expression, tumor stroma, and induced cell death in murine pancreatic tumors. These findings collectively suggest that MLK3 phosphorylation by MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer, and therefore therapies targeting MAP4K4 might alleviate the pancreatic cancer tumor burden in patients.

34535770	Liver metastasis (LM) severely affects gastric cancer (GC) patients' prognosis. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play key roles in intercellular communication. Specific sEV-miRNAs from several types of cancer were found to induce a premetastatic niche in target organs before tumor cell arrive. However, whether the primary GC affects hepatic microenvironment or the role of sEV-miRNAs in GC-LM is yet unclear. We report that GC-derived sEVs are primarily absorbed by Kupffer cells (KCs). sEV-miR-151a-3p is highly expressed in GC-LM patients' plasma and presents poor prognosis. Treating mice with sEVs-enriched in miR-151a-3p promotes GC-LM, whereas has no influence on the proliferation of GC cells in situ. Mechanistically, sEV-miR-151a-3p inhibits SP3 in KCs. Simultaneously, sEV-miR-151a-3p targets YTHDF3 to decrease the transcriptional inhibitory activity of SP3 by reducing SUMO1 translation in a N6-methyladenosine-dependent manner. These factors contribute to TGF-beta1 transactivation in KCs, subsequently activating the SMAD2/3 pathway and enhancing the stem cell-like properties of incoming GC cells. Furthermore, sEV-miR-151a-3p induces miR-151a-3p transcription in KCs to form a positive feedback loop. In summary, our results reveal a previously unidentified regulatory axis initiated by sEV-miR-151a-3p that establishes a hepatic stemness-permissive niche to support GC-LM. sEV-miR-151a-3p could be a promising diagnostic biomarker and preventive treatment candidate for GC-LM.	miR-151a-3p-rich small extracellular vesicles derived from gastric cancer accelerate liver metastasis via initiating a hepatic stemness-enhancing niche.

32371497	"High rates of glycolysis in cancer cells are a well-established characteristic of many human tumors, providing rapidly proliferating cancer cells with metabolites that can be used as precursors for anabolic pathways. Maintenance of high glycolytic rates depends on the lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed regeneration of NAD(+) from GAPDH-generated NADH because an increased NADH:NAD(+) ratio inhibits GAPDH. Here, using human breast cancer cell models, we identified a pathway in which changes in the extramitochondrial-free NADH:NAD(+) ratio signaled through the CtBP family of NADH-sensitive transcriptional regulators to control the abundance and activity of p53. NADH-free forms of CtBPs cooperated with the p53-binding partner HDM2 to suppress p53 function, and loss of these forms in highly glycolytic cells resulted in p53 accumulation. We propose that this pathway represents a ""glycolytic stress response"" in which the initiation of a protective p53 response by an increased NADH:NAD(+) ratio enables cells to avoid cellular damage caused by mismatches between metabolic supply and demand."	p53 is regulated by aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells by the CtBP family of NADH-dependent transcriptional regulators.

32398349	Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that dictates whether cells survive or die in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory stimuli. The activity of RIPK1 is tightly controlled by multiple posttranslational modification mechanisms, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Here, we report that sensitivity to TNF-induced, RIPK1-dependent cell death was tunable by the pH environment. We found that an acidic extracellular pH, which led to a concomitant decrease in intracellular pH, impaired the kinase activation of RIPK1 and autophosphorylation at Ser(166) Consequently, formation of the cytosolic death-inducing complex II and subsequent RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis were inhibited. By contrast, low pH did not affect the formation of membrane-anchored TNFR1-containing signaling complex (complex I), RIPK1 ubiquitination, and NF-kappaB activation. TNF-induced cell death in Ripk1 (-/-) cells was not sensitive to pH changes. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved His(151) abolished the pH dependence of RIPK1 activation, suggesting that this histidine residue functions as a proton acceptor to modulate RIPK1 activity in response to pH changes. These results revealed an unexpected environmental factor that controls the death-inducing activity of RIPK1.	The death-inducing activity of RIPK1 is regulated by the pH environment.

32457115	The suppression of bone formation is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells inhibit osteoblastogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can also differentiate into adipocytes. We investigated myeloma-MSC interactions and the effects of such interactions on the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes or osteoblasts using single-cell RNA sequencing, in vitro coculture, and subcutaneous injection of MSCs and myeloma cells into mice. Our results revealed that the alpha4 integrin subunit on myeloma cells stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) on MSCs, leading to the activation of protein kinase C beta1 (PKCbeta1) signaling and repression of the muscle ring-finger protein-1 (MURF1)-mediated ubiquitylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2). Stabilized PPARgamma2 proteins enhanced adipogenesis and consequently reduced osteoblastogenesis from MSCs, thus suppressing bone formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal that suppressed bone formation is a direct consequence of myeloma-MSC contact that promotes the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts. Thus, this study provides a potential strategy for treating bone resorption in patients with myeloma by counteracting tumor-MSC interactions.	Myeloma cells shift osteoblastogenesis to adipogenesis by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase MURF1 in mesenchymal stem cells.	Science signaling
32606037	N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (NMDARs) containing GluN2B subunits are prevalent early after birth in most brain regions in rodents. Upon synapse maturation, GluN2B is progressively removed from synapses, which affects NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity. Aberrant recruitment of GluN2B into mature synapses has been implicated in several neuropathologies that afflict adults. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b was enriched in the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons of mice and rats and suppressed GluN2B abundance during development and inflammatory pain. Cbl-b abundance increased from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, a critical time period for synapse maturation. Through its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, Cbl-b interacted with GluN2B. Ubiquitination of GluN2B by Cbl-b decreased the synaptic transmission mediated by GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Knocking down Cbl-b in vivo during P1 to P14 led to sustained retention of GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses, suggesting that Cbl-b limits the synaptic abundance of GluN2B in adult mice. However, peripheral inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in the dephosphorylation of Cbl-b at Tyr(363), which impaired its binding to and ubiquitylation of GluN2B, enabling the reappearance of GluN2B-containing NMDARs at synapses. Expression of a phosphomimic Cbl-b mutant in the dorsal horn suppressed both GluN2B-mediated synaptic currents and manifestations of pain induced by inflammation. The findings indicate a ubiquitin-mediated developmental switch in NMDAR subunit composition that is dysregulated by inflammation, which can enhance nociception.

32636307	Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) is an important metalloproteinase that synchronizes growth factor activation with extracellular matrix assembly during morphogenesis and tissue repair. The mechanisms by which BMP-1 exerts these effects are highly context dependent. Because BMP-1 overexpression induces marked phenotypic changes in two human cell lines (HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells), we investigated how BMP-1 simultaneously affects cell-matrix interactions and growth factor activity in these cells. Increasing BMP-1 led to a loss of cell adhesion that depended on the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). BMP-1 cleaved TSP-1 between the VWFC/procollagen-like domain and the type 1 repeats that mediate several key TSP-1 functions. This cleavage induced the release of TSP-1 C-terminal domains from the extracellular matrix and abolished its previously described multisite cooperative interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and CD36 on HT1080 cells. In addition, BMP-1-dependent proteolysis potentiated the TSP-1-mediated activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), leading to increased signaling through the canonical SMAD pathway. In primary human corneal stromal cells (keratocytes), endogenous BMP-1 cleaved TSP-1, and the addition of exogenous BMP-1 enhanced cleavage, but this had no substantial effect on cell adhesion. Instead, processed TSP-1 promoted the differentiation of keratocytes into myofibroblasts and stimulated production of the myofibroblast marker alpha-SMA, consistent with the presence of processed TSP-1 in human corneal scars. Our results indicate that BMP-1 can both trigger the disruption of cell adhesion and stimulate TGF-beta signaling in TSP-1-rich microenvironments, which has important potential consequences for wound healing and tumor progression.	BMP-1 disrupts cell adhesion and enhances TGF-beta activation through cleavage of the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1.	Science signaling
32723812	Mitochondria are signaling hubs in eukaryotic cells. Here, we showed that the mitochondrial FUN14 domain-containing protein-1 (FUNDC1), an effector of Parkin-independent mitophagy, also participates in cellular plasticity by sustaining oxidative bioenergetics, buffering ROS production, and supporting cell proliferation. Targeting this pathway in cancer cells suppressed tumor growth but rendered transformed cells more motile and invasive in a manner dependent on ROS-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial repositioning to the cortical cytoskeleton. Global metabolomics and proteomics profiling identified a FUNDC1 interactome at the mitochondrial inner membrane, comprising the AAA+ protease, LonP1, and subunits of oxidative phosphorylation, complex V (ATP synthase). Independently of its previously identified role in mitophagy, FUNDC1 enabled LonP1 proteostasis, which in turn preserved complex V function and decreased ROS generation. Therefore, mitochondrial reprogramming by a FUNDC1-LonP1 axis controls tumor cell plasticity by switching between proliferative and invasive states in cancer.	The mitophagy effector FUNDC1 controls mitochondrial reprogramming and cellular plasticity in cancer cells.	Science signaling
32788341	Chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), notably the branch comprising the kinase PERK and the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha, is a pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding. Partial reduction of UPR signaling at the level of phosphorylated eIF2alpha is neuroprotective and avoids the pancreatic toxicity caused by full inhibition of PERK kinase activity. However, other stress pathways besides the UPR converge on phosphorylated eIF2alpha in the integrated stress response (ISR), which is critical to normal cellular function. We explored whether partial inhibition of PERK signaling may be a better therapeutic option. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha requires its binding to the insert loop within PERK's kinase domain, which is, itself, phosphorylated at multiple sites. We found that, as expected, Akt mediates the phosphorylation of Thr(799) in PERK. This phosphorylation event reduced eIF2alpha binding to PERK and selectively attenuated downstream signaling independently of PERK activity and the broader ISR. Induction of Thr(799) phosphorylation with a small-molecule activator of Akt similarly reduced PERK signaling and increased both neuronal and animal survival without measurable pancreatic toxicity in a mouse model of prion disease. Thus, promoting PERK phosphorylation at Thr(799) to partially down-regulate PERK-eIF2alpha signaling while avoiding widespread ISR inhibition may be a safe therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disease.	Targeting the kinase insert loop of PERK selectively modulates PERK signaling without systemic toxicity in mice.	Science signaling
32817372	Disruption of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway results in the transactivation of NRF2 target genes, consequently inducing cell proliferation and other phenotypic changes in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that GULP1 was a KEAP1-binding protein that maintained actin cytoskeleton architecture and helped KEAP1 to sequester NRF2 in the cytoplasm. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), silencing of GULP1 facilitated the nuclear accumulation of NRF2, led to constitutive activation of NRF2 signaling, and conferred resistance to the platinum drug cisplatin. Knockdown of GULP1 in UCB cells promoted tumor cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. In primary UCB, GULP1 silencing was more prevalent in muscle-invasive UCB compared to nonmuscle-invasive UCB. GULP1 knockdown cells showed resistance to cisplatin treatment. In parallel with decreased GULP1 expression, we observed increased expression of NRF2, HMOX1, and other candidate antioxidant genes in cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, low or no expression of GULP1 was observed in most cisplatin nonresponder cases. Silencing of GULP1 was associated with GULP1 promoter hypermethylation in cell lines and primary tumors, and a high frequency of GULP1 promoter methylation was observed in multiple sets of primary clinical UCB samples. Together, our findings demonstrate that GULP1 is a KEAP1-binding protein that regulates KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in UCB and that promoter hypermethylation of GULP1 is a potential mechanism of GULP1 silencing.	GULP1 regulates the NRF2-KEAP1 signaling axis in urothelial carcinoma.	Science signaling
32873725	The cardiac membrane protein phospholamban (PLN) is targeted by protein kinase A (PKA) at Ser(16) and by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at Thr(17) beta-Adrenergic stimulation and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser(16) acutely stimulate the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) by relieving its inhibition by PLN. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation may lead to longer-lasting SERCA stimulation and may sustain maladaptive Ca(2+) handling. Here, we demonstrated that phosphorylation at either Ser(16) or Thr(17) converted PLN into a target for the phosphoadaptor protein 14-3-3 with different affinities. 14-3-3 proteins were localized within nanometers of PLN and endogenous 14-3-3 coimmunoprecipitated with pentameric PLN from cardiac membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted different molecular contacts for peptides phosphorylated at Ser(16) or Thr(17) with the binding groove of 14-3-3, resulting in varied binding affinities. 14-3-3 binding protected either PLN phosphosite from dephosphorylation. beta-Adrenergic stimulation of isolated adult cardiomyocytes resulted in the membrane recruitment of endogenous 14-3-3. The exogenous addition of 14-3-3 to beta-adrenergic-stimulated cardiomyocytes led to prolonged SERCA activation, presumably because 14-3-3 protected PLN pentamers from dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser(16) was disrupted by the cardiomyopathy-associated Arg(14) mutation, implying that phosphorylation of Thr(17) by CaMKII may become crucial for 14-3-3 recruitment to Arg(14) PLN. Consistent with PLN acting as a dynamic hub in the control of Ca(2+) handling, our results identify 14-3-3 binding to PLN as a contractility-augmenting mechanism.	14-3-3 binding creates a memory of kinase action by stabilizing the modified state of phospholamban.

32900880	The reciprocal regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) by protein kinases is essential to cell cycle progression and control, particularly during mitosis for which the role of kinases has been extensively studied. PPPs perform much of the serine/threonine dephosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and achieve substrate selectivity and specificity through the interaction of distinct regulatory subunits with conserved catalytic subunits in holoenzyme complexes. Using a mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approach to enrich, identify, and quantify endogenous PPP holoenzyme complexes combined with kinase profiling, we investigated the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of PPP holoenzymes in mitotic cells. We found that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylated a threonine residue on the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, which disrupted its holoenzyme formation with the regulatory subunit B55. The consequent decrease in the dephosphorylation of PP2A-B55 substrates promoted mitotic entry. This direct phosphorylation by CDK1 was in addition to a previously reported indirect mechanism, thus adding a layer to the interaction between CDK1 and PP2A in regulating mitotic entry.	Quantitative kinase and phosphatase profiling reveal that CDK1 phosphorylates PP2Ac to promote mitotic entry.	Science signaling
33082288	The high abundance of drug efflux pumps in cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributes to chemotherapy resistance. The transcriptional regulator SMAR1 suppresses CSC expansion in colorectal cancer, and increased abundance of SMAR1 is associated with better prognosis. Here, we found in breast tumors that the expression of SMAR1 was decreased in CSCs through the cooperative interaction of the pluripotency factors Oct4 and Sox2 with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Overexpressing SMAR1 sensitized CSCs to chemotherapy through SMAR1-dependent recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoter of the gene encoding the drug efflux pump ABCG2. Treating cultured CSCs or 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin restored SMAR1 expression and ABCG2 repression and enhanced tumor sensitivity to doxorubicin. Our findings reveal transcriptional mechanisms regulating SMAR1 that also regulate cancer stemness and chemoresistance and suggest that, by restoring SMAR1 expression, aspirin might enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with stem-like tumors.	SMAR1 repression by pluripotency factors and consequent chemoresistance in breast cancer stem-like cells is reversed by aspirin.	Science signaling
33172955	The protein Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is frequently overexpressed at the transcript level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes metastatic progression through the induction of beta-catenin, a Wnt signaling effector. We investigated how DKK1 expression is induced in HCC and found that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promoted parallel MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathway signaling that converged to epigenetically stimulate DKK1 transcription. In HCC cell lines stimulated with EGF, EGFR-activated ERK phosphorylated the kinase PKM2 at Ser(37), which promoted its nuclear translocation. Also in these cells, EGFR-activated Akt phosphorylated the acetyltransferase p300 at Ser(1834) Subsequently, PKM2 and p300 mediated the phosphorylation and acetylation, respectively, of histone H3 at the DKK1 promoter, which synergistically enhanced DKK1 transcription. The mechanism was supported with mutational analyses in cells and in a chemically induced HCC model in rats. The findings suggest that dual inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways might suppress the expression of DKK1 and, consequently, tumor metastasis in patients with HCC.	EGF promotes DKK1 transcription in hepatocellular carcinoma by enhancing the phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3.	Science signaling
33262293	LGR4 and LGR5 encode two homologous receptors with critical, yet distinct, roles in organ development and adult stem cell survival. Both receptors are coexpressed in intestinal crypt stem cells, bind to R-spondins (RSPOs) with high affinity, and potentiate Wnt-beta-catenin signaling, presumably by the same mechanism: forming RSPO-bridged complexes with the E3 ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3 to inhibit ubiquitylation of Wnt receptors. However, direct evidence for RSPO-bound, full-length LGR5 interacting with these E3 ligases in whole cells has not been reported, and only LGR4 is essential for the self-renewal of intestinal stem cells. Here, we examined the mechanisms of action of LGR4 and LGR5 in parallel using coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation, competition binding, and time-resolved FRET assays in whole cells. Full-length LGR4 formed a tight complex with ZNRF3 and RNF43 even without RSPO, whereas LGR5 did not interact with either E3 ligase with or without RSPO. Domain-swapping experiments with LGR4 and LGR5 revealed that the seven-transmembrane domain of LGR4 conferred interaction with the E3 ligases. Native LGR4 and LGR5 existed as dimers on the cell surface, and LGR5 interacted with both FZD and LRP6 of the Wnt signalosome to enhance LRP6 phosphorylation and potentiate Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. These findings provide a molecular basis for the weaker activity of LGR5 in the potentiation of Wnt signaling that may underlie the distinct roles of LGR4 and LGR5 in organ development, as well as the self-renewal and fitness of adult stem cells.	Unlike LGR4, LGR5 potentiates Wnt-beta-catenin signaling without sequestering E3 ligases.	Science signaling
33323411	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) proteins regulate multiple cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix formation. The dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling causes diseases such as cancer and fibrosis, and therefore, understanding the biochemical basis of TGF-beta signal transduction is important for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases. SMAD proteins are transcription factors that mediate TGF-beta signaling-dependent gene expression. The transcriptional coactivator CBP directly interacts with the MH2 domains of SMAD2 to activate SMAD complex-dependent gene expression. Here, we report the structural basis for CBP recognition by SMAD2. The crystal structures of the SMAD2 MH2 domain in complex with the SMAD2-binding region of CBP showed that CBP forms an amphiphilic helix on the hydrophobic surface of SMAD2. The expression of a mutated CBP peptide that showed increased SMAD2 binding repressed SMAD2-dependent gene expression in response to TGF-beta signaling in cultured cells. Disrupting the interaction between SMAD2 and CBP may therefore be a promising strategy for suppressing SMAD-dependent gene expression.

33443209	Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons characterizes Parkinson's disease (PD). This neuronal loss occurs through diverse mechanisms, including a form of programmed cell death dependent on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) called parthanatos. Deficient activity of the kinase Akt1 and aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein are also implicated in disease pathogenesis. Here, we found that Akt1 suppressed parthanatos in dopaminergic neurons through a transcriptional mechanism. Overexpressing constitutively active Akt1 in SH-SY5Y cells or culturing cells with chlorogenic acid (a polyphenol found in coffee that activates Akt1) stimulated the CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146. RNF146 inhibited PARP1 not through its E3 ligase function but rather by binding to and sequestering PAR, which enhanced the survival of cultured cells exposed to the dopaminergic neuronal toxin 6-OHDA or alpha-synuclein aggregation. In mice, intraperitoneal administration of chlorogenic acid activated the Akt1-CREB-RNF146 pathway in the brain and provided neuroprotection against both 6-OHDA and combinatorial alpha-synucleinopathy in an RNF146-dependent manner. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Akt1-CREB pathway was observed in postmortem brain samples from patients with PD. The findings suggest that therapeutic restoration of RNF146 expression, such as by activating the Akt1-CREB pathway, might halt neurodegeneration in PD.	Activation of the Akt1-CREB pathway promotes RNF146 expression to inhibit PARP1-mediated neuronal death.	Science signaling
33653921	Renal fibrosis is a common end point for kidney injury and many chronic kidney diseases. Fibrogenesis depends on the sustained activation of myofibroblasts, which deposit the extracellular matrix that causes progressive scarring and organ failure. Here, we showed that the transcription factor SOX9 was associated with kidney fibrosis in humans and required for experimentally induced kidney fibrosis in mice. From genome-wide analysis, we identified Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as acting downstream of SOX9 in kidney fibrosis. NAV3 increased in abundance and colocalized with SOX9 after renal injury in mice, and both SOX9 and NAV3 were present in diseased human kidneys. In an in vitro model of renal pericyte transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, we demonstrated that NAV3 was required for multiple aspects of fibrogenesis, including actin polymerization linked to cell migration and sustained activation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP1. In summary, our work identifies a SOX9-NAV3-YAP1 axis involved in the progression of kidney fibrosis and points to NAV3 as a potential target for pharmacological intervention.	SOX9 is required for kidney fibrosis and activates NAV3 to drive renal myofibroblast function.	Science signaling

33758062	NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) release through type 1 ryanodine receptors (RYR1) is a major mechanism underlying the earliest signals in T cell activation, which are the formation of Ca(2+) microdomains. In our characterization of the molecular machinery underlying NAADP action, we identified an NAADP-binding protein, called hematological and neurological expressed 1-like protein (HN1L) [also known as Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2)]. Gene deletion of Hn1l/Jpt2 in human Jurkat and primary rat T cells resulted in decreased numbers of initial Ca(2+) microdomains and delayed the onset and decreased the amplitude of global Ca(2+) signaling. Photoaffinity labeling demonstrated direct binding of NAADP to recombinant HN1L/JPT2. T cell receptor/CD3-dependent coprecipitation of HN1L/JPT2 with RYRs and colocalization of these proteins suggest that HN1L/JPT2 connects NAADP formation with the activation of RYR channels within the first seconds of T cell activation. Thus, HN1L/JPT2 enables NAADP to activate Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum through RYR.	HN1L/JPT2: A signaling protein that connects NAADP generation to Ca(2+) microdomain formation.

33785611	Innate immune responses to Gram-negative bacteria depend on the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by a receptor complex that includes CD14 and TLR4. In dendritic cells (DCs), CD14 enhances the activation not only of TLR4 but also that of the NFAT family of transcription factors, which suppresses cell survival and promotes the production of inflammatory mediators. NFAT activation requires Ca(2+) mobilization. In DCs, Ca(2+) mobilization in response to LPS depends on phospholipase C gamma2 (PLCgamma2), which produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Here, we showed that the IP3 receptor 3 (IP3R3) and ITPKB, a kinase that converts IP3 to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), were both necessary for Ca(2+) mobilization and NFAT activation in mouse and human DCs. A pool of IP3R3 was located on the plasma membrane of DCs, where it colocalized with CD14 and ITPKB. Upon LPS binding to CD14, ITPKB was required for Ca(2+) mobilization through plasma membrane-localized IP3R3 and for NFAT nuclear translocation. Pharmacological inhibition of ITPKB in mice reduced both LPS-induced tissue swelling and the severity of inflammatory arthritis to a similar extent as that induced by the inhibition of NFAT using nanoparticles that delivered an NFAT-inhibiting peptide specifically to phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that ITPKB may represent a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapies that aim to inhibit specific DC functions.

Here, we demonstrated that the myeloid lineage-restricted MPO-HOCl system had antitumor effects in early melanoma growth in aged mice. Orthotopic melanomas grew more slowly in immunocompetent MPO(+/+) host mice compared to age-matched syngeneic MPO(-/-) mice. Real-time intravital tumor imaging in vivo and in cell cocultures revealed a cell-cell proximity-dependent association between MDC-derived MPO enzyme activity and blockade of ligand-induced IkappaBalpha degradation in tumor cells. HOCl directly trans-inhibited IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity in tumor cells, thereby decreasing nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activation and inducing changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication. By contrast, HOCl induced transcriptional changes in CD8(+) T cells related to ion transport and the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways that are associated with T cell activation. MPO increased the circulating concentrations of the myeloid cell-attracting cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL5, enhanced local infiltration by CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, and decreased tumor growth. Overall, these data reveal a role for MDC-derived HOCl as a small-molecule paracrine signaling factor that trans-inhibits IKK in melanoma tumor cells, mediating antitumor responses during early tumor progression.	Myeloid cell-derived HOCl is a paracrine effector that trans-inhibits IKK/NF-kappaB in melanoma cells and limits early tumor progression.	Science signaling
33850054	The complex mTORC2 is accepted to be the kinase that controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif, a key regulatory switch for AGC kinases, although whether mTOR directly phosphorylates this motif remains controversial. Here, we identified an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation site that we termed the TOR interaction motif (TIM; F-x3-F-pT), which controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of PKC and Akt and the activity of these kinases. The TIM is invariant in mTORC2-dependent AGC kinases, is evolutionarily conserved, and coevolved with mTORC2 components. Mutation of this motif in Akt1 and PKCbetaII abolished cellular kinase activity by impairing activation loop and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. mTORC2 directly phosphorylated the PKC TIM in vitro, and this phosphorylation event was detected in mouse brain. Overexpression of PDK1 in mTORC2-deficient cells rescued hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC and Akt by a mechanism dependent on their intrinsic catalytic activity, revealing that mTORC2 facilitates the PDK1 phosphorylation step, which, in turn, enables autophosphorylation. Structural analysis revealed that PKC homodimerization is driven by a TIM-containing helix, and biophysical proximity assays showed that newly synthesized, unphosphorylated PKC dimerizes in cells. Furthermore, disruption of the dimer interface by stapled peptides promoted hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which mTORC2 relieves nascent PKC dimerization through TIM phosphorylation, recruiting PDK1 to phosphorylate the activation loop and triggering intramolecular hydrophobic motif autophosphorylation. Identification of TIM phosphorylation and its role in the regulation of PKC provides the basis for AGC kinase regulation by mTORC2.	mTORC2 controls the activity of PKC and Akt by phosphorylating a conserved TOR interaction motif.

33850055	The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway is pivotal for innate immunity against invading viruses, and dysregulation of this molecular cascade has been linked to various diseases. Here, we identified dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2) as a potent regulator of the RLR-mediated antiviral response in human and mouse. Overexpression of DDAH2 attenuated RLR signaling, whereas loss of DDAH2 function enhanced RLR signaling and suppressed viral replication ex vivo and in mice. Upon viral infection, DDAH2 relocated to mitochondria, where it induced the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promoted mitochondrial fission and blocked the activation of innate immune responses mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a kinase downstream of MAVS, inhibited DDAH2 by phosphorylating DDAH2 at multiple sites. Our study thus identifies a reciprocal inhibitory loop between the DDAH2-NO cascade and the RLR signaling pathway that fine-tunes the antiviral immune response.	DDAH2 suppresses RLR-MAVS-mediated innate antiviral immunity by stimulating nitric oxide-activated, Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission.	Science signaling
33879602	Chloride intracellular channels 1 (CLIC1) and 4 (CLIC4) are expressed in endothelial cells and regulate angiogenic behaviors in vitro, and the expression of Clic4 is important for vascular development and function in mice. Here, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 in endothelial cells regulate critical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways associated with vascular development and disease. In cultured endothelial cells, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 transiently translocated to the plasma membrane in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Both CLIC1 and CLIC4 were essential for mediating S1P-induced activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 downstream of S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). In contrast, only CLIC1 was essential for S1P-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA downstream of S1PR2 and S1PR3. Neither were required for other S1P-S1PR signaling outputs. Rescue experiments revealed that CLIC1 and CLIC4 were not functionally interchangeable, suggesting distinct and specific functions for CLICs in transducing GPCR signaling. These CLIC-mediated mechanisms were critical for S1P-induced stimulation of the barrier function in endothelial cell monolayers. Our results define CLICs as previously unknown players in the pathways linking GPCRs to small GTPases and vascular endothelial function.	CLIC1 and CLIC4 mediate endothelial S1P receptor signaling to facilitate Rac1 and RhoA activity and function.	Science signaling
34035143	During cellular stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident dual kinase and RNase Ire1 splices an intron from HAC1 mRNA in the cytosol, thereby releasing its translational block. Hac1 protein then activates an adaptive cellular stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains ER homeostasis. The polarity-inducing protein kinases Kin1 and Kin2 contribute to HAC1 mRNA processing. Here, we showed that an RNA-protein complex that included the endocytic proteins Pal1 and Pal2 mediated HAC1 mRNA splicing downstream of Kin1 and Kin2. We found that Pal1 and Pal2 bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of HAC1 mRNA, and a yeast strain lacking both Pal1 and Pal2 was deficient in HAC1 mRNA processing. We also showed that Kin1 and Kin2 directly phosphorylated Pal2, and that a nonphosphorylatable Pal2 mutant could not rescue the UPR defect in a pal1Delta pal2Delta strain. Thus, our work uncovers a Kin1/2-Pal2 signaling pathway that coordinates HAC1 mRNA processing and ER homeostasis.	Phosphorylation of Pal2 by the protein kinases Kin1 and Kin2 modulates HAC1 mRNA splicing in the unfolded protein response in yeast.	Science signaling
34074704	The activation of Ras signaling is a major early event of oncogenesis in many contexts, yet paradoxically, Ras signaling induces cellular senescence, which prevents tumorigenesis. Thus, Ras-activated cells must overcome senescence to develop into cancer. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, we found that the ETS family transcriptional activator Pointed (Pnt) was necessary and sufficient to trigger cellular senescence upon Ras activation and blocked Ras-induced tumor growth in eye-antennal discs. Through analyses of mosaic discs using various genetic tools, we identified a mechanism of tumor progression in which loss of cell polarity, a common driver of epithelial oncogenesis, abrogated Ras-induced cellular senescence through microRNA-mediated inhibition of Pnt. Mechanistically, polarity defects in Ras-activated cells caused activation of the Hippo effector Yorkie (Yki), which induced the expression of the microRNA bantam bantam-mediated repression of the E3 ligase-associated protein Tribbles (Trbl) relieved Ras- and Akt-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor FoxO. The restoration of FoxO activity in Ras-activated cells induced the expression of the microRNAs miR-9c and miR-79, which led to reduced pnt expression, thereby abrogating cellular senescence and promoting tumor progression. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how Ras-activated tumors progress toward malignancy by overcoming cellular senescence.	Yorkie drives Ras-induced tumor progression by microRNA-mediated inhibition of cellular senescence.	Science signaling
34131021	Expression of the transmembrane protein Tim-3 is increased on dysregulated T cells undergoing chronic activation, including during chronic infection and in solid tumors. Thus, Tim-3 is generally thought of as an inhibitory protein. We and others previously reported that under some circumstances, Tim-3 exerts paradoxical costimulatory activity in T cells (and other cells), including enhancement of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein. Here, we examined the upstream signaling pathways that control Tim-3-mediated increases in phosphorylated S6 in T cells. We also defined the localization of Tim-3 relative to the T cell immune synapse and its effects on downstream signaling. Recruitment of Tim-3 to the immune synapse was mediated exclusively by the transmembrane domain, replacement of which impaired the ability of Tim-3 to costimulate T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent S6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, enforced localization of the Tim-3 cytoplasmic domain to the immune synapse in a chimeric antigen receptor still enabled T cell activation. Together, our findings are consistent with a model whereby Tim-3 enhances TCR-proximal signaling under acute conditions.	The costimulatory activity of Tim-3 requires Akt and MAPK signaling and its recruitment to the immune synapse.	Science signaling
34131022	Many viral proteases mediate the evasion of antiviral innate immunity by cleaving adapter proteins in the interferon (IFN) induction pathway. Host proteases are also involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report that the transmembrane protease hepsin (also known as TMPRSS1), which is predominantly present in hepatocytes, inhibited the induction of type I IFN during viral infections. Knocking out hepsin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased the viral infection-induced expression of Ifnb1, an Ifnb1 promoter reporter, and an IFN-sensitive response element promoter reporter. Ectopic expression of hepsin in cultured human hepatocytes and HEK293T cells suppressed the induction of IFNbeta during viral infections by reducing the abundance of STING. These effects depended on the protease activity of hepsin. We identified a putative hepsin target site in STING and showed that mutating this site protected STING from hepsin-mediated cleavage. In addition to hepatocytes, several hepsin-producing prostate cancer cell lines showed reduced STING-mediated type I IFN induction and responses. These results reveal a role for hepsin in suppressing STING-mediated type I IFN induction, which may contribute to the vulnerability of hepatocytes to chronic viral infections.	The transmembrane serine protease hepsin suppresses type I interferon induction by cleaving STING.	Science signaling
34158398	Unlike early transcriptional responses to mitogens, later events are less well-characterized. Here, we identified delayed down-regulated genes (DDGs) in mammary cells after prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The expression of these DDGs was low in mammary tumors and correlated with prognosis. The proteins encoded by several DDGs directly bind to and inactivate oncoproteins and might therefore act as tumor suppressors. The transcription factor teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 (TSHZ2) is encoded by a DDG, and we found that overexpression of TSHZ2 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and accelerated mammary gland development in mice. Although the gene TSHZ2 localizes to a locus (20q13.2) that is frequently amplified in breast cancer, we found that hypermethylation of its promoter correlated with down-regulation of TSHZ2 expression in patients. Yeast two-hybrid screens and protein-fragment complementation assays in mammalian cells indicated that TSHZ2 nucleated a multiprotein complex containing PRC1/Ase1, cyclin B1, and additional proteins that regulate cytokinesis. TSHZ2 increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of PRC1, a key driver of mitosis, mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, similar to the tumor suppressive transcription factor p53, TSHZ2 inhibited transcription from the PRC1 promoter. By recognizing DDGs as a distinct group in the transcriptional response to EGF, our findings uncover a group of tumor suppressors and reveal a role for TSHZ2 in cell cycle regulation.	TSHZ2 is an EGF-regulated tumor suppressor that binds to the cytokinesis regulator PRC1 and inhibits metastasis.	Science signaling
34187905	The maintenance of telomere length supports repetitive cell division and therefore plays a central role in cancer development and progression. Telomeres are extended by either the enzyme telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we found that the telomere-associated protein SLX4IP dictates telomere proteome composition by recruiting and activating the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 to the SLX4 complex. PIAS1 SUMOylated the telomere-binding protein RAP1, which disrupted its interaction with the telomere-binding protein TRF2 and facilitated its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In the cytosol, RAP1 bound to IkappaB kinase (IKK), resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its induction of Jagged-1 expression, which promoted Notch signaling and the institution of ALT. This axis could be targeted therapeutically in ALT-driven cancers and in tumor cells that develop resistance to antitelomerase therapies. Our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying SLX4IP-dependent telomere plasticity and demonstrate the role of telomere proteins in directly coordinating intracellular signaling and telomere maintenance dynamics.	SLX4IP promotes RAP1 SUMOylation by PIAS1 to coordinate telomere maintenance through NF-kappaB and Notch signaling.	Science signaling
34285131	Murine gammadelta(17) cells, which are T cells that bear the gammadelta T cell receptor (TCRgammadelta) and secrete interleukin-17A (IL-17A), are generated in the thymus and are critical for various immune responses. Although strong TCRgammadelta signals are required for the development of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting gammadelta cells (gammadelta(IFN) cells), the generation of gammadelta(17) cells requires weaker TCRgammadelta signaling. Here, we demonstrated that constrained activation of the kinase Syk downstream of TCRgammadelta was required for the thymic development of gammadelta(17) cells. Increasing or decreasing Syk activity by stimulating TCRgammadelta or inhibiting Syk, respectively, substantially reduced gammadelta(17) cell numbers. This delimited Syk activity optimally engaged the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which maintained the expression of master regulators of the IL-17 program, RORgammat and c-Maf. Inhibition of PI3K not only abrogated gammadelta(17) cell development but also augmented the development of a distinct, previously undescribed subset of gammadelta T cells. These CD8(+)Ly6a(+) gammadelta T cells had a type-I IFN gene expression signature and expanded in response to stimulation with IFN-beta. Collectively, these studies elucidate how weaker TCRgammadelta signaling engages distinct signaling pathways to specify the gammadelta(17) cell fate and identifies a role for type-I IFNs in gammadelta T cell development.	Constrained TCRgammadelta-associated Syk activity engages PI3K to facilitate thymic development of IL-17A-secreting gammadelta T cells.	Science signaling
34404752	The pleiotropic chemokine CXCL12 is involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, and tumor metastasis. It is known to engage the classical receptor CXCR4 and the atypical receptor ACKR3. Differential receptor engagement can transduce distinct cellular signals and effects as well as alter the amount of free, extracellular chemokine. CXCR4 binds both monomeric and the more commonly found dimeric forms of CXCL12, whereas ACKR3 binds monomeric forms. Here, we found that CXCL12 also bound to the atypical receptor ACKR1 (previously known as Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines or DARC). In vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that dimeric CXCL12 bound to the extracellular N terminus of ACKR1 with low nanomolar affinity, whereas the binding affinity of monomeric CXCL12 was orders of magnitude lower. In transfected MDCK cells and primary human Duffy-positive erythrocytes, a dimeric, but not a monomeric, construct of CXCL12 efficiently bound to and internalized with ACKR1. This interaction between CXCL12 and ACKR1 provides another layer of regulation of the multiple biological functions of CXCL12. The findings also raise the possibility that ACKR1 can bind other dimeric chemokines, thus potentially further expanding the role of ACKR1 in chemokine retention and presentation.

34637328	CD200 receptor 1 (CD200R) is an inhibitory immunoreceptor that suppresses Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production through the adaptor protein Dok2 and the GTPase activating protein (GAP) p120-RasGAP, which can be cleaved during mild cellular stress. We found that in the presence of cleaved p120-RasGAP, CD200R lost its capacity to inhibit phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein (rpS6), suggesting the reduced activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) resulted in increased amounts of cleaved p120-RasGAP. Upon pretreatment of cells with increasing concentrations of IFN-alpha, CD200R switched from inhibiting to potentiating the TLR7- and TLR8-induced expression of the gene encoding IFN-gamma, a cytokine that is important for innate and adaptive immunity and is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. PBMC from patients with SLE, a prototypic type I IFN disease, had an increased abundance of cleaved p120-RasGAP compared to that in cells from healthy controls. In a subset of SLE patients, CD200R stopped functioning as an inhibitory receptor or potentiated TLR-induced IFNG mRNA expression. Thus, our data suggest that type I IFN rewires CD200R signaling to be proinflammatory, which could contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation in patients with SLE.	Signaling by the inhibitory receptor CD200R is rewired by type I interferon.	Science signaling

32270908	Centrosome amplification is a hallmark of cancer, and centrosome clustering is essential for cancer cell survival. The mitotic kinesin HSET is an essential contributor to this process. Recent studies have highlighted novel functions for intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins in regulating motors and mitotic processes. Here, using siRNA knock-down of various IFT proteins or AID-inducible degradation of endogenous IFT88 in combination with small-molecule inhibition of HSET, we show that IFT proteins together with HSET are required for efficient centrosome clustering. We identify a direct interaction between the kinesin HSET and IFT proteins, and we define how IFT proteins contribute to clustering dynamics during mitosis using high-resolution live imaging of centrosomes. Finally, we demonstrate the requirement of IFT88 for efficient centrosome clustering in a variety of cancer cell lines naturally harboring supernumerary centrosomes and its importance for cancer cell proliferation. Overall, our data unravel a novel role for the IFT machinery in centrosome clustering during mitosis in cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes.

32307883	The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is the key E3 ubiquitin ligase which directs mitotic progression and exit by catalysing the sequential ubiquitination of specific substrates. The activity of the APC/C in mitosis is restrained by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which coordinates chromosome segregation with the assembly of the mitotic spindle. The SAC effector is the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which binds and inhibits the APC/C. It is incompletely understood how the APC/C switches substrate specificity in a cell cycle-specific manner. For instance, it is unclear how in prometaphase, when APC/C activity towards cyclin B and securin is repressed by the MCC, the kinase Nek2A is ubiquitinated. Here, we combine biochemical and structural analysis with functional studies in cells to show that Nek2A is a conformational-specific binder of the APC/C-MCC complex (APC/C(MCC) ) and that, in contrast to cyclin A, Nek2A can be ubiquitinated efficiently by the APC/C in conjunction with both the E2 enzymes UbcH10 and UbcH5. We propose that these special features of Nek2A allow its prometaphase-specific ubiquitination.	A unique binding mode of Nek2A to the APC/C allows its ubiquitination during prometaphase.

32351028	Neuronal activity is responsible for the high energy consumption in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms draining ATP upon the arrival of a stimulus are yet to be explored systematically at the post-synapse. Here, we provide evidence that a significant fraction of ATP is consumed upon glutamate stimulation to energize mGluR-induced protein synthesis. We find that both mGluR and NMDAR alter protein synthesis and ATP consumption with distinct kinetics at the synaptic-dendritic compartments. While mGluR activation leads to a rapid and sustained reduction in neuronal ATP levels, NMDAR activation has no immediate impact on the same. ATP consumption correlates inversely with the kinetics of protein synthesis for both receptors. We observe a persistent elevation in protein synthesis within 5 minutes of mGluR activation and a robust inhibition of the same within 2 minutes of NMDAR activation, assessed by the phosphorylation status of eEF2 and metabolic labeling. However, a delayed protein synthesis-dependent ATP expenditure ensues after 15 minutes of NMDAR stimulation. We identify a central role for AMPK in the correlation between protein synthesis and ATP consumption. AMPK is dephosphorylated and inhibited upon mGluR activation, while it is phosphorylated upon NMDAR activation. Perturbing AMPK activity disrupts receptor-specific modulations of eEF2 phosphorylation and protein synthesis. Our observations, therefore, demonstrate that the regulation of the AMPK-eEF2 signaling axis by glutamate receptors alters neuronal protein synthesis and bioenergetics.

32270922	Demyelination is a common pathological feature of a large number of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease (HD). Laquinimod (LAQ) has been found to have therapeutic effects on multiple sclerosis and HD. However, the mechanism underlying LAQ's therapeutic effects remains unknown. Using HD mice that selectively express mutant huntingtin in oligodendrocytes and show demyelination, we found that LAQ reduces the Ser259 phosphorylation on myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), an oligodendrocyte-specific transcription factor promoting the expression of myelin-associated genes. The reduced MYRF phosphorylation inhibits MYRF's binding to mutant huntingtin and increases the expression of myelin-associated genes. We also found that PRKG2, a cGMP-activated protein kinase subunit II, promotes the Ser259-MYRF phosphorylation and that knocking down PRKG2 increased myelin-associated protein's expression in HD mice. Our findings suggest that PRKG2-regulated phosphorylation of MYRF is involved in demyelination and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for reducing demyelination.	Phosphorylation of myelin regulatory factor by PRKG2 mediates demyelination in Huntington's disease.	EMBO reports
32337819	Autophagy is an essential cellular quality control process that has emerged as a critical one for vascular homeostasis. Here, we show that trichoplein (TCHP) links autophagy with endothelial cell (EC) function. TCHP localizes to centriolar satellites, where it binds and stabilizes PCM1. Loss of TCHP leads to delocalization and proteasome-dependent degradation of PCM1, further resulting in degradation of PCM1's binding partner GABARAP. Autophagic flux under basal conditions is impaired in THCP-depleted ECs, and SQSTM1/p62 (p62) accumulates. We further show that TCHP promotes autophagosome maturation and efficient clearance of p62 within lysosomes, without affecting their degradative capacity. Reduced TCHP and high p62 levels are detected in primary ECs from patients with coronary artery disease. This phenotype correlates with impaired EC function and can be ameliorated by NF-kappaB inhibition. Moreover, Tchp knock-out mice accumulate of p62 in the heart and cardiac vessels correlating with reduced cardiac vascularization. Taken together, our data reveal that TCHP regulates endothelial cell function via an autophagy-mediated mechanism.

32510829	"The Fanconi anaemia (FA) pathway is a dedicated pathway for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and is additionally activated in response to other forms of replication stress. A key step in the FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of each of the two subunits (FANCI and FANCD2) of the ID2 complex on specific lysine residues. However, the molecular function of these modifications has been unknown for nearly two decades. Here, we find that ubiquitination of FANCD2 acts to increase ID2's affinity for double-stranded DNA via promoting a large-scale conformational change in the complex. The resulting complex encircles DNA, by forming a secondary ""Arm"" ID2 interface. Ubiquitination of FANCI, on the other hand, largely protects the ubiquitin on FANCD2 from USP1-UAF1 deubiquitination, with key hydrophobic residues of FANCI's ubiquitin being important for this protection. In effect, both of these post-translational modifications function to stabilize a conformation in which the ID2 complex encircles DNA."

32352641	Inflammasomes are intracellular complexes that form in the cytosol of inflammatory cells. NLRP3 is one of the sensor proteins in the complex that can recognize a wide variety of stimuli ranging from microbial components to environmental particulates. Here, we report that in mouse airway epithelial cells (AECs), inflammasome activation is inhibited by EphA2, a member of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor family, via tyrosine phosphorylation of NLRP3 in a model of reovirus infection. We find that EphA2 depletion markedly enhances interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) production in response to the virus. EphA2(-/-) mice show stronger inflammatory infiltration and enhanced inflammasome activation upon viral infection, and aggravated asthma symptoms upon ovalbumin (ova) induction. Mechanistically, EphA2 binds to NLRP3 and induces its phosphorylation at Tyr132, thereby interfering with ASC speck formation and blocking the activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome. These data demonstrate that reovirus employs EphA2 to suppress inflammasome activation in AECs and that EphA2 deficiency causes a pathological exacerbation of asthma in an ova-induced asthma model.	EphA2 phosphorylates NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasomes in airway epithelial cells.	EMBO reports
32410369	Negative regulation of immunoreceptor signaling is required for preventing hyperimmune activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. The roles of p38IP in immunoreceptor signaling remain unclear. Here, we show that p38IP suppresses T-cell receptor (TCR)/LPS-activated NF-kappaB and p38 by targeting TAK1 kinase and that p38IP protein levels are downregulated in human PBMCs from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, inversely correlating with the enhanced activity of NF-kappaB and p38. Mechanistically, p38IP interacts with TAK1 to disassemble the TAK1-TAB (TAK1-binding protein) complex. p38IP overexpression decreases TCR-induced binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains to TAK1 but increases that to TAB2, and p38IP knockdown shows the opposite effects, indicating unanchored K63-linked polyUb chain transfer from TAB2 to TAK1. p38IP dynamically interacts with TAK1 upon stimulation, because of the polyUb chain transfer and the higher binding affinity of TAK1 and p38IP for polyUb-bound TAB2 and TAK1, respectively. Moreover, p38IP scaffolds the deubiquitinase USP4 to deubiquitinate TAK1 once TAK1 is activated. These findings reveal a novel role and the mechanisms of p38IP in controlling TCR/LPS signaling and suggest that p38IP might participate in RA pathogenesis.

32484313	Nuclear accessibility of transcription factors controls gene expression, co-regulated by Ran-dependent nuclear localization and a competitive regulatory network. Here, we reveal that nuclear import factor-facilitated transcriptional repression attenuates ribosome biogenesis under chronic salt stress. Kap114p, one of the karyopherin-betas (Kap-betas) that mediates nuclear import of yeast TATA-binding protein (yTBP), exhibits a yTBP-binding affinity four orders of magnitude greater than its counterparts and suppresses binding of yTBP with DNA. Our crystal structure of Kap114p reveals an extensively negatively charged concave surface, accounting for high-affinity basic-protein binding. KAP114 knockout in yeast leads to a high-salt growth defect, with transcriptomic analyses revealing that Kap114p modulates expression of genes associated with ribosomal biogenesis by suppressing yTBP binding to target promoters, a trans-repression mechanism we attribute to reduced nuclear Ran levels under salinity stress. Our findings reveal that Ran integrates the nuclear transport pathway and transcription regulatory network, allowing yeast to respond to environmental stresses.

32383557	From fly to mammals, the Smaug/Samd4 family of prion-like RNA-binding proteins control gene expression by destabilizing and/or repressing the translation of numerous target transcripts. However, the regulation of its activity remains poorly understood. We show that Smaug's protein levels and mRNA repressive activity are downregulated by Hedgehog signaling in tissue culture cells. These effects rely on the interaction of Smaug with the G-protein coupled receptor Smoothened, which promotes the phosphorylation of Smaug by recruiting the kinase Fused. The activation of Fused and its binding to Smaug are sufficient to suppress its ability to form cytosolic bodies and to antagonize its negative effects on endogenous targets. Importantly, we demonstrate in vivo that HH reduces the levels of smaug mRNA and increases the level of several mRNAs downregulated by Smaug. Finally, we show that Smaug acts as a positive regulator of Hedgehog signaling during wing morphogenesis. These data constitute the first evidence for a post-translational regulation of Smaug and reveal that the fate of several mRNAs bound to Smaug is modulated by a major signaling pathway.

32484317	Leaf senescence is a highly complex developmental process that is tightly controlled by multiple layers of regulation. Abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two well-known factors that promote leaf senescence. We show here that the transcription factor CDF4 positively regulates leaf senescence. Constitutive and inducible overexpression of CDF4 accelerates leaf senescence, while knockdown of CDF4 delays it. CDF4 increases endogenous ABA levels by upregulating the transcription of the ABA biosynthesis genes 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2, 3 (NCED2, 3) and suppresses H2 O2 scavenging by repressing expression of the catalase2 (CAT2) gene. NCED2, 3 knockout and CAT2 overexpression partially rescue premature leaf senescence caused by CDF4 overexpression. We also show that CDF4 promotes floral organ abscission by activating the polygalacturonase PGAZAT gene. Based on these results, we propose that the levels of CDF4, ABA, and ROS undergo a gradual increase driven by their interlinking positive feedback loops during the leaf senescence and floral organ abscission processes.	Transcription factor CDF4 promotes leaf senescence and floral organ abscission by regulating abscisic acid and reactive oxygen species pathways in Arabidopsis.	EMBO reports
32558157	At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), lipoprotein-related receptor 4 (LRP4) mediates agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation that leads to clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic region of the skeletal muscle. Additionally, the ectodomain of LRP4 is necessary for differentiation of the presynaptic nerve terminal. However, the molecules regulating LRP4 have not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we show that the CT domain of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) directly binds to the third beta-propeller domain of LRP4. CTGF/CCN2 enhances the binding of LRP4 to MuSK and facilitates the localization of LRP4 on the plasma membrane. CTGF/CCN2 enhances agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation and AChR clustering in cultured myotubes. Ctgf-deficient mouse embryos (Ctgf(-/-) ) have small AChR clusters and abnormal dispersion of synaptic vesicles along the motor axon. Ultrastructurally, the presynaptic nerve terminals have reduced numbers of active zones and mitochondria. Functionally, Ctgf(-/-) embryos exhibit impaired NMJ signal transmission. These results indicate that CTGF/CCN2 interacts with LRP4 to facilitate clustering of AChRs at the motor endplate and the maturation of the nerve terminal.	CTGF/CCN2 facilitates LRP4-mediated formation of the embryonic neuromuscular junction.	EMBO reports
32484300	Impairment of PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy is currently proposed to be the molecular basis of mitochondrial abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD). We here demonstrate that PINK1 directly phosphorylates Drp1 on S616. Drp1(S616) phosphorylation is significantly reduced in cells and mouse tissues deficient for PINK1, but unaffected by parkin inactivation. PINK1-mediated mitochondrial fission is Drp1(S616) phosphorylation dependent. Overexpression of either wild-type Drp1 or of the phosphomimetic mutant Drp1(S616D) , but not a dephosphorylation-mimic mutant Drp1(S616A) , rescues PINK1 deficiency-associated phenotypes in Drosophila. Moreover, Drp1 restores PINK1-dependent mitochondrial fission in ATG5-null cells and ATG7-null Drosophila. Reduced Drp1(S616) phosphorylation is detected in fibroblasts derived from 4 PD patients harboring PINK1 mutations and in 4 out of 7 sporadic PD cases. Taken together, we have identified Drp1 as a substrate of PINK1 and a novel mechanism how PINK1 regulates mitochondrial fission independent of parkin and autophagy. Our results further link impaired PINK1-mediated Drp1(S616) phosphorylation with the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD.	PINK1 phosphorylates Drp1(S616) to regulate mitophagy-independent mitochondrial dynamics.	EMBO reports
32537912	The nuclear lamina is essential for the structural integration of the nuclear envelope. Nuclear envelope rupture and chromatin externalization is a hallmark of the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NET release was described as a cellular lysis process; however, this notion has been questioned recently. Here, we report that during NET formation, nuclear lamin B is not fragmented by destructive proteolysis, but rather disassembled into intact full-length molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of PKCalpha, which serves as the kinase to induce lamin B phosphorylation and disassembly, results in nuclear envelope rupture. Decreasing lamin B phosphorylation by PKCalpha inhibition, genetic deletion, or by mutating the PKCalpha consensus sites on lamin B attenuates extracellular trap formation. In addition, strengthening the nuclear envelope by lamin B overexpression attenuates NET release in vivo and reduces levels of NET-associated inflammatory cytokines in UVB-irradiated skin of lamin B transgenic mice. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding of NET formation by showing that PKCalpha-mediated lamin B phosphorylation drives nuclear envelope rupture for chromatin release in neutrophils.	Nuclear envelope rupture and NET formation is driven by PKCalpha-mediated lamin B disassembly.	EMBO reports
32558204	Maternal mRNA degradation is a critical event of the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) that determines the developmental potential of early embryos. Nuclear Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPNs) are extensively involved in mRNA post-transcriptional regulation, but their function in the MZT has not been investigated. In this study, we find that the maternally expressed PABPN1-like (PABPN1L), rather than its ubiquitously expressed homolog PABPN1, acts as an mRNA-binding adapter of the mammalian MZT licensing factor BTG4, which mediates maternal mRNA clearance. Female Pabpn1l null mice produce morphologically normal oocytes but are infertile owing to early developmental arrest of the resultant embryos at the 1- to 2-cell stage. Deletion of Pabpn1l impairs the deadenylation and degradation of a subset of BTG4-targeted maternal mRNAs during the MZT. In addition to recruiting BTG4 to the mRNA 3'-poly(A) tails, PABPN1L is also required for BTG4 protein accumulation in maturing oocytes by protecting BTG4 from SCF-betaTrCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation. This study highlights a noncanonical cytoplasmic function of nuclear poly(A)-binding protein in mRNA turnover, as well as its physiological importance during the MZT.	PABPN1L mediates cytoplasmic mRNA decay as a placeholder during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.	EMBO reports
32767654	Controlled cell growth and proliferation are essential for tissue homeostasis and development. Wnt and Hippo signaling are well known as positive and negative regulators of cell proliferation, respectively. The regulation of Hippo signaling by the Wnt pathway has been shown, but how and which components of Wnt signaling are involved in the activation of Hippo signaling during nutrient starvation are unknown. Here, we report that a reduction in the level of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) during nutrient starvation induces phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of YAP, inhibiting YAP-dependent transcription. Phosphorylation of YAP via loss of LRP6 is mediated by large tumor suppressor kinases 1/2 (LATS1/2) and Merlin. We found that O-GlcNAcylation of LRP6 was reduced, and the overall amount of LRP6 was decreased via endocytosis-mediated lysosomal degradation during nutrient starvation. Merlin binds to LRP6; when LRP6 is less O-GlcNAcylated, Merlin dissociates from it and becomes capable of interacting with LATS1 to induce phosphorylation of YAP. Our data suggest that LRP6 has unexpected roles as a nutrient sensor and Hippo signaling regulator.	LDL receptor-related protein LRP6 senses nutrient levels and regulates Hippo signaling.

32677323	In the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), new olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are persistently generated to replace lost neurons throughout an organism's lifespan. This process predominantly depends on the proliferation of globose basal cells (GBCs), the actively dividing stem cells in the MOE. Here, by using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi coupled with adeno-associated virus (AAV) nose delivery approaches, we demonstrated that knockdown of miR-200b/a in the MOE resulted in supernumerary Mash1-marked GBCs and decreased numbers of differentiated OSNs, accompanied by abrogation of male behaviors. We further showed that in the MOE, miR-200b/a targets the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase TET3, which cooperates with RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) to exert their functions. Deficiencies including proliferation, differentiation, and behaviors illustrated in miR-200b/a knockdown mice were rescued by suppressing either TET3 or REST. Our work describes a mechanism of coordination of GBC proliferation and differentiation in the MOE and olfactory male behaviors through miR-200/TET3/REST signaling.	The microRNA/TET3/REST axis is required for olfactory globose basal cell proliferation and male behavior.	EMBO reports
32648345	Nutrient sensing by the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) requires its translocation to the lysosomal membrane. Upon amino acids removal, mTORC1 becomes cytosolic and inactive, yet its precise subcellular localization and the mechanism of inhibition remain elusive. Here, we identified Aster-C as a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling. Aster-C earmarked a special rough ER subdomain where it sequestered mTOR together with the GATOR2 complex to prevent mTORC1 activation during nutrient starvation. Amino acids stimulated rapid disassociation of mTORC1 from Aster-C concurrently with assembly of COP I vesicles which escorted mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane. Consequently, ablation of Aster-C led to spontaneous activation of mTORC1 and dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes, whereas inhibition of COP I vesicle biogenesis or actin dynamics prevented mTORC1 activation. Together, these findings identified Aster-C as a missing link between lysosomal trafficking and mTORC1 activation by revealing an unexpected role of COP I vesicles in mTORC1 signaling.	Aster-C coordinates with COP I vesicles to regulate lysosomal trafficking and activation of mTORC1.	EMBO reports
32715615	Activation of the type 1 interferon response is extensively connected to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Loss of function of Immunity Related GTPase M (IRGM) has also been associated to several autoimmune diseases, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we found that IRGM is a master negative regulator of the interferon response. Several nucleic acid-sensing pathways leading to interferon-stimulated gene expression are highly activated in IRGM knockout mice and human cells. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with nucleic acid sensor proteins, including cGAS and RIG-I, and mediates their p62-dependent autophagic degradation to restrain interferon signaling. Further, IRGM deficiency results in defective mitophagy leading to the accumulation of defunct leaky mitochondria that release cytosolic DAMPs and mtROS. Hence, IRGM deficiency increases not only the levels of the sensors, but also those of the stimuli that trigger the activation of the cGAS-STING and RIG-I-MAVS signaling axes, leading to robust induction of IFN responses. Taken together, this study defines the molecular mechanisms by which IRGM maintains interferon homeostasis and protects from autoimmune diseases.	Autoimmunity gene IRGM suppresses cGAS-STING and RIG-I-MAVS signaling to control interferon response.	EMBO reports
32644293	The transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is essential for the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their function in immune homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that in natural Tregs (nTregs), FOXP3 can be regulated by polyubiquitination and deubiquitination. However, the molecular players active in this pathway, especially those modulating FOXP3 by deubiquitination in the distinct induced Treg (iTreg) lineage, remain unclear. Here, we identify the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44 (USP44) as a novel deubiquitinase for FOXP3. USP44 interacts with and stabilizes FOXP3 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin modifications. Notably, TGF-beta induces USP44 expression during iTreg differentiation. USP44 co-operates with USP7 to stabilize and deubiquitinate FOXP3. Tregs genetically lacking USP44 are less effective than their wild-type counterparts, both in vitro and in multiple in vivo models of inflammatory disease and cancer. These findings suggest that USP44 plays an important role in the post-translational regulation of Treg function and is thus a potential therapeutic target for tolerance-breaking anti-cancer immunotherapy.	The deubiquitinase USP44 promotes Treg function during inflammation by preventing FOXP3 degradation.	EMBO reports
32761762	SIRT1 is a NAD(+) -dependent deacetylase that controls key metabolic and signaling pathways, including inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor. However, the mechanisms controlling SIRT1 enzymatic activity in the context of cancer are unclear. Here, we show that the previously undescribed CSAG2 protein is a direct activator of SIRT1. CSAG2 is normally restricted to expression in the male germline but is frequently re-activated in cancers. CSAG2 is necessary for cancer cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Biochemical studies revealed that CSAG2 directly binds to and stimulates SIRT1 activity toward multiple substrates. Importantly, CSAG2 enhances SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53, inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, and improves cell survival in response to genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, CSAG2 binds SIRT1 catalytic domain and promotes activity independent of altering substrate affinity. Together, our results identify a previously undescribed mechanism for SIRT1 activation in cancer cells and highlight unanticipated approaches to therapeutically modulate SIRT1.	CSAG2 is a cancer-specific activator of SIRT1.	EMBO reports
32851774	MICU1 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that inhibits mitochondrial calcium entry; elevated MICU1 expression is characteristic of many cancers, including ovarian cancer. MICU1 induces both glycolysis and chemoresistance and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, there are currently no available interventions to normalize aberrant MICU1 expression. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-195-5p (miR-195) directly targets the 3' UTR of the MICU1 mRNA and represses MICU1 expression. Additionally, miR-195 is under-expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines, and restoring miR-195 expression reestablishes native MICU1 levels and the associated phenotypes. Stable expression of miR-195 in a human xenograft model of ovarian cancer significantly reduces tumor growth, increases tumor doubling times, and enhances overall survival. In conclusion, miR-195 controls MICU1 levels in ovarian cancer and could be exploited to normalize aberrant MICU1 expression, thus reversing both glycolysis and chemoresistance and consequently improving patient outcomes.	MicroRNA-195 controls MICU1 expression and tumor growth in ovarian cancer.	EMBO reports
32783360	RNA modifications represent a novel layer of regulation of gene expression. Functional experiments revealed that N(6) -methyladenosine (m(6) A) on messenger RNA (mRNA) plays critical roles in cell fate determination and development. m(6) A mark also resides in the decoding center of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA); however, the biological function of m(6) A on 18S rRNA is still poorly understood. Here, we report that methyltransferase-like 5 (METTL5) methylates 18S rRNA both in vivo and in vitro, which is consistent with previous reports. Deletion of Mettl5 causes a dramatic differentiation defect in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Mechanistically, the m(6) A deposited by METTL5 is involved in regulating the efficient translation of F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), a key regulator of cell differentiation. Deficiency of METTL5 reduces FBXW7 levels and leads to the accumulation of its substrate c-MYC, thereby delaying the onset of mESC differentiation. Our study uncovers an important role of METTL5-mediated 18S m(6) A in mESC differentiation through translation regulation and provides new insight into the functional significance of rRNA m(6) A.	The 18S rRNA m(6) A methyltransferase METTL5 promotes mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.	EMBO reports
32954645	Signaling via the intracellular pathogen receptors nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins NOD1 and NOD2 requires receptor interacting kinase 2 (RIPK2), an adaptor kinase that can be targeted for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of how RIPK2 contributes to NOD signaling are not completely understood. We generated FLAG-tagged RIPK2 knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to study NOD signaling mechanisms at the endogenous level. Using cells from these mice, we were able to generate a detailed map of post-translational modifications on RIPK2. Similar to other reports, we did not detect ubiquitination of RIPK2 lysine 209 during NOD2 signaling. However, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified a new regulatory region on RIPK2, which dictates the crucial interaction with the E3 ligase XIAP and downstream signaling outcomes.	A regulatory region on RIPK2 is required for XIAP binding and NOD signaling activity.	EMBO reports
33030802	Prominin-1 (Prom1) is a major cell surface marker of cancer stem cells, but its physiological functions in the liver have not been elucidated. We analyzed the levels of mRNA transcripts in serum-starved primary WT (Prom1(+/+) ) and KO (Prom1(-/-) ) mouse hepatocytes using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and found that CREB target genes were downregulated. This initial observation led us to determine that Prom1 deficiency inhibited cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation and gluconeogenesis, but not cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation, in glucagon-, epinephrine-, or forskolin-treated liver tissues and primary hepatocytes, and mitigated glucagon-induced hyperglycemia. Because Prom1 interacted with radixin, Prom1 deficiency prevented radixin from localizing to the plasma membrane. Moreover, systemic adenoviral knockdown of radixin inhibited CREB activation and gluconeogenesis in glucagon-treated liver tissues and primary hepatocytes, and mitigated glucagon-elicited hyperglycemia. Based on these results, we conclude that Prom1 regulates hepatic PKA signaling via radixin functioning as an A kinase-anchored protein (AKAP).	Prominin-1-Radixin axis controls hepatic gluconeogenesis by regulating PKA activity.	EMBO reports
33016573	A microdeletion within human chromosome 5q14.3 has been associated with the occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and intellectual disability, and MEF2C haploinsufficiency was identified as main cause. Here, we report that a brain-enriched long non-coding RNA, NDIME, is located near the MEF2C locus and is required for normal neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). NDIME interacts with EZH2, the major component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and blocks EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the Mef2c promoter, promoting MEF2C transcription. Moreover, the expression levels of both NDIME and MEF2C were strongly downregulated in the hippocampus of a mouse model of autism, and the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of NDIME in the hippocampus of these mice significantly increased MEF2C expression and ameliorated autism-like behaviors. The results of this study reveal an epigenetic mechanism by which NDIME regulates MEF2C transcription and neural differentiation and suggest potential effects and therapeutic approaches of the NDIME/MEF2C axis in autism.

33140520	The ER-bound kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), regulates the phylogenetically most conserved arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the complex biology and pathology regulated by mammalian IRE1 cannot be fully explained by IRE1's one known, specific RNA target, X box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) or the RNA substrates of IRE1-dependent RNA degradation (RIDD) activity. Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by IRE1's RNase activity. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3 ) 5-phosphatase-2 (INPPL1) is a direct target of miR-2137, which controls PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in macrophages. The modulation of cellular PI(3,4,5)P3 /PIP2 ratio and anabolic mTOR signaling by the IRE1-induced miR-2137 demonstrates how the ER can provide a critical input into cell growth decisions.	Inositol-requiring enzyme-1 regulates phosphoinositide signaling lipids and macrophage growth.	EMBO reports
33025734	The mechanism and regulation of fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes/vacuoles are still only partially understood in both yeast and mammals. In yeast, this fusion step requires SNARE proteins, the homotypic vacuole fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, the RAB7 GTPase Ypt7, and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Mon1-Ccz1. We and others recently identified Ykt6 as the autophagosomal SNARE protein. However, it has not been resolved when and how lipid-anchored Ykt6 is recruited onto autophagosomes. Here, we show that Ykt6 is recruited at an early stage of the formation of these carriers through a mechanism that depends on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident Dsl1 complex and COPII-coated vesicles. Importantly, Ykt6 activity on autophagosomes is regulated by the Atg1 kinase complex, which inhibits Ykt6 through direct phosphorylation. Thus, our findings indicate that the Ykt6 pool on autophagosomal membranes is kept inactive by Atg1 phosphorylation, and once an autophagosome is ready to fuse with vacuole, Ykt6 dephosphorylation allows its engagement in the fusion event.	Function of the SNARE Ykt6 on autophagosomes requires the Dsl1 complex and the Atg1 kinase complex.	EMBO reports
33047485	The function and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are tightly regulated by signals originating from their niche environment. Skeletal myofibers are a principle component of the MuSC niche and are in direct contact with the muscle stem cells. Here, we show that Myf6 establishes a ligand/receptor interaction between muscle stem cells and their associated muscle fibers. Our data show that Myf6 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of myokines and muscle-secreted proteins in skeletal myofibers, including EGF. EGFR signaling blocks p38 MAP kinase-induced differentiation of muscle stem cells. Homozygous deletion of Myf6 causes a significant reduction in the ability of muscle to produce EGF, leading to a deregulation in EGFR signaling. Consequently, although Myf6-knockout mice are born with a normal muscle stem cell compartment, they undergo a progressive reduction in their stem cell pool during postnatal life due to spontaneous exit from quiescence. Taken together, our data uncover a novel role for Myf6 in promoting the expression of key myokines, such as EGF, in the muscle fiber which prevents muscle stem cell exhaustion by blocking their premature differentiation.	Myf6/MRF4 is a myogenic niche regulator required for the maintenance of the muscle stem cell pool.	EMBO reports
33073493	mascRNA is a small cytoplasmic RNA derived from the lncRNA MALAT1. After being processed by the tRNA processing enzymes RNase P and RNase Z, mascRNA undergoes CCA addition like tRNAs and folds into a tRNA-like cloverleaf structure. While MALAT1 functions in multiple cellular processes, the role of mascRNA was largely unknown. Here, we show that mascRNA binds directly to the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) component glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QARS). mascRNA promotes global protein translation and cell proliferation by positively regulating QARS protein levels. Our results uncover a role of mascRNA that is independent of MALAT1, but could be part of the molecular mechanism of MALAT1's function in cancer, and provide a paradigm for understanding tRNA-like structures in mammalian cells.	The tRNA-like small noncoding RNA mascRNA promotes global protein translation.	EMBO reports
33063451	Tumor cells subvert immune surveillance by harnessing signals from immune checkpoints to acquire immune resistance. The protein PD-L1 is an important component in this process, and inhibition of PD-L1 elicits durable anti-tumor responses in a broad spectrum of cancers. However, immune checkpoint inhibition that target known pathways is not universally effective. A better understanding of the genetic repertoire underlying these processes is necessary to expand our knowledge in tumor immunity and to facilitate identification of alternative targets. Here, we present a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human cancer cells to identify genes that confer tumors with the ability to evade the cytotoxic effects of the immune system. We show that the transcriptional regulator MLLT6 (AF17) is required for efficient PD-L1 protein expression and cell surface presentation in cancer cells. MLLT6 depletion alleviates suppression of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell-mediated cytolysis. Furthermore, cancer cells lacking MLLT6 exhibit impaired STAT1 signaling and are insensitive to interferon-gamma-induced stimulation of IDO1, GBP5, CD74, and MHC class II genes. Collectively, our findings establish MLLT6 as a regulator of oncogenic and interferon-gamma-associated immune resistance.	MLLT6 maintains PD-L1 expression and mediates tumor immune resistance.

33058421	The tumor suppressor Merlin/NF2, a key activator of the Hippo pathway in growth control, is regulated by phosphorylation. However, it is uncertain whether additional post-translational modifications regulate Merlin. Here, we show that ubiquitination is required to activate Merlin in the Hippo pathway. Ubiquitinated Merlin is mostly conjugated by one or two ubiquitin molecules. Such modification is promoted by serine 518 dephosphorylation in response to Ca(2+) signaling or cell detachment. Merlin ubiquitination is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L, which requires a scaffold protein, AMOTL1, to approach Merlin. Several NF2-patient-derived Merlin mutations disrupt its binding to AMOTL1 and its regulation by the AMOTL1-NEDD4L apparatus. Lysine (K) 396 is the major ubiquitin conjugation residue. Disruption of Merlin ubiquitination by the K396R mutation or NEDD4L depletion diminishes its binding to Lats1 and inhibits Lats1 activation. These effects are also accompanied by loss of Merlin's anti-mitogenic and tumor suppressive properties. Thus, we propose that dephosphorylation and ubiquitination compose an intramolecular relay to activate Merlin functions in activating the Hippo pathway during growth control.	NEDD4L-mediated Merlin ubiquitination facilitates Hippo pathway activation.	EMBO reports
33043604	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer with a 5-year overall survival rate of 50%. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the disease process, and to identify improved therapeutic strategies. Previously, we found the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) EGFR long non-coding downstream RNA (ELDR) induced in a mouse tongue cancer model; however, its functional role in human oral cancer remained unknown. Here, we show that ELDR is highly expressed in OSCC patient samples and in cell lines. Overexpression of ELDR in normal non-tumorigenic oral keratinocytes induces cell proliferation, colony formation, and PCNA expression. We also show that ELDR depletion reduces OSCC cell proliferation and PCNA expression. Proteomics data identifies the RNA binding protein ILF3 as an interacting partner of ELDR. We further show that the ELDR-ILF3 axis regulates Cyclin E1 expression and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Intratumoral injection of ELDR-specific siRNA reduces OSCC and PDX tumor growth in mice. These findings provide molecular insight into the role of ELDR in oral cancer and demonstrate that targeting ELDR has promising therapeutic potential.	Long non-coding RNA ELDR enhances oral cancer growth by promoting ILF3-cyclin E1 signaling.	EMBO reports
33185004	The retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (RB) regulates a number of diverse cellular functions including differentiation, angiogenesis, chromatin remodelling, senescence and apoptosis. The best-characterised function of RB is cell cycle regulation, and it has been considered a phosphoprotein regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. In its hypophosphorylated form, RB binds the transcription factor E2F1, arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Here, we show that MDM2 controls the cell cycle through synthesis and degradation of RB protein in a cell cycle condition-dependent fashion. MDM2 induces G1 cell cycle arrest by enhancing the translation of the RB mRNA under genotoxic stress. Translation requires direct interaction between the RB mRNA and the MDM2 protein that accompanies the RB mRNA to the polysomes. However, MDM2 ubiquitinates and degrades RB protein at the G2/M phase under genotoxic stress. The ATM phosphomimetic mutant MDM2(S395D) corroborates that the effect on the RB levels is dependent on the DNA damage. These results provide the basis of a dual regulatory mechanism by which MDM2 controls cell cycle progression during DNA damage.	MDM2 regulates RB levels during genotoxic stress.	EMBO reports
33393215	Nrf2 signaling is vital for protecting cells against oxidative stress. However, its hyperactivation is frequently found in liver cancer through excessive build-up of p62/SQSTM1 bodies that sequester Keap1, an adaptor of the E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for Nrf2. Here, we report that the Bax-binding protein MOAP-1 regulates p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signaling through disruption of p62 bodies. Upon induction of cellular stresses that stimulate formation of p62 bodies, MOAP-1 is recruited to p62 bodies and reduces their levels independent of the autophagy pathway. MOAP-1 interacts with the PB1-ZZ domains of p62 and interferes with its self-oligomerization and liquid-liquid phase separation, thereby disassembling the p62 bodies. Loss of MOAP-1 can lead to marked upregulation of p62 bodies, enhanced sequestration of Keap1 by p62 and hyperactivation of Nrf2 antioxidant target genes. MOAP-1-deficient mice exhibit an elevated tumor burden with excessive levels of p62 bodies and Nrf2 signaling in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model. Together, our data define MOAP-1 as a negative regulator of Nrf2 signaling via dissociation of p62 bodies.	MOAP-1-mediated dissociation of p62/SQSTM1 bodies releases Keap1 and suppresses Nrf2 signaling.	EMBO reports
33245190	The denitrosylase S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) has been suggested to sustain mitochondrial removal by autophagy (mitophagy), functionally linking S-nitrosylation to cell senescence and aging. In this study, we provide evidence that GSNOR is induced at the translational level in response to hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial ROS. The use of selective pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA demonstrates that GSNOR induction is an event downstream of the redox-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn phosphorylates and activates CHK2 and p53 as intermediate players of this signaling cascade. The modulation of ATM/GSNOR axis, or the expression of a redox-insensitive ATM mutant influences cell sensitivity to nitrosative and oxidative stress, impairs mitophagy and affects cell survival. Remarkably, this interplay modulates T-cell activation, supporting the conclusion that GSNOR is a key molecular effector of the antioxidant function of ATM and providing new clues to comprehend the pleiotropic effects of ATM in the context of immune function.	Redox activation of ATM enhances GSNOR translation to sustain mitophagy and tolerance to oxidative stress.	EMBO reports
33372411	Lysine succinylation (Ksucc) is an evolutionarily conserved and widespread post-translational modification. Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) is a type B histone acetyltransferase, regulating the acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins. However, the role of HAT1 in succinylation modulation remains unclear. Here, we employ a quantitative proteomics approach to study succinylation in HepG2 cancer cells and find that HAT1 modulates lysine succinylation on various proteins including histones and non-histones. HAT1 succinylates histone H3 on K122, contributing to epigenetic regulation and gene expression in cancer cells. Moreover, HAT1 catalyzes the succinylation of PGAM1 on K99, resulting in its increased enzymatic activity and the stimulation of glycolytic flux in cancer cells. Clinically, HAT1 is significantly elevated in liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Functionally, HAT1 succinyltransferase activity and the succinylation of PGAM1 by HAT1 play critical roles in promoting tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we conclude that HAT1 is a succinyltransferase for histones and non-histones in tumorigenesis.	Histone acetyltransferase 1 is a succinyltransferase for histones and non-histones and promotes tumorigenesis.	EMBO reports
33369872	Dynamic control of ubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes is essential for almost all biological processes. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is part of the SAGA complex and catalyzes the removal of mono-ubiquitination from histones H2A and H2B, thereby regulating gene transcription. However, novel roles for USP22 have emerged recently, such as tumor development and cell death. Apart from apoptosis, the relevance of USP22 in other programmed cell death pathways still remains unclear. Here, we describe a novel role for USP22 in controlling necroptotic cell death in human tumor cell lines. Loss of USP22 expression significantly delays TNFalpha/Smac mimetic/zVAD.fmk (TBZ)-induced necroptosis, without affecting TNFalpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation or extrinsic apoptosis. Ubiquitin remnant profiling identified receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) lysines 42, 351, and 518 as novel, USP22-regulated ubiquitination sites during necroptosis. Importantly, mutation of RIPK3 K518 reduced necroptosis-associated RIPK3 ubiquitination and amplified necrosome formation and necroptotic cell death. In conclusion, we identify a novel role of USP22 in necroptosis and further elucidate the relevance of RIPK3 ubiquitination as crucial regulator of necroptotic cell death.	USP22 controls necroptosis by regulating receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 ubiquitination.	EMBO reports
33410264	Sleep homeostasis is crucial for sleep regulation. The role of epigenetic regulation in sleep homeostasis is unestablished. Previous studies showed that octopamine is important for sleep homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanism of octopamine reception in sleep is unknown. In this study, we identify an epigenetic regulatory cascade (Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R) that modulates the octopamine receptor in Drosophila. We demonstrate that stuxnet positively regulates Octbeta2R through repression of Polycomb in the ellipsoid body of the adult fly brain and that Octbeta2R is one of the major receptors mediating octopamine function in sleep homeostasis. In response to octopamine, Octbeta2R transcription is inhibited as a result of stuxnet downregulation. This feedback through the Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octbeta2R cascade is crucial for sleep homeostasis regulation.

33369866	Energy storage and growth are coordinated in response to nutrient status of animals. How nutrient-regulated signaling pathways control these processes in vivo remains insufficiently understood. Here, we establish an atypical MAP kinase, ERK7, as an inhibitor of adiposity and growth in Drosophila. ERK7 mutant larvae display elevated triacylglycerol (TAG) stores and accelerated growth rate, while overexpressed ERK7 is sufficient to inhibit lipid storage and growth. ERK7 expression is elevated upon fasting and ERK7 mutant larvae display impaired survival during nutrient deprivation. ERK7 acts in the fat body, the insect counterpart of liver and adipose tissue, where it controls the subcellular localization of chromatin-binding protein PWP1, a growth-promoting downstream effector of mTOR. PWP1 maintains the expression of sugarbabe, encoding a lipogenic Gli-similar family transcription factor. Both PWP1 and Sugarbabe are necessary for the increased growth and adiposity phenotypes of ERK7 loss-of-function animals. In conclusion, ERK7 is an anti-anabolic kinase that inhibits lipid storage and growth while promoting survival on fasting conditions.	Coordinated control of adiposity and growth by anti-anabolic kinase ERK7.	EMBO reports
33393230	Although iron is required for cell proliferation, iron-dependent programmed cell death serves as a critical barrier to tumor growth and metastasis. Emerging evidence suggests that iron-mediated lipid oxidation also facilitates immune eradication of cancer. However, the regulatory mechanisms of iron metabolism in cancer remain unclear. Here we identify OTUD1 as the deubiquitinase of iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IREB2), selectively reduced in colorectal cancer. Clinically, downregulation of OTUD1 is highly correlated with poor outcome of cancer. Mechanistically, OTUD1 promotes transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC)-mediated iron transportation through deubiquitinating and stabilizing IREB2, leading to increased ROS generation and ferroptosis. Moreover, the presence of OTUD1 promotes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which in turn recruits the leukocytes and strengthens host immune response. Reciprocally, depletion of OTUD1 limits tumor-reactive T-cell accumulation and exacerbates colon cancer progression. Our data demonstrate that OTUD1 plays a stimulatory role in iron transportation and highlight the importance of OTUD1-IREB2-TFRC signaling axis in host antitumor immunity.	The deubiquitinase OTUD1 enhances iron transport and potentiates host antitumor immunity.	EMBO reports
33345445	Metabolic reprogramming of non-cancer cells residing in a tumor microenvironment, as a result of the adaptations to cancer-derived metabolic and non-metabolic factors, is an emerging aspect of cancer-host interaction. We show that in normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts, breast cancer-secreted extracellular vesicles suppress mTOR signaling upon amino acid stimulation to globally reduce mRNA translation. This is through delivery of cancer-derived miR-105 and miR-204, which target RAGC, a component of Rag GTPases that regulate mTORC1 signaling. Following amino acid starvation and subsequent re-feeding, (13) C-arginine labeling of de novo synthesized proteins shows selective translation of proteins that cluster to specific cellular functional pathways. The repertoire of these newly synthesized proteins is altered in fibroblasts treated with cancer-derived extracellular vesicles, in addition to the overall suppressed protein synthesis. In human breast tumors, RAGC protein levels are inversely correlated with miR-105 in the stroma. Our results suggest that through educating fibroblasts to reduce and re-prioritize mRNA translation, cancer cells rewire the metabolic fluxes of amino acid pool and dynamically regulate stroma-produced proteins during periodic nutrient fluctuations.	Cancer-secreted miRNAs regulate amino-acid-induced mTORC1 signaling and fibroblast protein synthesis.	EMBO reports
33480129	Molecular switches are essential modules in signaling networks and transcriptional reprogramming. Here, we describe a role for small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO as a molecular switch in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we compare the endogenous SUMO proteomes of HeLa cells before and after EGF stimulation. Thereby, we identify a small group of transcriptional coregulators including IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BPL as novel players in EGFR signaling. Comparison of cells expressing wild type or SUMOylation-deficient IRF2BP1 indicates that transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins is important for appropriate expression of immediate early genes including dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1, MKP-1) and the transcription factor ATF3. We find that IRF2BP1 is a repressor, whose transient deSUMOylation on the DUSP1 promoter allows-and whose timely reSUMOylation restricts-DUSP1 transcription. Our work thus provides a paradigm how comparative SUMO proteome analyses serve to reveal novel regulators in signal transduction and transcription.	Transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins controls early transcription in EGFR signaling.	EMBO reports
33512761	Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key players in chromatin regulation. The identification of novel histone acylations raises important questions regarding their role in transcription. In this study, we characterize the role of an acylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer, H3K122 succinylation (H3K122succ), in chromatin function and transcription. Using chromatin succinylated at H3K122 in in vitro transcription assays, we show that the presence of H3K122succ is sufficient to stimulate transcription. In line with this, we found in our ChIP assays H3K122succ enriched on promoters of active genes and H3K122succ enrichment scaling with gene expression levels. Furthermore, we show that the co-activators p300/CBP can succinylate H3K122 and identify sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a new desuccinylase. By applying single molecule FRET assays, we demonstrate a direct effect of H3K122succ on nucleosome stability, indicating an important role for histone succinylation in modulating chromatin dynamics. Together, these data provide the first insights into the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by H3K122succ.	Succinylation of H3K122 destabilizes nucleosomes and enhances transcription.

33554439	Amino acid restriction is among promising potential cancer treatment strategies. However, cancer cells employ a multitude of mechanisms to mount resistance to amino acid restriction, which impede the latter's clinical development. Here we show that MAPK signaling activation in asparagine-restricted melanoma cells impairs GSK3-beta-mediated c-MYC degradation. In turn, elevated c-MYC supports ATF4 translational induction by enhancing the expression of the amino acid transporter SLC7A5, increasing the uptake of essential amino acids, and the subsequent maintenance of mTORC1 activity in asparagine-restricted melanoma cells. Blocking the MAPK-c-MYC-SLC7A5 signaling axis cooperates with asparagine restriction to effectively suppress melanoma cell proliferation. This work reveals a previously unknown axis of cancer cell adaptation to asparagine restriction and informs mechanisms that may be targeted for enhanced therapeutic efficacy of asparagine limiting strategies.	MAPK signaling regulates c-MYC for melanoma cell adaptation to asparagine restriction.	EMBO reports
33590678	The eukaryotic replisome is disassembled in each cell cycle, dependent upon ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase. Studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis have revealed surprising evolutionary diversity in the ubiquitin ligases that control CMG ubiquitylation, but regulated disassembly of the mammalian replisome has yet to be explored. Here, we describe a model system for studying the ubiquitylation and chromatin extraction of the mammalian CMG replisome, based on mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that the ubiquitin ligase CUL2(LRR1) is required for ubiquitylation of the CMG-MCM7 subunit during S-phase, leading to disassembly by the p97 ATPase. Moreover, a second pathway of CMG disassembly is activated during mitosis, dependent upon the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in primordial dwarfism and mis-regulated in various cancers. These findings indicate that replisome disassembly in diverse metazoa is regulated by a conserved pair of ubiquitin ligases, distinct from those present in other eukaryotes.	CUL2(LRR1) , TRAIP and p97 control CMG helicase disassembly in the mammalian cell cycle.	EMBO reports
33554448	Mitophagy is an essential cellular autophagic process that selectively removes superfluous and damaged mitochondria, and it is coordinated with mitochondrial biogenesis to fine tune the quantity and quality of mitochondria. Coordination between these two opposing processes to maintain the functional mitochondrial network is of paramount importance for normal cellular and organismal metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here we report that PGC-1alpha and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic adaptation, also transcriptionally upregulate the gene encoding FUNDC1, a previously characterized mitophagy receptor, in response to cold stress in brown fat tissue. NRF1 binds to the classic consensus site in the promoter of Fundc1 to upregulate its expression and to enhance mitophagy through its interaction with LC3. Specific knockout of Fundc1 in BAT results in reduced mitochondrial turnover and accumulation of functionally compromised mitochondria, leading to impaired adaptive thermogenesis. Our results demonstrate that FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy is directly coupled with mitochondrial biogenesis through the PGC-1alpha/NRF1 pathway, which dictates mitochondrial quantity, quality, and turnover and contributes to adaptive thermogenesis.	Mitophagy receptor FUNDC1 is regulated by PGC-1alpha/NRF1 to fine tune mitochondrial homeostasis.	EMBO reports
33586907	Transition from proliferative-to-invasive phenotypes promotes metastasis and therapy resistance in melanoma. Reversion of the invasive phenotype, however, is challenged by the poor understanding of mechanisms underlying its maintenance. Here, we report that the lncRNA TINCR is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma and its silencing increases the expression levels of invasive markers, in vitro migration, in vivo tumor growth, and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The critical mediator is ATF4, a central player of the integrated stress response (ISR), which is activated in TINCR-depleted cells in the absence of starvation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. TINCR depletion increases global protein synthesis and induces translational reprogramming, leading to increased translation of mRNAs encoding ATF4 and other ISR proteins. Strikingly, re-expression of TINCR in metastatic melanoma suppresses the invasive phenotype, reduces numbers of tumor-initiating cells and metastasis formation, and increases drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, TINCR interacts with mRNAs associated with the invasive phenotype, including ATF4, preventing their binding to ribosomes. Thus, TINCR is a suppressor of the melanoma invasive phenotype, which functions in nutrient-rich conditions by repressing translation of selected ISR RNAs.	Long non-coding RNA TINCR suppresses metastatic melanoma dissemination by preventing ATF4 translation.	EMBO reports
33426808	The MYC oncoprotein activates and represses gene expression in a transcription-dependent or transcription-independent manner. Modification of mRNA emerges as a key gene expression regulatory nexus. We sought to determine whether MYC alters mRNA modifications and report here that MYC promotes cancer progression by down-regulating N6-methyladenosine (m(6) A) preferentially in transcripts of a subset of MYC-repressed genes (MRGs). We find that MYC activates the expression of ALKBH5 and reduces m(6) A levels in the mRNA of the selected MRGs SPI1 and PHF12. We also show that MYC-regulated m(6) A controls the translation of MRG mRNA via the specific m(6) A reader YTHDF3. Finally, we find that inhibition of ALKBH5, or overexpression of SPI1 or PHF12, effectively suppresses the growth of MYC-deregulated B-cell lymphomas, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which MYC suppresses gene expression by altering m(6) A modifications in selected MRG transcripts promotes cancer progression.	MYC promotes cancer progression by modulating m(6) A modifications to suppress target gene translation.	EMBO reports
33565211	The ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to switch between quiescence and proliferation is crucial for brain development and homeostasis. Increasing evidence suggests that variants of histone lysine methyltransferases including KMT5A are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the function of KMT5A/Pr-set7/SETD8 in the central nervous system is not well established. Here, we show that Drosophila Pr-Set7 is a novel regulator of NSC reactivation. Loss of function of pr-set7 causes a delay in NSC reactivation and loss of H4K20 monomethylation in the brain. Through NSC-specific in vivo profiling, we demonstrate that Pr-set7 binds to the promoter region of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) and Wnt pathway transcriptional co-activator earthbound1/jerky (ebd1). Further validation indicates that Pr-set7 is required for the expression of cdk1 and ebd1 in the brain. Similar to Pr-set7, Cdk1 and Ebd1 promote NSC reactivation. Finally, overexpression of Cdk1 and Ebd1 significantly suppressed NSC reactivation defects observed in pr-set7-depleted brains. Therefore, Pr-set7 promotes NSC reactivation by regulating Wnt signaling and cell cycle progression. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of mammalian KMT5A/PR-SET7/SETD8 during brain development.	Histone lysine methyltransferase Pr-set7/SETD8 promotes neural stem cell reactivation.

33586867	Regulation of mRNA stability and translation plays a critical role in determining protein abundance within cells. Processing bodies (P-bodies) are critical regulators of these processes. Here, we report that the Pim1 and 3 protein kinases bind to the P-body protein enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) and phosphorylate EDC3 on serine (S)161, thereby modifying P-body assembly. EDC3 phosphorylation is highly elevated in many tumor types, is reduced upon treatment of cells with kinase inhibitors, and blocks the localization of EDC3 to P-bodies. Prostate cancer cells harboring an EDC3 S161A mutation show markedly decreased growth, migration, and invasion in tissue culture and in xenograft models. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, the expression of integrin beta1 and alpha6 mRNA and protein is reduced in these mutated cells. These results demonstrate that EDC3 phosphorylation regulates multiple cancer-relevant functions and suggest that modulation of P-body activity may represent a new paradigm for cancer treatment.	EDC3 phosphorylation regulates growth and invasion through controlling P-body formation and dynamics.	EMBO reports
33594776	Notch signaling and epigenetic factors are known to play critical roles in regulating tissue homeostasis in most multicellular organisms, but how Notch signaling coordinates with epigenetic modulators to control differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify heterochromatin protein 1c (HP1c) as an essential epigenetic regulator of gut homeostasis in Drosophila. Specifically, we observe that HP1c loss-of-function phenotypes resemble those observed after Notch signaling perturbation and that HP1c interacts genetically with components of the Notch pathway. HP1c represses the transcription of Notch target genes by directly interacting with Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), the key transcription factor of Notch signaling. Moreover, phenotypes caused by depletion of HP1c in Drosophila can be rescued by expressing human HP1gamma, suggesting that HP1gamma functions similar to HP1c in Drosophila. Taken together, our findings reveal an essential role of HP1c in normal development and gut homeostasis by suppressing Notch signaling.	HP1c regulates development and gut homeostasis by suppressing Notch signaling through Su(H).	EMBO reports
33786993	The tumour suppressors RNF43 and ZNRF3 play a central role in development and tissue homeostasis by promoting the turnover of the Wnt receptors LRP6 and Frizzled (FZD). The stem cell growth factor R-spondin induces auto-ubiquitination and membrane clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 to promote Wnt signalling. However, the deubiquitinase stabilising ZNRF3/RNF43 at the plasma membrane remains unknown. Here, we show that the USP42 antagonises R-spondin by protecting ZNRF3/RNF43 from ubiquitin-dependent clearance. USP42 binds to the Dishevelled interacting region (DIR) of ZNRF3 and stalls the R-spondin-LGR4-ZNRF3 ternary complex by deubiquitinating ZNRF3. Accordingly, USP42 increases the turnover of LRP6 and Frizzled (FZD) receptors and inhibits Wnt signalling. Furthermore, we show that USP42 functions as a roadblock for paracrine Wnt signalling in colon cancer cells and mouse small intestinal organoids. We provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation R-spondin and conclude that USP42 is crucial for ZNRF3/RNF43 stabilisation at the cell surface.	USP42 protects ZNRF3/RNF43 from R-spondin-dependent clearance and inhibits Wnt signalling.	EMBO reports
33655623	Treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains challenging due to a lack of effective targeted therapies. Dysregulated glucose uptake and metabolism are essential for TNBC growth. Identifying the molecular drivers and mechanisms underlying the metabolic vulnerability of TNBC is key to exploiting dysregulated cancer metabolism for therapeutic applications. Mitogen-inducible gene-6 (MIG-6) has long been thought of as a feedback inhibitor that targets activated EGFR and suppresses the growth of tumors driven by constitutive activated mutant EGFR. Here, our bioinformatics and histological analyses uncover that MIG-6 is upregulated in TNBC and that MIG-6 upregulation is positively correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in TNBC. Metabolic arrays and functional assays reveal that MIG-6 drives glucose metabolism reprogramming toward glycolysis. Mechanistically, MIG-6 recruits HAUSP deubiquitinase for stabilizing HIF1alpha protein expression and the subsequent upregulation of GLUT1 and other HIF1alpha-regulated glycolytic genes, substantiating the comprehensive regulation of MIG-6 in glucose metabolism. Moreover, our mouse studies demonstrate that MIG-6 regulates GLUT1 expression in tumors and subsequent tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, this work reveals that MIG-6 is a novel prognosis biomarker, metabolism regulator, and molecular driver of TNBC.	MIG-6 is essential for promoting glucose metabolic reprogramming and tumor growth in triple-negative breast cancer.	EMBO reports
33779025	Replication stress, a major cause of genome instability in cycling cells, is mainly prevented by the ATR-dependent replication stress response pathway in somatic cells. However, the replication stress response pathway in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) may be different due to alterations in cell cycle phase length. The transcription factor MYBL2, which is implicated in cell cycle regulation, is expressed a hundred to a thousand-fold more in ESCs compared with somatic cells. Here we show that MYBL2 activates ATM and suppresses replication stress in ESCs. Consequently, loss of MYBL2 or inhibition of ATM or Mre11 in ESCs results in replication fork slowing, increased fork stalling and elevated origin firing. Additionally, we demonstrate that inhibition of CDC7 activity rescues replication stress induced by MYBL2 loss and ATM inhibition, suggesting that uncontrolled new origin firing may underlie the replication stress phenotype resulting from loss/inhibition of MYBL2 and ATM. Overall, our study proposes that in addition to ATR, a MYBL2-MRN-ATM replication stress response pathway functions in ESCs to control DNA replication initiation and prevent genome instability.	MYBL2 and ATM suppress replication stress in pluripotent stem cells.	EMBO reports
33733573	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can also be activated by some Group 9/10 transition metals, which is believed to mediate immune hypersensitivity reactions. In this work, we test whether TLR4 can be activated by the Group 10 metal platinum and the platinum-based chemotherapeutic cisplatin. Cisplatin is invaluable in childhood cancer treatment but its use is limited due to a permanent hearing loss (cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, CIO) adverse effect. We demonstrate that platinum and cisplatin activate pathways downstream of TLR4 to a similar extent as the known TLR4 agonists LPS and nickel. We further show that TLR4 is required for cisplatin-induced inflammatory, oxidative, and cell death responses in hair cells in vitro and for hair cell damage in vivo. Finally, we identify a TLR4 small molecule inhibitor able to curtail cisplatin toxicity in vitro. Thus, our findings indicate that TLR4 is a promising therapeutic target to mitigate CIO.	Toll-like receptor 4 is activated by platinum and contributes to cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.	EMBO reports
33738926	Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic condensates associated with protein misfolding diseases. They sequester stalled mRNAs and signaling factors, such as the mTORC1 subunit raptor, suggesting that SGs coordinate cell growth during and after stress. However, the molecular mechanisms linking SG dynamics and signaling remain undefined. We report that the chaperone Hsp90 is required for SG dissolution. Hsp90 binds and stabilizes the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3) in the cytosol. Upon Hsp90 inhibition, DYRK3 dissociates from Hsp90 and becomes inactive. Inactive DYRK3 is subjected to two different fates: it either partitions into SGs, where it is protected from irreversible aggregation, or it is degraded. In the presence of Hsp90, DYRK3 is active and promotes SG disassembly, restoring mTORC1 signaling and translation. Thus, Hsp90 links stress adaptation and cell growth by regulating the activity of a key kinase involved in condensate disassembly and translation restoration.	Hsp90-mediated regulation of DYRK3 couples stress granule disassembly and growth via mTORC1 signaling.	EMBO reports
33769697	Psoriasis is mainly characterized by abnormal hyperplasia of keratinocytes and immune cells infiltrating into the dermis and epidermis. Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) is a highly conserved HECT type E3 ligase that plays an important role in regulating physiological and pathological processes. Here, we identify NEDD4L as a negative regulator of psoriasis. Nedd4l significantly inhibits imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin hyperplasia, and this effect is attributed to the inhibitory effect of NEDD4L on IL-6/GP130 signaling in keratinocytes. Mechanistically, NEDD4L directly interacts with GP130 and mediates its Lys-27-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the expression of NEDD4L is downregulated in the epidermis from IMQ-treated mice and psoriasis patients and negatively correlates with the protein levels of GP130 and p-STAT3 in clinical samples. Collectively, we uncover an inhibitory role of NEDD4L in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and suggest a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of psoriasis.	E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L negatively regulates keratinocyte hyperplasia by promoting GP130 degradation.	EMBO reports
33860601	Dishevelled (DVL) critically regulates Wnt signaling and contributes to a wide spectrum of diseases and is important in normal and pathophysiological settings. However, how it mediates diverse cellular functions remains poorly understood. Recent discoveries have revealed that constitutive Wnt pathway activation contributes to breast cancer malignancy, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown and very few studies have examined the nuclear role of DVL. Here, we have performed DVL3 ChIP-seq analyses and identify novel target genes bound by DVL3. We show that DVL3 depletion alters KMT2D binding to novel targets and changes their epigenetic marks and mRNA levels. We further demonstrate that DVL3 inhibition leads to decreased tumor growth in two different breast cancer models in vivo. Our data uncover new DVL3 functions through its regulation of multiple genes involved in developmental biology, antigen presentation, metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and tumorigenesis. Overall, our study provides unique insight into the function of nuclear DVL, which helps to define its role in mediating aberrant Wnt signaling.	Nuclear Dishevelled targets gene regulatory regions and promotes tumor growth.	EMBO reports
33852194	SUMOylation plays a crucial role in regulating diverse cellular processes including ribosome biogenesis. Proteomic analyses and experimental evidence showed that a number of nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis are modified by SUMO. However, how these proteins are SUMOylated in cells is less understood. Here, we report that USP36, a nucleolar deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), promotes nucleolar SUMOylation. Overexpression of USP36 enhances nucleolar SUMOylation, whereas its knockdown or genetic deletion reduces the levels of SUMOylation. USP36 interacts with SUMO2 and Ubc9 and directly mediates SUMOylation in cells and in vitro. We show that USP36 promotes the SUMOylation of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) components Nop58 and Nhp2 in cells and in vitro and their binding to snoRNAs. It also promotes the SUMOylation of snoRNP components Nop56 and DKC1. Functionally, we show that knockdown of USP36 markedly impairs rRNA processing and translation. Thus, USP36 promotes snoRNP group SUMOylation and is critical for ribosome biogenesis and protein translation.	The deubiquitinase USP36 promotes snoRNP group SUMOylation and is essential for ribosome biogenesis.	EMBO reports
33900016	Mutations in the chromatin remodeller-coding gene CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome (CS). CS features include moderate to severe neurological and behavioural problems, clinically characterized by intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. To investigate the poorly characterized neurobiological role of CHD7, we here generate a zebrafish chd7(-/-) model. chd7(-/-) mutants have less GABAergic neurons and exhibit a hyperactivity behavioural phenotype. The GABAergic neuron defect is at least in part due to downregulation of the CHD7 direct target gene paqr3b, and subsequent upregulation of MAPK/ERK signalling, which is also dysregulated in CHD7 mutant human cells. Through a phenotype-based screen in chd7(-/-) zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that the small molecule ephedrine restores normal levels of MAPK/ERK signalling and improves both GABAergic defects and behavioural anomalies. We conclude that chd7 promotes paqr3b expression and that this is required for normal GABAergic network development. This work provides insight into the neuropathogenesis associated with CHD7 deficiency and identifies a promising compound for further preclinical studies.	Chromatin remodeller CHD7 is required for GABAergic neuron development by promoting PAQR3 expression.	EMBO reports
33855783	Pathological TDP-43 aggregation is characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP); however, how TDP-43 aggregation and function are regulated remain poorly understood. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 suppresses ALS-associated proteinopathies and promotes TDP-43's splicing function. Biochemical and cell-based assays indicate that OGT's catalytic activity suppresses TDP-43 aggregation and hyperphosphorylation, whereas abolishment of TDP-43 O-GlcNAcylation impairs its RNA splicing activity. We further show that TDP-43 mutations in the O-GlcNAcylation sites improve locomotion defects of larvae and adult flies and extend adult life spans, following TDP-43 overexpression in Drosophila motor neurons. We finally demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 promotes proper splicing of many mRNAs, including STMN2, which is required for normal axonal outgrowth and regeneration. Our findings suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might be a target for the treatment of TDP-43-linked pathogenesis.

33769671	Quaking (QKI) proteins belong to the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family of RNA-binding proteins that have multiple functions in RNA biology. Here, we show that QKI-5 is dramatically decreased in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). QKI-5 overexpression inhibits TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, whereas QKI-5 knockdown has the opposite effect. QKI-5 overexpression and silencing suppresses and promotes TGF-beta-stimulated metastasis in vivo, respectively. QKI-5 inhibits TGF-beta-induced EMT and invasion in a TGFbetaR1-dependent manner. KLF6 knockdown increases TGFbetaR1 expression and promotes TGF-beta-induced EMT, which is partly abrogated by QKI-5 overexpression. Mechanistically, QKI-5 directly interacts with the TGFbetaR1 3' UTR and causes post-transcriptional degradation of TGFbetaR1 mRNA, thereby inhibiting TGF-beta-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation and TGF-beta/SMAD signaling. QKI-5 is positively regulated by KLF6 at the transcriptional level. In LUAD tissues, KLF6 is lowly expressed and positively correlated with QKI-5 expression, while TGFbetaR1 expression is up-regulated and inversely correlated with QKI-5 expression. We reveal a novel mechanism by which KLF6 transcriptionally regulates QKI-5 and suggest that targeting the KLF6/QKI-5/TGFbetaR1 axis is a promising targeting strategy for metastatic LUAD.	Quaking 5 suppresses TGF-beta-induced EMT and cell invasion in lung adenocarcinoma.	EMBO reports
33987909	Lysosomal positioning and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling coordinate cellular responses to nutrient levels. Inadequate nutrient sensing can result in growth delays, a hallmark of Lowe syndrome. OCRL mutations cause Lowe syndrome, but the role of OCRL in nutrient sensing is unknown. Here, we show that OCRL is localized to the centrosome by its ASH domain and that it recruits microtubule-anchoring factor SSX2IP to the centrosome, which is important in the formation of the microtubule-organizing center. Deficiency of OCRL in human and mouse cells results in loss of microtubule-organizing centers and impaired microtubule-based lysosome movement, which in turn leads to mTORC1 inactivation and abnormal nutrient sensing. Centrosome-targeted PACT-SSX2IP can restore microtubule anchoring and mTOR activity. Importantly, boosting the activity of mTORC1 restores the nutrient sensing ability of Lowe patients' cells. Our findings highlight mTORC1 as a novel therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome.	OCRL regulates lysosome positioning and mTORC1 activity through SSX2IP-mediated microtubule anchoring.	EMBO reports
34056831	The recruitment of thermogenic brite adipocytes within white adipose tissue attenuates obesity and metabolic comorbidities, arousing interest in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The molecular network of brite adipogenesis, however, remains largely unresolved. In this light, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as a versatile class of modulators that control many steps within the differentiation machinery. Leveraging the naturally varying propensities of different inbred mouse strains for white adipose tissue browning, we identify the nuclear lncRNA Ctcflos as a pivotal orchestrator of thermogenic gene expression during brite adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Ctcflos acts as a pleiotropic regulator, being essential for the transcriptional recruitment of the early core thermogenic regulatory program and the modulation of alternative splicing to drive brite adipogenesis. This is showcased by Ctcflos-regulated gene transcription and splicing of the key browning factor Prdm16 toward the isoform that is specific for the thermogenic gene program. Conclusively, our findings emphasize the mechanistic versatility of lncRNAs acting at several independent levels of gene expression for effective regulation of key differentiation factors to direct cell fate and function.	LncRNA Ctcflos orchestrates transcription and alternative splicing in thermogenic adipogenesis.	EMBO reports
34080749	Progression through the cell cycle is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases that control gene expression, orchestration of mitotic spindle, and cell division. To identify new regulators of the cell cycle, we performed transcriptomic analysis of human non-transformed cells expressing a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator and identified 701 transcripts differentially expressed in G1 and G2 cells. Family with sequence similarity 110 member A (FAM110A) protein is highly expressed in G2 cells and localized at mitotic spindle and spindle poles during mitosis. Depletion of FAM110A impairs chromosomal alignment, delays metaphase-to-anaphase transition, and affects spindle positioning. Using mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation, we identified casein kinase I (CK1) in complex with FAM110A during mitosis. CK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of FAM110A in vitro, and inhibition of CK1 reduces phosphorylation of mitotic FAM110A. Wild-type FAM110A, but not the FAM110A-S252-S255A mutant deficient in CK1 phosphorylation, rescues the chromosomal alignment, duration of mitosis, and orientation of the mitotic spindle after depletion of endogenous FAM110A. We propose that CK1 regulates chromosomal alignment by phosphorylating FAM110A and promoting its interaction with mitotic spindle.	CK1-mediated phosphorylation of FAM110A promotes its interaction with mitotic spindle and controls chromosomal alignment.	EMBO reports
34114325	Dysregulation of lipid metabolism could lead to the development of metabolic disorders. We report here that the F-box protein JFK promotes excessive lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome. JFK transgenic mice develop spontaneous obesity, accompanied by dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, phenotypes that are further exacerbated under high-fat diets. In contrast, Jfk knockout mice are lean and resistant to diet-induced metabolic malfunctions. Liver-specific reconstitution of JFK expression in Jfk knockout mice leads to hepatic lipid accumulation resembling human hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We show that JFK interacts with and destabilizes ING5 through assembly of the SCF complex. Integrative transcriptomic and genomic analysis reveals that the SCF(JFK) -ING5 axis interferes with AMPK activity and fatty acid beta-oxidation, leading to the suppression of hepatic lipid catabolism. Significantly, JFK is upregulated and AMPKalpha1 is down-regulated in liver tissues from NAFLD patients. These results reveal that SCF(JFK) is a bona fide E3 ligase for ING5 and link the SCF(JFK) -ING5 axis to the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

34232566	Adipose tissue plays a major role in maintaining organismal metabolic equilibrium. Control over the fate decision from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to adipocyte differentiation involves coordinated command of phosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 2A plays an important role in Wnt pathway and adipocyte development, yet how PP2A complexes actively respond to adipocyte differentiation signals and acquire specificity in the face of the promiscuous activity of its catalytic subunit remains unknown. Here, we report the PP2A phosphatase B subunit B56alpha is specifically induced during adipocyte differentiation and mediates PP2A to dephosphorylate GSK3beta, thereby blocking Wnt activity and driving adipocyte differentiation. Using an inducible B56alpha knock-out mouse, we further demonstrate that B56alpha is essential for gonadal adipose tissue development in vivo and required for the fate decision of adipocytes over osteoblasts. Moreover, we show B56alpha expression is driven by the adipocyte transcription factor PPARgamma thereby establishing a novel link between PPARgamma signaling and Wnt blockade. Overall, our results reveal B56alpha is a necessary part of the machinery dictating the transition from pre-adipocyte to mature adipocyte and provide fundamental insights into how PP2A complex specifically and actively regulates unique signaling pathway in biology.	The B56alpha subunit of PP2A is necessary for mesenchymal stem cell commitment to adipocyte.	EMBO reports
34160127	The type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-alpha/beta)-mediated immune response is the first line of host defense against invading viruses. IFN-alpha/beta binds to IFN-alpha/beta receptors (IFNARs) and triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Thus, stabilization of IFNARs is important for prolonging antiviral activity. Here, we report the induction of an RNA-binding motif-containing protein, RBM47, upon viral infection or interferon stimulation. Using multiple virus infection models, we demonstrate that RBM47 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. RBM47 has no noticeable impact on IFN production, but significantly activates the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, RBM47 binds to the 3'UTR of IFNAR1 mRNA, increases mRNA stability, and retards the degradation of IFNAR1. In summary, this study suggests that RBM47 is an interferon-inducible RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in enhancing host IFN downstream signaling.	RNA-binding protein RBM47 stabilizes IFNAR1 mRNA to potentiate host antiviral activity.	EMBO reports
34347354	The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are implicated as the cause of a prevalent somatic mutation pattern found in cancer genomes. The APOBEC3 enzymes act as viral restriction factors by mutating viral genomes. Mutation of the cellular genome is presumed to be an off-target activity of the enzymes, although the regulatory measures for APOBEC3 expression and activity remain undefined. It is therefore difficult to predict circumstances that enable APOBEC3 interaction with cellular DNA that leads to mutagenesis. The APOBEC3A (A3A) enzyme is the most potent deaminase of the family. Using proteomics, we evaluate protein interactors of A3A to identify potential regulators. We find that A3A interacts with the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, a cellular machine that assists in protein folding and function. Importantly, depletion of CCT results in A3A-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Evaluation of cancer genomes demonstrates an enrichment of A3A mutational signatures in cancers with silencing mutations in CCT subunit genes. Together, these data suggest that the CCT complex interacts with A3A, and that disruption of CCT function results in increased A3A mutational activity.	Interaction with the CCT chaperonin complex limits APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase cytotoxicity.	EMBO reports
34296805	Melanoma cell phenotype switching between differentiated melanocytic and undifferentiated mesenchymal-like states drives metastasis and drug resistance. CDK7 is the serine/threonine kinase of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. We show that dedifferentiation of melanocytic-type melanoma cells into mesenchymal-like cells and acquisition of tolerance to targeted therapies is achieved through chronic inhibition of CDK7. In addition to emergence of a mesenchymal-type signature, we identify a GATA6-dependent gene expression program comprising genes such as AMIGO2 or ABCG2 involved in melanoma survival or targeted drug tolerance, respectively. Mechanistically, we show that CDK7 drives expression of the melanocyte lineage transcription factor MITF that in turn binds to an intronic region of GATA6 to repress its expression in melanocytic-type cells. We show that GATA6 expression is activated in MITF-low melanoma cells of patient-derived xenografts. Taken together, our data show how the poorly characterized repressive function of MITF in melanoma participates in a molecular cascade regulating activation of a transcriptional program involved in survival and drug resistance in melanoma.	CDK7 and MITF repress a transcription program involved in survival and drug tolerance in melanoma.	EMBO reports
34309175	Differentiated cells across multiple species and organs can re-enter the cell cycle to aid in injury-induced tissue regeneration by a cellular program called paligenosis. Here, we show that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is induced early during paligenosis in multiple cellular contexts, transcriptionally activating the lysosomal trafficking gene Rab7b. ATF3 and RAB7B are upregulated in gastric and pancreatic digestive-enzyme-secreting cells at the onset of paligenosis Stage 1, when cells massively induce autophagic and lysosomal machinery to dismantle differentiated cell morphological features. Their expression later ebbs before cells enter mitosis during Stage 3. Atf3(-/-) mice fail to induce RAB7-positive autophagic and lysosomal vesicles, eventually causing increased death of cells en route to Stage 3. Finally, we observe that ATF3 is expressed in human gastric metaplasia and during paligenotic injury across multiple other organs and species. Thus, our findings indicate ATF3 is an evolutionarily conserved gene orchestrating the early paligenotic autodegradative events that must occur before cells are poised to proliferate and contribute to tissue repair.	ATF3 induces RAB7 to govern autodegradation in paligenosis, a conserved cell plasticity program.	EMBO reports
34358402	Our knowledge of the coordination of fuel usage in skeletal muscle is incomplete. Whether and how microRNAs are involved in the substrate selection for oxidation is largely unknown. Here we show that mice lacking miR-183 and miR-96 have enhanced muscle oxidative phenotype and altered glucose/lipid homeostasis. Moreover, loss of miR-183 and miR-96 results in a shift in substrate utilization toward fat relative to carbohydrates in mice. Mechanistically, loss of miR-183 and miR-96 suppresses glucose utilization in skeletal muscle by increasing PDHA1 phosphorylation via targeting FoxO1 and PDK4. On the other hand, loss of miR-183 and miR-96 promotes fat usage in skeletal muscle by enhancing intramuscular lipolysis via targeting FoxO1 and ATGL. Thus, our study establishes miR-183 and miR-96 as master coordinators of fuel selection and metabolic homeostasis owing to their capability of modulating both glucose utilization and fat catabolism. Lastly, we show that loss of miR-183 and miR-96 can alleviate obesity and improve glucose metabolism in high-fat diet-induced mice, suggesting that miR-183 and miR-96 may serve as therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.	miR-183 and miR-96 orchestrate both glucose and fat utilization in skeletal muscle.

34382737	The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CDC20-activated anaphase-promoting complex/Cyclosome (APC/C(CDC20) ) plays a critical role in governing mitotic progression by targeting key cell cycle regulators for degradation. Cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (CDC20), the co-activator of APC/C, is required for full ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition to its well-known cell cycle-related functions, we demonstrate that CDC20 plays an essential role in osteogenic commitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMSCs). Cdc20 conditional knockout mice exhibit decreased bone formation and impaired bone regeneration after injury. Mechanistically, we discovered a functional interaction between the WD40 domain of CDC20 and the DNA-binding domain of p65. Moreover, CDC20 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p65 in an APC11-dependent manner. More importantly, knockdown of p65 rescues the bone loss in Cdc20 conditional knockout mice. Our current work reveals a cell cycle-independent function of CDC20, establishes APC11(CDC20) as a pivotal regulator for bone formation by governing the ubiquitination and degradation of p65, and may pave the way for treatment of bone-related diseases.	CDC20 promotes bone formation via APC/C dependent ubiquitination and degradation of p65.	EMBO reports
34369648	ATG9A, the only multi-pass transmembrane protein among core ATG proteins, is an essential regulator of autophagy, yet its regulatory mechanisms and network of interactions are poorly understood. Through quantitative BioID proteomics, we identify a network of ATG9A interactions that includes members of the ULK1 complex and regulators of membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking, including the TRAPP, EARP, GARP, exocyst, AP-1, and AP-4 complexes. These interactions mark pathways of ATG9A trafficking through ER, Golgi, and endosomal systems. In exploring these data, we find that ATG9A interacts with components of the ULK1 complex, particularly ATG13 and ATG101. Using knockout/reconstitution and split-mVenus approaches to capture the ATG13-ATG101 dimer, we find that ATG9A interacts with ATG13-ATG101 independently of ULK1. Deletion of ATG13 or ATG101 causes a shift in ATG9A distribution, resulting in an aberrant accumulation of ATG9A at stalled clusters of p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitin, which can be rescued by an ULK1 binding-deficient mutant of ATG13. Together, these data reveal ATG9A interactions in vesicle-trafficking and autophagy pathways, including a role for an ULK1-independent ATG13 complex in regulating ATG9A.

34402578	Cytokinins are phytohormones that regulate plant development, growth, and responses to stress. In particular, cytokinin has been reported to negatively regulate plant adaptation to high salinity; however, the molecular mechanisms that counteract cytokinin signaling and enable salt tolerance are not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that salt stress induces the degradation of the cytokinin signaling components Arabidopsis (Arabidopisis thaliana) response regulator 1 (ARR1), ARR10 and ARR12. Furthermore, the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MPK3) and MPK6 interact with and phosphorylate ARR1/10/12 to promote their degradation in response to salt stress. As expected, salt tolerance is decreased in the mpk3/6 double mutant, but enhanced upon ectopic MPK3/MPK6 activation in an MKK5(DD) line. Importantly, salt hypersensitivity phenotypes of the mpk3/6 line were significantly alleviated by mutation of ARR1/12. The above results indicate that MPK3/6 enhance salt tolerance in part via their negative regulation of ARR1/10/12 protein stability. Thus, our work reveals a new molecular mechanism underlying salt-induced stress adaptation and the inhibition of plant growth, via enhanced degradation of cytokinin signaling components.	MPK3/6-induced degradation of ARR1/10/12 promotes salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.	EMBO reports
34459531	Cholesterol is essential for membrane biogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The role of cholesterol in cancer development and the regulation of cholesterol synthesis are still under active investigation. Here we show that under normal-sterol conditions, p53 directly represses the expression of SQLE, a rate-limiting and the first oxygenation enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, in a SREBP2-independent manner. Through transcriptional downregulation of SQLE, p53 represses cholesterol production in vivo and in vitro, leading to tumor growth suppression. Inhibition of SQLE using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or terbinafine (a SQLE inhibitor) reverses the increased cell proliferation caused by p53 deficiency. Conversely, SQLE overexpression or cholesterol addition promotes cell proliferation, particularly in p53 wild-type cells. More importantly, pharmacological inhibition or shRNA-mediated silencing of SQLE restricts nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-induced liver tumorigenesis in p53 knockout mice. Therefore, our findings reveal a role for p53 in regulating SQLE and cholesterol biosynthesis, and further demonstrate that downregulation of SQLE is critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression.	p53 transcriptionally regulates SQLE to repress cholesterol synthesis and tumor growth.

32989251	Alveolar epithelial regeneration is essential for recovery from devastating lung diseases. This process occurs when type II alveolar pneumocytes (AT2 cells) proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar pneumocytes (AT1 cells). We used genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression following acute lung injury to elucidate repair mechanisms. AT2 chromatin accessibility changed substantially following injury to reveal STAT3 binding motifs adjacent to genes that regulate essential regenerative pathways. Single-cell transcriptome analysis identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) as a STAT3 target gene with newly accessible chromatin in a unique population of regenerating AT2 cells. Furthermore, the BDNF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) was enriched on mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs). Loss or blockade of AT2-specific Stat3, Bdnf or mesenchyme-specific TrkB compromised repair and reduced Fgf7 expression by niche cells. A TrkB agonist improved outcomes in vivo following lung injury. These data highlight the biological and therapeutic importance of the STAT3-BDNF-TrkB axis in orchestrating alveolar epithelial regeneration.

32895492	Cooperation between DNA, RNA and protein regulates gene expression and controls differentiation through interactions that connect regions of nucleic acids and protein domains and through the assembly of biomolecular condensates. Here, we report that endoderm differentiation is regulated by the interaction between the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DIGIT and the bromodomain and extraterminal domain protein BRD3. BRD3 forms phase-separated condensates of which the formation is promoted by DIGIT, occupies enhancers of endoderm transcription factors and is required for endoderm differentiation. BRD3 binds to histone H3 acetylated at lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in vitro and co-occupies the genome with H3K18ac. DIGIT is also enriched in regions of H3K18ac, and the depletion of DIGIT results in decreased recruitment of BRD3 to these regions. Our findings show that cooperation between DIGIT and BRD3 at regions of H3K18ac regulates the transcription factors that drive endoderm differentiation and suggest that protein-lncRNA phase-separated condensates have a broader role as regulators of transcription.	lncRNA DIGIT and BRD3 protein form phase-separated condensates to regulate endoderm differentiation.

32929201	Although pyroptosis is critical for macrophages against pathogen infection, its role and mechanism in cancer cells remains unclear. PD-L1 has been detected in the nucleus, with unknown function. Here we show that PD-L1 switches TNFalpha-induced apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells, resulting in tumour necrosis. Under hypoxia, p-Stat3 physically interacts with PD-L1 and facilitates its nuclear translocation, enhancing the transcription of the gasdermin C (GSDMC) gene. GSDMC is specifically cleaved by caspase-8 with TNFalpha treatment, generating a GSDMC N-terminal domain that forms pores on the cell membrane and induces pyroptosis. Nuclear PD-L1, caspase-8 and GSDMC are required for macrophage-derived TNFalpha-induced tumour necrosis in vivo. Moreover, high expression of GSDMC correlates with poor survival. Antibiotic chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis in breast cancer. These findings identify a non-immune checkpoint function of PD-L1 and provide an unexpected concept that GSDMC/caspase-8 mediates a non-canonical pyroptosis pathway in cancer cells, causing tumour necrosis.	PD-L1-mediated gasdermin C expression switches apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells and facilitates tumour necrosis.	Nature cell biology
33005030	Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a devastating disease. Radiation therapy remains the mainstay for treatment of this disease. Unfortunately, its efficacy is limited by the dose that can be safely applied. One promising approach to overcoming this limitation is to sensitize BCBMs to radiation by inhibiting their ability to repair DNA damage. Here, we report a DNA repair suppressor, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 31 (LRRC31), that was identified through a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We found that overexpression of LRRC31 suppresses DNA repair and sensitizes BCBMs to radiation. Mechanistically, LRRC31 interacts with Ku70/Ku80 and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at the protein level, resulting in inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) recruitment and activation, and disruption of the MutS homologue 2 (MSH2)-ATR module. We demonstrate that targeted delivery of the LRRC31 gene via nanoparticles improves the survival of tumour-bearing mice after irradiation. Collectively, our study suggests LRRC31 as a major DNA repair suppressor that can be targeted for cancer radiosensitizing therapy.	LRRC31 inhibits DNA repair and sensitizes breast cancer brain metastasis to radiation therapy.	Nature cell biology
33106653	Dystrophin proteomic regulation in muscular dystrophies (MDs) remains unclear. We report that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), H19, associates with dystrophin and inhibits E3-ligase-dependent polyubiquitination at Lys 3584 (referred to as Ub-DMD) and its subsequent protein degradation. In-frame deletions in BMD and a DMD non-silent mutation (C3340Y) resulted in defects in the ability of the protein to interact with H19, which caused elevated Ub-DMD levels and dystrophin degradation. Dmd C3333Y mice exhibited progressive MD, elevated serum creatine kinase, heart dilation, blood vessel irregularity and respiratory failure with concurrently reduced dystrophin and increased Ub-DMD status. H19 RNA oligonucleotides conjugated with agrin (AGR-H19) and nifenazone competed with or inhibited TRIM63. Dmd C3333Y animals, induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived skeletal muscle cells from patients with Becker MD and mdx mice subjected to exon skipping exhibited inhibited dystrophin degradation, preserved skeletal and cardiac muscle histology, and improved strength and heart function following AGR-H19 or nifenazone treatment. Our study paves the way for meaningful targeted therapeutics for Becker MD and for certain patients with Duchenne MD.	The lncRNA H19 alleviates muscular dystrophy by stabilizing dystrophin.

33046882	Cardiomyocyte loss after injury results in adverse remodelling and fibrosis, inevitably leading to heart failure. The ERBB2-Neuregulin and Hippo-YAP signalling pathways are key mediators of heart regeneration, yet the crosstalk between them is unclear. We demonstrate that transient overexpression of activated ERBB2 in cardiomyocytes (OE CMs) promotes cardiac regeneration in a heart failure model. OE CMs present an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like regenerative response manifested by cytoskeletal remodelling, junction dissolution, migration and extracellular matrix turnover. We identified YAP as a critical mediator of ERBB2 signalling. In OE CMs, YAP interacts with nuclear-envelope and cytoskeletal components, reflecting an altered mechanical state elicited by ERBB2. We identified two YAP-activating phosphorylations on S352 and S274 in OE CMs, which peak during metaphase, that are ERK dependent and Hippo independent. Viral overexpression of YAP phospho-mutants dampened the proliferative competence of OE CMs. Together, we reveal a potent ERBB2-mediated YAP mechanotransduction signalling, involving EMT-like characteristics, resulting in robust heart regeneration.

33139939	The canonical model of agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signalling proposes that PI3K is activated at the plasma membrane, where receptors are activated and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate is concentrated. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate generation and activated Akt are instead largely confined to intracellular membranes upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) interacts with and controls localization of membrane vesicle-associated PI3Kalpha to microtubules. The microtubule-binding domain of MAP4 binds directly to the C2 domain of the p110alpha catalytic subunit. MAP4 controls the interaction of PI3Kalpha with activated receptors at endosomal compartments along microtubules. Loss of MAP4 results in the loss of PI3Kalpha targeting and loss of PI3K-Akt signalling downstream of multiple agonists. The MAP4-PI3Kalpha assembly defines a mechanism for spatial control of agonist-stimulated PI3K-Akt signalling at internal membrane compartments linked to the microtubule network.	Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase signalling is spatially organized at endosomal compartments by microtubule-associated protein 4.	Nature cell biology
33199845	The Hippo pathway plays critical roles in cell growth, differentiation, organ development and tissue homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation can lead to tumorigenesis. YAP and TAZ are transcription co-activators and represent the main downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Here, we show that heat stress induces a strong and rapid YAP dephosphorylation and activation. The effect of heat shock on YAP is dominant to other signals known to modulate the Hippo pathway. Heat shock inhibits LATS kinase by promoting HSP90-dependent LATS interaction with and inactivation by protein phosphatase 5. Heat shock also induces LATS ubiquitination and degradation. YAP and TAZ are crucial for cellular heat shock responses, including the heat shock transcriptome and cell viability. This study uncovers previously unknown mechanisms of Hippo regulation by heat shock, as well as physiological functions of YAP, in the heat stress response. Our observations also reveal a potential combinational therapy involving hyperthermia and targeting of the Hippo pathway.	Heat stress activates YAP/TAZ to induce the heat shock transcriptome.

33420490	Nutrient availability is central for T-cell functions and immune responses. Here we report that CD8(+) T-cell activation and anti-tumour responses are strongly potentiated by the non-essential amino acid Asn. Increased Asn levels enhance CD8(+) T-cell activation and effector functions against tumour cells in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, restriction of dietary Asn, ASNase administration or inhibition of the Asn transporter SLC1A5 impairs the activity and responses of CD8(+) T cells. Mechanistically, Asn does not directly alter cellular metabolic fluxes; it instead binds the SRC-family protein tyrosine kinase LCK and orchestrates LCK phosphorylation at Tyr 394 and 505, thereby leading to enhanced LCK activity and T-cell-receptor signalling. Thus, our findings reveal a critical and metabolism-independent role for Asn in the direct modulation of the adaptive immune response by controlling T-cell activation and efficacy, and further uncover that LCK is a natural Asn sensor signalling Asn sufficiency to T-cell functions.	Asparagine enhances LCK signalling to potentiate CD8(+) T-cell activation and anti-tumour responses.	Nature cell biology
33558728	In patients with advanced-stage cancer, cancer-associated anorexia affects treatment success and patient survival. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Dilp8, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian insulin-like 3 peptide (INSL3), is secreted from tumour tissues and induces anorexia through the Lgr3 receptor in the brain. Activated Dilp8-Lgr3 signalling upregulated anorexigenic nucleobinding 1 (NUCB1) and downregulated orexigenic short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF expression in the brain. In the cancer condition, the protein expression of Lgr3 and NUCB1 was significantly upregulated in neurons expressing sNPF and NPF. INSL3 levels were increased in tumour-implanted mice and INSL3-treated mouse hypothalamic cells showed Nucb2 upregulation and Npy downregulation. Food consumption was significantly reduced in intracerebrospinal INSL3-injected mice. In patients with pancreatic cancer, higher serum INSL3 levels increased anorexia. These results indicate that tumour-derived Dilp8/INSL3 induces cancer anorexia by regulating feeding hormones through the Lgr3/Lgr8 receptor in Drosophila and mammals.	Tumour-derived Dilp8/INSL3 induces cancer anorexia by regulating feeding neuropeptides via Lgr3/8 in the brain.	Nature cell biology
33723425	The complexity of intracellular signalling requires both a diversity of molecular players and the sequestration of activity to unique compartments within the cell. Recent findings on the role of liquid-liquid phase separation provide a distinct mechanism for the spatial segregation of proteins to regulate signalling pathway crosstalk. Here, we discover that DACT1 is induced by TGFbeta and forms protein condensates in the cytoplasm to repress Wnt signalling. These condensates do not localize to any known organelles but, rather, exist as phase-separated proteinaceous cytoplasmic bodies. The deletion of intrinsically disordered domains within the DACT1 protein eliminates its ability to both form protein condensates and suppress Wnt signalling. Isolation and mass spectrometry analysis of these particles revealed a complex of protein machinery that sequesters casein kinase 2-a Wnt pathway activator. We further demonstrate that DACT1 condensates are maintained in vivo and that DACT1 is critical to breast and prostate cancer bone metastasis.	TGF-beta-induced DACT1 biomolecular condensates repress Wnt signalling to promote bone metastasis.	Nature cell biology
33664495	The sympathetic nervous system-catecholamine-uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) axis plays an essential role in non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis. However, whether there exists a direct effector that physically connects catecholamine signalling to UCP1 in response to acute cold is unknown. Here we report that outer mitochondrial membrane-located AIDA is phosphorylated at S161 by the catecholamine-activated protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylated AIDA translocates to the intermembrane space, where it binds to and activates the uncoupling activity of UCP1 by promoting cysteine oxidation of UCP1. Adipocyte-specific depletion of AIDA abrogates UCP1-dependent thermogenesis, resulting in hypothermia during acute cold exposure. Re-expression of S161A-AIDA, unlike wild-type AIDA, fails to restore the acute cold response in Aida-knockout mice. The PKA-AIDA-UCP1 axis is highly conserved in mammals, including hibernators. Denervation of the sympathetic postganglionic fibres abolishes cold-induced AIDA-dependent thermogenesis. These findings uncover a direct mechanistic link between sympathetic input and UCP1-mediated adaptive thermogenesis.	AIDA directly connects sympathetic innervation to adaptive thermogenesis by UCP1.

33664496	Activated EGFR signalling drives tumorigenicity in 50% of glioblastoma (GBM). However, EGFR-targeting therapy has proven ineffective in treating patients with GBM, indicating that there is redundant EGFR activation. Circular RNAs are covalently closed RNA transcripts that are involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Herein, we report an additional activation mechanism of EGFR signalling in GBM by an undescribed secretory E-cadherin protein variant (C-E-Cad) encoded by a circular E-cadherin (circ-E-Cad) RNA through multiple-round open reading frame translation. C-E-Cad is overexpressed in GBM and promotes glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. C-E-Cad activates EGFR independent of EGF through association with the EGFR CR2 domain using a unique 14-amino-acid carboxy terminus, thereby maintaining glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. Notably, inhibition of C-E-Cad markedly enhances the antitumour activity of therapeutic anti-EGFR strategies in GBM. Our results uncover a critical role of C-E-Cad in stimulating EGFR signalling and provide a promising approach for treating EGFR-driven GBM.	Circular RNA-encoded oncogenic E-cadherin variant promotes glioblastoma tumorigenicity through activation of EGFR-STAT3 signalling.	Nature cell biology
33795875	Dysregulated translation is a common feature of cancer. Uncovering its governing factors and underlying mechanism are important for cancer therapy. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), previously known as a transcription repressor and lysine methyltransferase, can directly interact with fibrillarin (FBL) to exert its role in translational regulation. We demonstrate that EZH2 enhances rRNA 2'-O methylation via its direct interaction with FBL. Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the FBL-NOP56 interaction and facilitates the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Strikingly, EZH2 deficiency impairs the translation process globally and reduces internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation in cancer cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of EZH2 in cancer-related translational regulation.

33795871	Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt their metabolism to enable the growth of new blood vessels, but little is known how ECs regulate metabolism to adopt a quiescent state. Here, we show that the metabolite S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG) plays a crucial role in the regulation of endothelial quiescence. We find that S-2HG is produced in ECs after activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), where it limits cell cycle progression, metabolic activity and vascular expansion. FOXO1 stimulates S-2HG production by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition relies on branched-chain amino acid catabolites such as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, which increase in ECs with activated FOXO1. Treatment of ECs with 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate elicits S-2HG production and suppresses proliferation, causing vascular rarefaction in mice. Our findings identify a metabolic programme that promotes the acquisition of a quiescent endothelial state and highlight the role of metabolites as signalling molecules in the endothelium.

34108663	Cells employ transcription-coupled repair (TCR) to eliminate transcription-blocking DNA lesions. DNA damage-induced binding of the TCR-specific repair factor CSB to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) triggers RNAPII ubiquitylation of a single lysine (K1268) by the CRL4(CSA) ubiquitin ligase. How CRL4(CSA) is specifically directed towards K1268 is unknown. Here, we identify ELOF1 as the missing link that facilitates RNAPII ubiquitylation, a key signal for the assembly of downstream repair factors. This function requires its constitutive interaction with RNAPII close to K1268, revealing ELOF1 as a specificity factor that binds and positions CRL4(CSA) for optimal RNAPII ubiquitylation. Drug-genetic interaction screening also revealed a CSB-independent pathway in which ELOF1 prevents R-loops in active genes and protects cells against DNA replication stress. Our study offers key insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCR and provides a genetic framework of the interplay between transcriptional stress responses and DNA replication.	ELOF1 is a transcription-coupled DNA repair factor that directs RNA polymerase II ubiquitylation.	Nature cell biology
34226698	The YAP/TAZ transcriptional programme is not only a well-established driver of cancer progression and metastasis but also an important stimulator of tissue regeneration. Here we identified Cerebral cavernous malformations 3 (CCM3) as a regulator of mechanical cue-driven YAP/TAZ signalling, controlling both tumour progression and stem cell differentiation. We demonstrate that CCM3 localizes to focal adhesion sites in cancer-associated fibroblasts, where it regulates mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. Mechanistically, CCM3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mutually compete for binding to paxillin to fine-tune FAK/Src/paxillin-driven mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. In mouse models of breast cancer, specific loss of CCM3 in cancer-associated fibroblasts leads to exacerbated tissue remodelling and force transmission to the matrix, resulting in reciprocal YAP/TAZ activation in the neighbouring tumour cells and dissemination of metastasis to distant organs. Similarly, CCM3 regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. In conclusion, CCM3 is a gatekeeper in focal adhesions that controls mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ signalling.

34239062	Inflammatory bowel diseases present with elevated levels of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death, which compromises the gut barrier, activating immune cells and triggering more IEC death. The endogenous signals that prevent IEC death and break this vicious cycle, allowing resolution of intestinal inflammation, remain largely unknown. Here we show that prostaglandin E2 signalling via the E-type prostanoid receptor 4 (EP4) on IECs represses epithelial necroptosis and induces resolution of colitis. We found that EP4 expression correlates with an improved IBD outcome and that EP4 activation induces a transcriptional signature consistent with resolution of intestinal inflammation. We further show that dysregulated necroptosis prevents resolution, and EP4 agonism suppresses necroptosis in human and mouse IECs. Mechanistically, EP4 signalling on IECs converges on receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 to suppress tumour necrosis factor-induced activation and membrane translocation of the necroptosis effector mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase. In summary, our study indicates that EP4 promotes the resolution of colitis by suppressing IEC necroptosis.

34354233	The shieldin complex functions as the downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 to promote DNA double-strand break end-joining by restricting end resection. The SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA ends and blocks end resection through OB-fold domains. Besides blocking end resection, it is unclear how the shieldin complex processes SHLD2-bound single-stranded DNA and promotes non-homologous end-joining. Here, we identify a downstream effector of the shieldin complex, ASTE1, as a structure-specific DNA endonuclease that specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA and 3' overhang DNA. ASTE1 localizes to DNA damage sites in a shieldin-dependent manner. Loss of ASTE1 impairs non-homologous end-joining, leads to hyper-resection and causes defective immunoglobulin class switch recombination. ASTE1 deficiency also causes resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cells owing to restoration of homologous recombination. These findings suggest that ASTE1-mediated 3' single-stranded DNA end cleavage contributes to the control of DSB repair choice by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin.	ASTE1 promotes shieldin-complex-mediated DNA repair by attenuating end resection.	Nature cell biology
34497368	The extracellular-signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (hereafter ERK1/2) represent the foremost mitogenic pathway in mammalian cells, and their dysregulation drives tumorigenesis and confers therapeutic resistance. ERK1/2 are known to be activated by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-mediated phosphorylation. Here, we show that ERK1/2 are also modified by lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains. We identify the tripartite motif-containing protein TRIM15 as a ubiquitin ligase and the tumour suppressor CYLD as a deubiquitinase of ERK1/2. TRIM15 and CYLD regulate ERK ubiquitination at defined lysine residues through mutually exclusive interactions as well as opposing activities. K63-linked polyubiquitination enhances ERK interaction with and activation by MEK. Downregulation of TRIM15 inhibits the growth of both drug-responsive and drug-resistant melanomas. Moreover, high TRIM15 expression and low CYLD expression are associated with poor prognosis of patients with melanoma. These findings define a role of K63-linked polyubiquitination in the ERK signalling pathway and suggest a potential target for cancer therapy.	TRIM15 and CYLD regulate ERK activation via lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination.	Nature cell biology
32857952	(p)ppGpp is a nucleotide messenger universally produced in bacteria following nutrient starvation. In E. coli, ppGpp inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis by targeting several different enzymes, but the physiological significance of their inhibition is unknown. Here, we report the structural basis of inhibition for one target, Gsk, the inosine-guanosine kinase. Gsk creates an unprecedented, allosteric binding pocket for ppGpp by restructuring terminal sequences, which restrains conformational dynamics necessary for catalysis. Guided by this structure, we generated a chromosomal mutation that abolishes Gsk regulation by ppGpp. This mutant strain accumulates abnormally high levels of purine nucleotides following amino-acid starvation, compromising cellular fitness. We demonstrate that this unrestricted increase in purine nucleotides is detrimental because it severely depletes pRpp and essential, pRpp-derived metabolites, including UTP, histidine, and tryptophan. Thus, our results reveal the significance of ppGpp's regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and a critical mechanism by which E. coli coordinates biosynthetic processes during starvation.	ppGpp Coordinates Nucleotide and Amino-Acid Synthesis in E. coli During Starvation.

32937100	Immune cell function depends on specific metabolic programs dictated by mitochondria, including nutrient oxidation, macromolecule synthesis, and post-translational modifications. Mitochondrial adaptations have been linked to acute and chronic inflammation, but the metabolic cues and precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here we reveal that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is essential for shaping mitochondrial adaptations for IL-1beta production in macrophages through non-histone deacetylation. In vivo, HDAC3 promoted lipopolysaccharide-induced acute inflammation and high-fat diet-induced chronic inflammation by enhancing NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation. HDAC3 configured the lipid profile in stimulated macrophages and restricted fatty acid oxidation (FAO) supported by exogenous fatty acids for mitochondria to acquire their adaptations and depolarization. Rather than affecting nuclear gene expression, HDAC3 translocated to mitochondria to deacetylate and inactivate an FAO enzyme, mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha. HDAC3 may serve as a controlling node that balances between acquiring mitochondrial adaptations and sustaining their fitness for IL-1beta-dependent inflammation.

33022274	Cancer metastasis accounts for the major cause of cancer-related deaths. How disseminated cancer cells cope with hostile microenvironments in secondary site for full-blown metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we show that AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), activated in mouse metastasis models, drives pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activation to maintain TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and promotes cancer metastasis by adapting cancer cells to metabolic and oxidative stresses. This AMPK-PDHc axis is activated in advanced breast cancer and predicts poor metastasis-free survival. Mechanistically, AMPK localizes in the mitochondrial matrix and phosphorylates the catalytic alpha subunit of PDHc (PDHA) on two residues S295 and S314, which activates the enzymatic activity of PDHc and alleviates an inhibitory phosphorylation by PDHKs, respectively. Importantly, these phosphorylation events mediate PDHc function in cancer metastasis. Our study reveals that AMPK-mediated PDHA phosphorylation drives PDHc activation and TCA cycle to empower cancer cells adaptation to metastatic microenvironments for metastasis.

32979304	Necroptosis induction in vitro often requires caspase-8 (Casp8) inhibition by zVAD because pro-Casp8 cleaves RIP1 to disintegrate the necrosome. It has been unclear how the Casp8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. Here, we show that pro-Casp8 within the necrosome can be inactivated by phosphorylation at Thr265 (pC8(T265)). pC8(T265) occurs in vitro in various necroptotic cells and in the cecum of TNF-treated mice. p90 RSK is the kinase of pro-Casp8. It is activated by a mechanism that does not need ERK but PDK1, which is recruited to the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL-containing necrosome. Phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 can substitute for zVAD to permit necroptosis in vitro. pC8(T265) mimic T265E knockin mice are embryonic lethal due to unconstrained necroptosis, and the pharmaceutical inhibition of RSK-mediated pC8(T265) diminishes TNF-induced cecum damage and lethality in mice by halting necroptosis. Thus, phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 by RSK is an intrinsic mechanism for passing the Casp8 checkpoint of necroptosis.

32966758	Stabilization of stalled replication forks is a prominent mechanism of PARP (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase) inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA-deficient tumors. Epigenetic mechanisms of replication fork stability are emerging but remain poorly understood. Here, we report the histone acetyltransferase PCAF (p300/CBP-associated) as a fork-associated protein that promotes fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells by acetylating H4K8 at stalled replication forks, which recruits MRE11 and EXO1. A H4K8ac binding domain within MRE11/EXO1 is required for their recruitment to stalled forks. Low PCAF levels, which we identify in a subset of BRCA2-deficient tumors, stabilize stalled forks, resulting in PARPi resistance in BRCA-deficient cells. Furthermore, PCAF activity is tightly regulated by ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which phosphorylates PCAF on serine 264 (S264) to limit its association and activity at stalled forks. Our results reveal PCAF and histone acetylation as critical regulators of fork stability and PARPi responses in BRCA-deficient cells, which provides key insights into targeting BRCA-deficient tumors and identifying epigenetic modulators of chemotherapeutic responses.

32966759	Efficient release of promoter-proximally paused RNA Pol II into productive elongation is essential for gene expression. Recently, we reported that the Integrator complex can bind paused RNA Pol II and drive premature transcription termination, potently attenuating the activity of target genes. Premature termination requires RNA cleavage by the endonuclease subunit of Integrator, but the roles of other Integrator subunits in gene regulation have yet to be elucidated. Here we report that Integrator subunit 8 (IntS8) is critical for transcription repression and required for association with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We find that Integrator-bound PP2A dephosphorylates the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain and Spt5, preventing the transition to productive elongation. Thus, blocking PP2A association with Integrator stimulates pause release and gene activity. These results reveal a second catalytic function associated with Integrator-mediated transcription termination and indicate that control of productive elongation involves active competition between transcriptional kinases and phosphatases.

33108758	While effective anti-cancer drugs targeting the CHK1 kinase are advancing in the clinic, drug resistance is rapidly emerging. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated knockout of the little-known gene FAM122A/PABIR1 confers cellular resistance to CHK1 inhibitors (CHK1is) and cross-resistance to ATR inhibitors. Knockout of FAM122A results in activation of PP2A-B55alpha, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the WEE1 protein and rescues WEE1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The resulting increase in WEE1 protein expression reduces replication stress, activates the G2/M checkpoint, and confers cellular resistance to CHK1is. Interestingly, in tumor cells with oncogene-driven replication stress, CHK1 can directly phosphorylate FAM122A, leading to activation of the PP2A-B55alpha phosphatase and increased WEE1 expression. A combination of a CHK1i plus a WEE1 inhibitor can overcome CHK1i resistance of these tumor cells, thereby enhancing anti-cancer activity. The FAM122A expression level in a tumor cell can serve as a useful biomarker for predicting CHK1i sensitivity or resistance.

33022275	The ubiquitin system regulates the DNA damage response (DDR) by modifying histone H2A at Lys15 (H2AK15ub) and triggering downstream signaling events. Here, we find that phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 (pUbT12) controls the DDR by inhibiting the function of 53BP1, a key factor for DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Detectable as a chromatin modification on H2AK15ub, pUbT12 accumulates in nuclear foci and is increased upon DNA damage. Mutating Thr12 prevents the removal of ubiquitin from H2AK15ub by USP51 deubiquitinating enzyme, leading to a pronounced accumulation of ubiquitinated chromatin. Chromatin modified by pUbT12 is inaccessible to 53BP1 but permissive to the homologous recombination (HR) proteins RNF169, RAD51, and the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. Phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 in the chromatin context is a new histone mark, H2AK15pUbT12, that regulates the DDR by hampering the activity of 53BP1 at damaged chromosomes.

33157014	Amino-acid-induced lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) localization through the Rag GTPases is a critical step for its activation by Rheb GTPase. However, how the mTORC1 interacts with Rheb on the lysosome remains elusive. We report that amino acids enhance the polyubiquitination of Rheb (Ub-Rheb), which shows a strong binding preference for mTORC1 and supports its activation, while the Ub-Rheb is subjected to subsequent degradation. Mechanistically, we identified ATXN3 as a Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal localization is blocked by active Rag heterodimer in response to amino acid stimulation. Consistently, cells lacking functional Rag heterodimer on the lysosome accumulate Ub-Rheb, and blockade of its degradation instigates robust lysosomal mTORC1 localization and its activation without the Ragulator-Rag system. Thus, polyubiquitination of Rheb is an important post-translational modification, which facilitates the binding of mTORC1 to Rheb on the lysosome and is another crosstalk between the amino acid and growth factor signaling for mTORC1 activation.

33157015	Although TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, the p53-dependent transcriptional programs mediating tumor suppression remain incompletely understood. Here, to uncover critical components downstream of p53 in tumor suppression, we perform unbiased RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens in vivo. These screens converge upon the p53-inducible gene Zmat3, encoding an RNA-binding protein, and we demonstrate that ZMAT3 is an important tumor suppressor downstream of p53 in mouse Kras(G12D)-driven lung and liver cancers and human carcinomas. Integrative analysis of the ZMAT3 RNA-binding landscape and transcriptomic profiling reveals that ZMAT3 directly modulates exon inclusion in transcripts encoding proteins of diverse functions, including the p53 inhibitors MDM4 and MDM2, splicing regulators, and components of varied cellular processes. Interestingly, these exons are enriched in NMD signals, and, accordingly, ZMAT3 broadly affects target transcript stability. Collectively, these studies reveal ZMAT3 as a novel RNA-splicing and homeostasis regulator and a key component of p53-mediated tumor suppression.

33171122	Extracellular 2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels, better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely expressed cGAMP transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2'3'-cyclic dinucleotides. In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine 1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when activated.	LRRC8A:C/E Heteromeric Channels Are Ubiquitous Transporters of cGAMP.	Molecular cell
33113344	Aberrant mitophagy has been implicated in a broad spectrum of disorders. PINK1, Parkin, and ubiquitin have pivotal roles in priming mitophagy. However, the entire regulatory landscape and the precise control mechanisms of mitophagy remain to be elucidated. Here, we uncover fundamental mitophagy regulation involving PINK1 and a non-canonical role of the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFm). The mitochondrion-cytosol dual-localized TUFm interacts with PINK1 biochemically and genetically, which is an evolutionarily conserved Parkin-independent route toward mitophagy. A PINK1-dependent TUFm phosphoswitch at Ser222 determines conversion from activating to suppressing mitophagy. PINK1 modulates differential translocation of TUFm because p-S222-TUFm is restricted predominantly to the cytosol, where it inhibits mitophagy by impeding Atg5-Atg12 formation. The self-antagonizing feature of PINK1/TUFm is critical for the robustness of mitophagy regulation, achieved by the unique kinetic parameters of p-S222-TUFm, p-S65-ubiquitin, and their common kinase PINK1. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into mitophagy and mitophagy-associated disorders.	Paradoxical Mitophagy Regulation by PINK1 and TUFm.	Molecular cell
33217317	N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant mRNA modification and is installed by the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP methyltransferase complex. Although the importance of m(6)A methylation in mRNA metabolism has been well documented recently, regulation of the m(6)A machinery remains obscure. Through a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identify the ERK pathway and USP5 as positive regulators of the m(6)A deposition. We find that ERK phosphorylates METTL3 at S43/S50/S525 and WTAP at S306/S341, followed by deubiquitination by USP5, resulting in stabilization of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex. Lack of METTL3/WTAP phosphorylation reduces decay of m(6)A-labeled pluripotent factor transcripts and traps mouse embryonic stem cells in the pluripotent state. The same phosphorylation can also be found in ERK-activated human cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Our study reveals an unrecognized function of ERK in regulating m(6)A methylation.

33171123	Mitochondrial morphology shifts rapidly to manage cellular metabolism, organelle integrity, and cell fate. It remains unknown whether innate nucleic acid sensing, the central and general mechanisms of monitoring both microbial invasion and cellular damage, can reprogram and govern mitochondrial dynamics and function. Here, we unexpectedly observed that upon activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-MAVS signaling, TBK1 directly phosphorylated DRP1/DNM1L, which disabled DRP1, preventing its high-order oligomerization and mitochondrial fragmentation function. The TBK1-DRP1 axis was essential for assembly of large MAVS aggregates and healthy antiviral immunity and underlay nutrient-triggered mitochondrial dynamics and cell fate determination. Knockin (KI) strategies mimicking TBK1-DRP1 signaling produced dominant-negative phenotypes reminiscent of human DRP1 inborn mutations, while interrupting the TBK1-DRP1 connection compromised antiviral responses. Thus, our findings establish an unrecognized function of innate immunity governing both morphology and physiology of a major organelle, identify a lacking loop during innate RNA sensing, and report an elegant mechanism of shaping mitochondrial dynamics.

33232656	Locus control region (LCR) functions define cellular identity and have critical roles in diseases such as cancer, although the hierarchy of structural components and associated factors that drive functionality are incompletely understood. Here we show that OCA-B, a B cell-specific coactivator essential for germinal center (GC) formation, forms a ternary complex with the lymphoid-enriched OCT2 and GC-specific MEF2B transcription factors and that this complex occupies and activates an LCR that regulates the BCL6 proto-oncogene and is uniquely required by normal and malignant GC B cells. Mechanistically, through OCA-B-MED1 interactions, this complex is required for Mediator association with the BCL6 promoter. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only LCR segments heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for its function. Our results demonstrate how an intimately linked complex of lineage- and stage-specific factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the function of a cell-type-defining LCR.

33275888	The anti-tumor potency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) has been linked to trapping of PARP1 on damaged chromatin. However, little is known about their impact on PARP2, an isoform with overlapping functions at DNA lesions. Whether the release of PARP1/2 from DNA lesions is actively catalyzed by molecular machines is also not known. We found that PARPis robustly trap PARP2 and that the helicase ALC1 (CHD1L) is strictly required for PARP2 release. Catalytic inactivation of ALC1 quantitatively traps PARP2 but not PARP1. ALC1 manipulation impacts the response to single-strand DNA breaks through PARP2 trapping, potentiates PARPi-induced cancer cell killing, and mediates synthetic lethality upon BRCA deficiency. The chromatin remodeler ALC1 actively drives PARP2 turnover from DNA lesions, and PARP2 contributes to the cellular responses of PARPi. This suggests that disrupting the ATP-fueled remodeling forces of ALC1 might enable therapies that selectively target the DNA repair functions of PARPs in cancer.

33202251	"Mechanisms that control mobilization of cytosolic calcium [Ca(2+)]i are key for regulation of numerous eukaryotic cell functions. One such paradigmatic mechanism involves activation of phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) enzymes by G protein betagamma subunits from activated Galphai-Gbetagamma heterotrimers. Here, we report identification of a master switch to enable this control for PLCbeta enzymes in living cells. We find that the Galphai-Gbetagamma-PLCbeta-Ca(2+) signaling module is entirely dependent on the presence of active Galphaq. If Galphaq is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated, Gbetagamma can bind to PLCbeta but does not elicit Ca(2+) signals. Removal of an auto-inhibitory linker that occludes the active site of the enzyme is required and sufficient to empower ""stand-alone control"" of PLCbeta by Gbetagamma. This dependence of Gi-Gbetagamma-Ca(2+) on Galphaq places an entire signaling branch of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) under hierarchical control of Gq and changes our understanding of how Gi-GPCRs trigger [Ca(2+)]i via PLCbeta enzymes."

33248027	Reflecting its pleiotropic functions, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) localizes to various sub-cellular structures during mitosis. At kinetochores, PLK1 contributes to microtubule attachments and mitotic checkpoint signaling. Previous studies identified a wealth of potential PLK1 receptors at kinetochores, as well as requirements for various mitotic kinases, including BUB1, Aurora B, and PLK1 itself. Here, we combine ectopic localization, in vitro reconstitution, and kinetochore localization studies to demonstrate that most and likely all of the PLK1 is recruited through BUB1 in the outer kinetochore and centromeric protein U (CENP-U) in the inner kinetochore. BUB1 and CENP-U share a constellation of sequence motifs consisting of a putative PP2A-docking motif and two neighboring PLK1-docking sites, which, contingent on priming phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and PLK1 itself, bind PLK1 and promote its dimerization. Our results rationalize previous observations and describe a unifying mechanism for recruitment of PLK1 to human kinetochores.

33296677	Replication fork reversal is a global response to replication stress in mammalian cells, but precisely how it occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, upon replication stress, DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is recruited to stalled forks in a manner dependent on the SNF2-family DNA translocases HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1. This is accompanied by an increase in TOP2A SUMOylation mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase ZATT and followed by recruitment of a SUMO-targeted DNA translocase, PICH. Disruption of the ZATT-TOP2A-PICH axis results in accumulation of partially reversed forks and enhanced genome instability. These results suggest that fork reversal occurs via a sequential two-step process. First, HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1 initiate limited fork reversal, creating superhelical strain in the newly replicated sister chromatids. Second, TOP2A drives extensive fork reversal by resolving the resulting topological barriers and via its role in recruiting PICH to stalled forks.

33301730	Metazoan transcription factors typically regulate large numbers of genes. Here we identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen ZNF410, a pentadactyl DNA-binding protein that in human erythroid cells directly activates only a single gene, the NuRD component CHD4. Specificity is conveyed by two highly evolutionarily conserved clusters of ZNF410 binding sites near the CHD4 gene with no counterparts elsewhere in the genome. Loss of ZNF410 in adult-type human erythroid cell culture systems and xenotransplantation settings diminishes CHD4 levels and derepresses the fetal hemoglobin genes. While previously known to be silenced by CHD4, the fetal globin genes are exposed here as among the most sensitive to reduced CHD4 levels.. In vitro DNA binding assays and crystallographic studies reveal the ZNF410-DNA binding mode. ZNF410 is a remarkably selective transcriptional activator in erythroid cells, and its perturbation might offer new opportunities for treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

33271062	The mechanisms of cellular energy sensing and AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition are not fully delineated. Here, we discover that RIPK1 promotes mTORC1 inhibition during energetic stress. RIPK1 is involved in mediating the interaction between AMPK and TSC2 and facilitate TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser1387. RIPK1 loss results in a high basal mTORC1 activity that drives defective lysosomes in cells and mice, leading to accumulation of RIPK3 and CASP8 and sensitization to cell death. RIPK1-deficient cells are unable to cope with energetic stress and are vulnerable to low glucose levels and metformin. Inhibition of mTORC1 rescues the lysosomal defects and vulnerability to energetic stress and prolongs the survival of RIPK1-deficient neonatal mice. Thus, RIPK1 plays an important role in the cellular response to low energy levels and mediates AMPK-mTORC1 signaling. These findings shed light on the regulation of mTORC1 during energetic stress and unveil a point of crosstalk between pro-survival and pro-death pathways.	RIPK1 Promotes Energy Sensing by the mTORC1 Pathway.	Molecular cell
33606974	The PI3K pathway regulates cell metabolism, proliferation, and migration, and its dysregulation is common in cancer. We now show that both physiologic and oncogenic activation of PI3K signaling increase the expression of its negative regulator PTEN. This limits the duration of the signal and output of the pathway. Physiologic and pharmacologic inhibition of the pathway reduces PTEN and contributes to the rebound in pathway activity in tumors treated with PI3K inhibitors and limits their efficacy. Regulation of PTEN is due to mTOR/4E-BP1-dependent control of its translation and is lost when 4E-BP1 is deleted. Translational regulation of PTEN is therefore a major homeostatic regulator of physiologic PI3K signaling and plays a role in reducing the pathway activation by oncogenic PIK3CA mutants and the antitumor activity of PI3K pathway inhibitors. However, pathway output is hyperactivated in tumor cells with coexistent PI3K mutation and loss of PTEN function.	Regulation of PTEN translation by PI3K signaling maintains pathway homeostasis.

33476576	Micronuclei are aberrant nuclear compartments that can form as a result of chromosome mis-segregation. Frequent loss of micronuclear envelope integrity exposes DNA to the cytoplasm, leading to chromosome fragmentation and immune activation. Here, we use micronuclei purification to show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated nuclease TREX1 inhibits cGAS activation at micronuclei by degrading micronuclear DNA upon micronuclear envelope rupture. We demonstrate that the ER accesses ruptured micronuclei and plays a critical role in enabling TREX1 nucleolytic attack. TREX1 mutations, previously implicated in immune disease, untether TREX1 from the ER, disrupt TREX1 localization to micronuclei, diminish micronuclear DNA damage, and enhance cGAS activation. These results establish ER-directed resection of micronuclear DNA by TREX1 as a critical regulator of cytosolic DNA sensing in chromosomally unstable cells and provide a mechanistic basis for the importance of TREX1 ER tethering in preventing autoimmunity.	ER-directed TREX1 limits cGAS activation at micronuclei.	Molecular cell
33412112	DNA replication forks use multiple mechanisms to deal with replication stress, but how the choice of mechanisms is made is still poorly understood. Here, we show that CARM1 associates with replication forks and reduces fork speed independently of its methyltransferase activity. The speeding of replication forks in CARM1-deficient cells requires RECQ1, which resolves reversed forks, and RAD18, which promotes translesion synthesis. Loss of CARM1 reduces fork reversal and increases single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps but allows cells to tolerate higher replication stress. Mechanistically, CARM1 interacts with PARP1 and promotes PARylation at replication forks. In vitro, CARM1 stimulates PARP1 activity by enhancing its DNA binding and acts jointly with HPF1 to activate PARP1. Thus, by stimulating PARP1, CARM1 slows replication forks and promotes the use of fork reversal in the stress response, revealing that CARM1 and PARP1 function as a regulatory module at forks to control fork speed and the choice of stress response mechanisms.	CARM1 regulates replication fork speed and stress response by stimulating PARP1.	Molecular cell
33453168	The MYC oncoprotein globally affects the function of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The ability of MYC to promote transcription elongation depends on its ubiquitylation. Here, we show that MYC and PAF1c (polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex) interact directly and mutually enhance each other's association with active promoters. PAF1c is rapidly transferred from MYC onto RNAPII. This transfer is driven by the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase and is required for MYC-dependent transcription elongation. MYC and HUWE1 promote histone H2B ubiquitylation, which alters chromatin structure both for transcription elongation and double-strand break repair. Consistently, MYC suppresses double-strand break accumulation in active genes in a strictly PAF1c-dependent manner. Depletion of PAF1c causes transcription-dependent accumulation of double-strand breaks, despite widespread repair-associated DNA synthesis. Our data show that the transfer of PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII efficiently couples transcription elongation with double-strand break repair to maintain the genomic integrity of MYC-driven tumor cells.	Ubiquitylation of MYC couples transcription elongation with double-strand break repair at active promoters.	Molecular cell
33434504	STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing in dendritic cells (DCs) initiates antitumor immune responses, but how STING signaling is metabolically regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Here, we show that oxidative stress is required for STING-induced DC antitumor function through a process that directs SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3) activity. DC-specific deletion of Senp3 drives tumor progression by blunting STING-dependent type-I interferon (IFN) signaling in DCs and dampening antitumor immune responses. DC-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger SENP3 accumulation and the SENP3-IFI204 interaction, thereby catalyzing IFI204 deSUMOylation and boosting STING signaling activation in mice. Consistently, SENP3 senses ROS to facilitate STING-dependent DC activity in tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients. Our results reveal that oxidative stress as a metabolic regulator promotes STING-mediated DC antitumor immune responses and highlights SENP3 as an overflow valve for STING signaling induction in the metabolically abnormal tumor microenvironment.	SENP3 senses oxidative stress to facilitate STING-dependent dendritic cell antitumor function.	Molecular cell
33453169	The RAD51 recombinase forms nucleoprotein filaments to promote double-strand break repair, replication fork reversal, and fork stabilization. The stability of these filaments is highly regulated, as both too little and too much RAD51 activity can cause genome instability. RADX is a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that regulates DNA replication. Here, we define its mechanism of action. We find that RADX inhibits RAD51 strand exchange and D-loop formation activities. RADX directly and selectively interacts with ATP-bound RAD51, stimulates ATP hydrolysis, and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments. The RADX interaction with RAD51, in addition to its ssDNA binding capability, is required to maintain replication fork elongation rates and fork stability. Furthermore, BRCA2 can overcome the RADX-dependent RAD51 inhibition. Thus, RADX functions in opposition to BRCA2 in regulating RAD51 nucleofilament stability to ensure the right level of RAD51 function during DNA replication.	RADX controls RAD51 filament dynamics to regulate replication fork stability.	Molecular cell
33539787	Aberrant cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, including glioblastoma (GBM). Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 6 activity is required for the proliferation, stem-like properties, and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation in GBM critical for malignancy. We identified a casein kinase 2 (CK2)-PRMT6-regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) signaling axis whose activity is an important contributor to the stem-like properties and tumor biology of GSCs. CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes PRMT6 through deubiquitylation, which promotes PRMT6 methylation of RCC1, which in turn is required for RCC1 association with chromatin and activation of RAN. Disruption of this pathway results in defects in mitosis. EPZ020411, a specific small-molecule inhibitor for PRMT6, suppresses RCC1 arginine methylation and improves the cytotoxic activity of radiotherapy against GSC brain tumor xenografts. This study identifies a CK2alpha-PRMT6-RCC1 signaling axis that can be therapeutically targeted in the treatment of GBM.	PRMT6 methylation of RCC1 regulates mitosis, tumorigenicity, and radiation response of glioblastoma stem cells.	Molecular cell
33761311	The initiation of DNA replication involves cell cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, including the origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 AAA(+) ATPases. We report that multiple short linear protein motifs (SLiMs) within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in ORC1 and CDC6 mediate cyclin-CDK-dependent and independent protein-protein interactions, conditional on the cell cycle phase. A domain within the ORC1 IDR is required for interaction between the ORC1 and CDC6 AAA(+) domains in G1, whereas the same domain prevents CDC6-ORC1 interaction during mitosis. Then, during late G1, this domain facilitates ORC1 destruction by a SKP2-cyclin A-CDK2-dependent mechanism. During G1, the CDC6 Cy motif cooperates with cyclin E-CDK2 to promote ORC1-CDC6 interactions. The CDC6 IDR regulates self-interaction by ORC1, thereby controlling ORC1 protein levels. Protein phosphatase 1 binds directly to a SLiM in the ORC1 IDR, causing ORC1 de-phosphorylation upon mitotic exit, increasing ORC1 protein, and promoting pre-RC assembly.	Multiple, short protein binding motifs in ORC1 and CDC6 control the initiation of DNA replication.	Molecular cell
33756105	Dysregulated mTORC1 signaling alters a wide range of cellular processes, contributing to metabolic disorders and cancer. Defining the molecular details of downstream effectors is thus critical for uncovering selective therapeutic targets. We report that mTORC1 and its downstream kinase S6K enhance eIF4A/4B-mediated translation of Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), an adaptor for the N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methyltransferase complex. This regulation is mediated by 5' UTR of WTAP mRNA that is targeted by eIF4A/4B. Single-nucleotide-resolution m(6)A mapping revealed that MAX dimerization protein 2 (MXD2) mRNA contains m(6)A, and increased m(6)A modification enhances its degradation. WTAP induces cMyc-MAX association by suppressing MXD2 expression, which promotes cMyc transcriptional activity and proliferation of mTORC1-activated cancer cells. These results elucidate a mechanism whereby mTORC1 stimulates oncogenic signaling via m(6)A RNA modification and illuminates the WTAP-MXD2-cMyc axis as a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven cancers.	mTORC1 promotes cell growth via m(6)A-dependent mRNA degradation.	Molecular cell
33756106	The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates metabolism and cell growth in response to nutrient, growth, and oncogenic signals. We found that mTORC1 stimulates the synthesis of the major methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), through the control of methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A) expression. The transcription factor c-MYC, downstream of mTORC1, directly binds to intron 1 of MAT2A and promotes its expression. Furthermore, mTORC1 increases the protein abundance of Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), the positive regulatory subunit of the human N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methyltransferase complex. Through the control of MAT2A and WTAP levels, mTORC1 signaling stimulates m(6)A RNA modification to promote protein synthesis and cell growth. A decline in intracellular SAM levels upon MAT2A inhibition decreases m(6)A RNA modification, protein synthesis rate, and tumor growth. Thus, mTORC1 adjusts m(6)A RNA modification through the control of SAM and WTAP levels to prime the translation machinery for anabolic cell growth.	mTORC1 stimulates cell growth through SAM synthesis and m(6)A mRNA-dependent control of protein synthesis.

33991485	Glutaminase regulates glutaminolysis to promote cancer cell proliferation. However, the mechanism underlying glutaminase activity regulation is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kidney-type glutaminase (GLS) is highly expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens with correspondingly upregulated glutamine dependence for PDAC cell proliferation. Upon oxidative stress, the succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase ADP-forming subunit beta (SUCLA2) phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at S79 dissociates from GLS, resulting in enhanced GLS K311 succinylation, oligomerization, and activity. Activated GLS increases glutaminolysis and the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and promoting tumor cell survival and tumor growth in mice. In addition, the levels of SUCLA2 pS79 and GLS K311 succinylation, which were mutually correlated, were positively associated with advanced stages of PDAC and poor prognosis for patients. Our findings reveal critical regulation of GLS by SUCLA2-coupled GLS succinylation regulation and underscore the regulatory role of metabolites in glutaminolysis and PDAC development.	SUCLA2-coupled regulation of GLS succinylation and activity counteracts oxidative stress in tumor cells.	Molecular cell
33909988	Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms, AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer.	Energy status dictates PD-L1 protein abundance and anti-tumor immunity to enable checkpoint blockade.	Molecular cell
33974912	Meningioma-1 (MN1) overexpression in AML is associated with poor prognosis, and forced expression of MN1 induces leukemia in mice. We sought to determine how MN1 causes AML. We found that overexpression of MN1 can be induced by translocations that result in hijacking of a downstream enhancer. Structure predictions revealed that the entire MN1 coding frame is disordered. We identified the myeloid progenitor-specific BAF complex as the key interaction partner of MN1. MN1 over-stabilizes BAF on enhancer chromatin, a function directly linked to the presence of a long polyQ-stretch within MN1. BAF over-stabilization at binding sites of transcription factors regulating a hematopoietic stem/progenitor program prevents the developmentally appropriate decommissioning of these enhancers and results in impaired myeloid differentiation and leukemia. Beyond AML, our data detail how the overexpression of a polyQ protein, in the absence of any coding sequence mutation, can be sufficient to cause malignant transformation.	Intrinsically disordered Meningioma-1 stabilizes the BAF complex to cause AML.	Molecular cell
33852894	Small RNA pathways defend the germlines of animals against selfish genetic elements, yet pathway activities need to be contained to prevent silencing of self genes. Here, we reveal a proteolytic mechanism that controls endogenous small interfering (22G) RNA activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline to protect genome integrity and maintain fertility. We find that DPF-3, a P-granule-localized N-terminal dipeptidase orthologous to mammalian dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8/9, processes the unusually proline-rich N termini of WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 Argonaute (Ago) proteins. Without DPF-3 activity, these WAGO proteins lose their proper complement of 22G RNAs. Desilencing of repeat-containing and transposon-derived transcripts, DNA damage, and acute sterility ensue. These phenotypes are recapitulated when WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are rendered resistant to DPF-3-mediated processing, identifying them as critical substrates of DPF-3. We conclude that N-terminal processing of Ago proteins regulates their activity and promotes silencing of selfish genetic elements by ensuring Ago association with appropriate small RNAs.	Protease-mediated processing of Argonaute proteins controls small RNA association.	Molecular cell
33961797	53BP1 influences genome stability via two independent mechanisms: (1) regulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and (2) enhancing p53 activity. We discovered a protein, Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that associates with the 53BP1 Tudor domain and prevents its recruitment to DSBs. Here, we elucidate how TIRR affects 53BP1 function beyond its recruitment to DSBs and biochemically links the two distinct roles of 53BP1. Loss of TIRR causes an aberrant increase in the gene transactivation function of p53, affecting several p53-mediated cell-fate programs. TIRR inhibits the complex formation between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 (K382me2) that is poised for transcriptional activation of its target genes. TIRR mRNA expression levels negatively correlate with the expression of key p53 target genes in breast and prostate cancers. Further, TIRR loss is selectively not tolerated in p53-proficient tumors. Therefore, we establish that TIRR is an important inhibitor of the 53BP1-p53 complex.	TIRR inhibits the 53BP1-p53 complex to alter cell-fate programs.	Molecular cell
33961796	p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) regulates both the DNA damage response and p53 signaling. Although 53BP1's function is well established in DNA double-strand break repair, how its role in p53 signaling is modulated remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the scaffolding protein AHNAK as a G1 phase-enriched interactor of 53BP1. We demonstrate that AHNAK binds to the 53BP1 oligomerization domain and controls its multimerization potential. Loss of AHNAK results in hyper-accumulation of 53BP1 on chromatin and enhanced phase separation, culminating in an elevated p53 response, compromising cell survival in cancer cells but leading to senescence in non-transformed cells. Cancer transcriptome analyses indicate that AHNAK-53BP1 cooperation contributes to the suppression of p53 target gene networks in tumors and that loss of AHNAK sensitizes cells to combinatorial cancer treatments. These findings highlight AHNAK as a rheostat of 53BP1 function, which surveys cell proliferation by preventing an excessive p53 response.	AHNAK controls 53BP1-mediated p53 response by restraining 53BP1 oligomerization and phase separation.	Molecular cell
33857404	The Shieldin complex shields double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic resection. Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1, is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1, and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1, thereby ensuring a proper balance between end protection and resection during DSB repair. The loss of THAP1-dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross-resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and cisplatin in BRCA1-deficient cells and shorter progression-free survival in ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, the embryonic lethality and PARPi sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient mice is rescued by ablation of SHLD1. Our study uncovers a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB repair choice and suggests a potential link between DNA damage and pathogenic THAP1 mutations, found in patients with the neurodevelopmental movement disorder adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6.	The dystonia gene THAP1 controls DNA double-strand break repair choice.	Molecular cell
33964204	The assembly of nascent proteins into multi-subunit complexes is a tightly regulated process that must occur at high fidelity to maintain cellular homeostasis. The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) is an essential insertase that requires seven membrane-spanning and two soluble cytosolic subunits to function. Here, we show that the kinase with no lysine 1 (WNK1), known for its role in hypertension and neuropathy, functions as an assembly factor for the human EMC. WNK1 uses a conserved amphipathic helix to stabilize the soluble subunit, EMC2, by binding to the EMC2-8 interface. Shielding this hydrophobic surface prevents promiscuous interactions of unassembled EMC2 and directly competes for binding of E3 ubiquitin ligases, permitting assembly. Depletion of WNK1 thus destabilizes both the EMC and its membrane protein clients. This work describes an unexpected role for WNK1 in protein biogenesis and defines the general requirements of an assembly factor that will apply across the proteome.	WNK1 is an assembly factor for the human ER membrane protein complex.	Molecular cell
33974911	The TSC complex is a critical negative regulator of the small GTPase Rheb and mTORC1 in cellular stress signaling. The TSC2 subunit contains a catalytic GTPase activating protein domain and interacts with multiple regulators, while the precise function of TSC1 is unknown. Here we provide a structural characterization of TSC1 and define three domains: a C-terminal coiled-coil that interacts with TSC2, a central helical domain that mediates TSC1 oligomerization, and an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain that interacts with membrane phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). TSC1 architecture, oligomerization, and membrane binding are conserved in fungi and humans. We show that lysosomal recruitment of the TSC complex and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1 upon starvation depend on the marker lipid PI3,5P2, demonstrating a role for lysosomal PIPs in regulating TSC complex and mTORC1 activity via TSC1. Our study thus identifies a vital role of TSC1 in TSC complex function and mTORC1 signaling.	TSC1 binding to lysosomal PIPs is required for TSC complex translocation and mTORC1 regulation.	Molecular cell
34077757	Lipid droplets are important for cancer cell growth and survival. However, the mechanism underlying the initiation of lipid droplet lipolysis is not well understood. We demonstrate here that glucose deprivation induces the binding of choline kinase (CHK) alpha2 to lipid droplets, which is sequentially mediated by AMPK-dependent CHKalpha2 S279 phosphorylation and KAT5-dependent CHKalpha2 K247 acetylation. Importantly, CHKalpha2 with altered catalytic domain conformation functions as a protein kinase and phosphorylates PLIN2 at Y232 and PLIN3 at Y251. The phosphorylated PLIN2/3 dissociate from lipid droplets and are degraded by Hsc70-mediated autophagy, thereby promoting lipid droplet lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of CHKalpha2 S279 phosphorylation, CHKalpha2 K247 acetylation, and PLIN2/3 phosphorylation are positively correlated with one another in human glioblastoma specimens and are associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. These findings underscore the role of CHKalpha2 as a protein kinase in lipolysis and glioblastoma development.	Choline kinase alpha 2 acts as a protein kinase to promote lipolysis of lipid droplets.

33932349	Cholesterol metabolism is tightly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, the clinical benefit of statins, the inhibitor of cholesterol biogenesis mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is inconclusive, possibly because of a lack of patient stratification criteria. Here, we describe that YAP-mediated zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8) expression sensitizes intestinal tumors to the inhibition of the MVA pathway. We show that the oncogenic activity of YAP relies largely on ZMYND8 to enhance intracellular de novo cholesterol biogenesis. Disruption of the ZMYND8-dependent MVA pathway greatly restricts the self-renewal capacity of Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 and SREBP2 drive the enhancer-promoter interaction to facilitate the recruitment of Mediator complex, thus upregulating MVA pathway genes. Together, our results establish that the epigenetic reader ZMYND8 endows YAP-high intestinal cancer with metabolic vulnerability.	The ZMYND8-regulated mevalonate pathway endows YAP-high intestinal cancer with metabolic vulnerability.	Molecular cell
33979575	DNA replication initiates at genomic locations known as origins of replication, which, in S. cerevisiae, share a common DNA consensus motif. Despite being virtually nucleosome-free, origins of replication are greatly influenced by the surrounding chromatin state. Here, we show that histone H3 lysine 37 mono-methylation (H3K37me1) is catalyzed by Set1p and Set2p and that it regulates replication origin licensing. H3K37me1 is uniformly distributed throughout most of the genome, but it is scarce at replication origins, where it increases according to the timing of their firing. We find that H3K37me1 hinders Mcm2 interaction with chromatin, maintaining low levels of MCM outside of conventional replication origins. Lack of H3K37me1 results in defective DNA replication from canonical origins while promoting replication events at inefficient and non-canonical sites. Collectively, our results indicate that H3K37me1 ensures correct execution of the DNA replication program by protecting the genome from inappropriate origin licensing and spurious DNA replication.	Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 37 by Set1 and Set2 prevents spurious DNA replication.	Molecular cell
34111399	The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway senses cytosolic DNA and induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to activate the innate immune system. Here, we report the unexpected discovery that cGAS also senses dysfunctional protein production. Purified ribosomes interact directly with cGAS and stimulate its DNA-dependent activity in vitro. Disruption of the ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway, which detects and resolves ribosome collision during translation, results in cGAS-dependent ISG expression and causes re-localization of cGAS from the nucleus to the cytosol. Indeed, cGAS preferentially binds collided ribosomes in vitro, and orthogonal perturbations that result in elevated levels of collided ribosomes and RQC activation cause sub-cellular re-localization of cGAS and ribosome binding in vivo as well. Thus, translation stress potently increases DNA-dependent cGAS activation. These findings have implications for the inflammatory response to viral infection and tumorigenesis, both of which substantially reprogram cellular protein synthesis.	Translation stress and collided ribosomes are co-activators of cGAS.	Molecular cell
34111398	The transition of oxidized 5-methylcytosine (5mC) intermediates into the base excision repair (BER) pipeline to complete DNA demethylation remains enigmatic. We report here that UHRF2, the only paralog of UHRF1 in mammals that fails to rescue Uhrf1(-/-) phenotype, is physically and functionally associated with BER complex. We show that UHRF2 is allosterically activated by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to catalyze K33-linked polyubiquitination of XRCC1. This nonproteolytic action stimulates XRCC1's interaction with the ubiquitin binding domain-bearing RAD23B, leading to the incorporation of TDG into BER complex. Integrative epigenomic analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals that Uhrf2-fostered TDG-RAD23B-BER complex is functionally linked to the completion of DNA demethylation at active promoters and that Uhrf2 ablation impedes DNA demethylation on latent enhancers that undergo poised-to-active transition during neuronal commitment. Together, these observations highlight an essentiality of 5hmC-switched UHRF2 E3 ligase activity in commissioning the accomplishment of active DNA demethylation.	UHRF2 commissions the completion of DNA demethylation through allosteric activation by 5hmC and K33-linked ubiquitination of XRCC1.	Molecular cell
34197737	Stalled DNA replication fork restart after stress as orchestrated by ATR kinase, BLM helicase, and structure-specific nucleases enables replication, cell survival, and genome stability. Here we unveil human exonuclease V (EXO5) as an ATR-regulated DNA structure-specific nuclease and BLM partner for replication fork restart. We find that elevated EXO5 in tumors correlates with increased mutation loads and poor patient survival, suggesting that EXO5 upregulation has oncogenic potential. Structural, mechanistic, and mutational analyses of EXO5 and EXO5-DNA complexes reveal a single-stranded DNA binding channel with an adjacent ATR phosphorylation motif (T88Q89) that regulates EXO5 nuclease activity and BLM binding identified by mass spectrometric analysis. EXO5 phospho-mimetic mutant rescues the restart defect from EXO5 depletion that decreases fork progression, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. EXO5 depletion furthermore rescues survival of FANCA-deficient cells and indicates EXO5 functions epistatically with SMARCAL1 and BLM. Thus, an EXO5 axis connects ATR and BLM in directing replication fork restart.	EXO5-DNA structure and BLM interactions direct DNA resection critical for ATR-dependent replication restart.

34107305	RAD51 facilitates replication fork reversal and protects reversed forks from nuclease degradation. Although potentially a useful replication stress response mechanism, unregulated fork reversal can cause genome instability. Here we show that RADX, a single-strand DNA binding protein that binds to and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments, can either inhibit or promote fork reversal depending on replication stress levels. RADX inhibits fork reversal at elongating forks, thereby preventing fork slowing and collapse. Paradoxically, in the presence of persistent replication stress, RADX localizes to stalled forks to generate reversed fork structures. Consequently, inactivating RADX prevents fork-reversal-dependent telomere dysfunction in the absence of RTEL1 and blocks nascent strand degradation when fork protection factors are inactivated. Addition of RADX increases SMARCAL1-dependent fork reversal in conditions in which pre-binding RAD51 to a model fork substrate is inhibitory. Thus, RADX directly interacts with RAD51 and single-strand DNA to confine fork reversal to persistently stalled forks.	RADX prevents genome instability by confining replication fork reversal to stalled forks.	Molecular cell
34171297	Accurate control of innate immune responses is required to eliminate invading pathogens and simultaneously avoid autoinflammation and autoimmune diseases. Here, we demonstrate that arginine monomethylation precisely regulates the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral response. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) forms aggregates to catalyze MAVS monomethylation at arginine residue 52 (R52), attenuating its binding to TRIM31 and RIG-I, which leads to the suppression of MAVS aggregation and subsequent activation. Upon virus infection, aggregated PRMT7 is disabled in a timely manner due to automethylation at arginine residue 32 (R32), and SMURF1 is recruited to PRMT7 by MAVS to induce proteasomal degradation of PRMT7, resulting in the relief of PRMT7 suppression of MAVS activation. Therefore, we not only reveal that arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 negatively regulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling in vitro and in vivo but also uncover a mechanism by which PRMT7 is tightly controlled to ensure the timely activation of antiviral defense.	Arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 controls MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity.	Molecular cell
34157307	OTULIN coordinates with LUBAC to edit linear polyubiquitin chains in embryonic development, autoimmunity, and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which angiogenesis, especially that of endothelial cells (ECs), is regulated by linear ubiquitination remains unclear. Here, we reveal that constitutive or EC-specific deletion of Otulin resulted in arteriovenous malformations and embryonic lethality. LUBAC conjugates linear ubiquitin chains onto Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), which is responsible for angiogenesis defects, inhibiting ALK1 enzyme activity and Smad1/5 activation. Conversely, OTULIN deubiquitinates ALK1 to promote Smad1/5 activation. Consistently, embryonic survival of Otulin-deficient mice was prolonged by BMP9 pretreatment or EC-specific ALK1(Q200D) (constitutively active) knockin. Moreover, mutant ALK1 from type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT2) patients exhibited excessive linear ubiquitination and increased HOIP binding. As such, a HOIP inhibitor restricted the excessive angiogenesis of ECs derived from ALK1(G309S)-expressing HHT2 patients. These results show that OTULIN and LUBAC govern ALK1 activity to balance EC angiogenesis.	OTULIN allies with LUBAC to govern angiogenesis by editing ALK1 linear polyubiquitin.	Molecular cell
34245671	Cells communicate with their environment via surface proteins and secreted factors. Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) is an evolutionarily conserved process, via which distinct cargo proteins are secreted upon stress. Most UPS types depend upon the Golgi-associated GRASP55 protein. However, its regulation and biological role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) directly phosphorylates GRASP55 to maintain its Golgi localization, thus revealing a physiological role for mTORC1 at this organelle. Stimuli that inhibit mTORC1 cause GRASP55 dephosphorylation and relocalization to UPS compartments. Through multiple, unbiased, proteomic analyses, we identify numerous cargoes that follow this unconventional secretory route to reshape the cellular secretome and surfactome. Using MMP2 secretion as a proxy for UPS, we provide important insights on its regulation and physiological role. Collectively, our findings reveal the mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling hub as the integration point in stress signaling upstream of UPS and as a key coordinator of the cellular adaptation to stress.	An mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling axis controls unconventional secretion to reshape the extracellular proteome upon stress.	Molecular cell
34358447	"The transformed state in acute leukemia requires gene regulatory programs involving transcription factors and chromatin modulators. Here, we uncover an IRF8-MEF2D transcriptional circuit as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-biased dependency. We discover and characterize the mechanism by which the chromatin ""reader"" ZMYND8 directly activates IRF8 in parallel with the MYC proto-oncogene through their lineage-specific enhancers. ZMYND8 is essential for AML proliferation in vitro and in vivo and associates with MYC and IRF8 enhancer elements that we define in cell lines and in patient samples. ZMYND8 occupancy at IRF8 and MYC enhancers requires BRD4, a transcription coactivator also necessary for AML proliferation. We show that ZMYND8 binds to the ET domain of BRD4 via its chromatin reader cassette, which in turn is required for proper chromatin occupancy and maintenance of leukemic growth in vivo. Our results rationalize ZMYND8 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating essential transcriptional programs in AML."	ZMYND8-regulated IRF8 transcription axis is an acute myeloid leukemia dependency.	Molecular cell
34547240	Mitochondrial dynamics regulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission maintain mitochondrial functions, whose alterations underline various human diseases. Here, we show that inositol is a critical metabolite directly restricting AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission independently of its classical mode as a precursor for phosphoinositide generation. Inositol decline by IMPA1/2 deficiency elicits AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission without affecting ATP level, whereas inositol accumulation prevents AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Metabolic stress or mitochondrial damage causes inositol decline in cells and mice to elicit AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Inositol directly binds to AMPKgamma and competes with AMP for AMPKgamma binding, leading to restriction of AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission. Our study suggests that the AMP/inositol ratio is a critical determinant for AMPK activation and establishes a model in which AMPK activation requires inositol decline to release AMPKgamma for AMP binding. Hence, AMPK is an inositol sensor, whose inactivation by inositol serves as a mechanism to restrict mitochondrial fission.	Inositol serves as a natural inhibitor of mitochondrial fission by directly targeting AMPK.	Molecular cell
34233158	A metabolic imbalance between lipid synthesis and degradation can lead to hepatic lipid accumulation, a characteristic of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we report that high-fat-diet-induced sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a key transcription factor that regulates lipid biosynthesis, impairs autophagic lipid catabolism via altered H2S signaling. SREBP-1c reduced cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) via miR-216a, which in turn decreased hepatic H2S levels and sulfhydration-dependent activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1). Furthermore, Cys951Ser mutation of ULK1 decreased autolysosome formation and promoted hepatic lipid accumulation in mice, suggesting that the loss of ULK1 sulfhydration was directly associated with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Moreover, silencing of CSE in SREBP-1c knockout mice increased liver triglycerides, confirming the connection between CSE, autophagy, and SREBP-1c. Overall, our results uncover a 2-fold mechanism for SREBP-1c-driven hepatic lipid accumulation through reciprocal activation and inhibition of hepatic lipid biosynthesis and degradation, respectively.	SREBP-1c impairs ULK1 sulfhydration-mediated autophagic flux to promote hepatic steatosis in high-fat-diet-fed mice.	Molecular cell
34289383	Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 play a pathogenic role in cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by producing oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1 and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2 is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.	Lysine acetylation restricts mutant IDH2 activity to optimize transformation in AML cells.	Molecular cell

34624217	Deregulation of oncogenic signals in cancer triggers replication stress. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are rapidly and transiently expressed following stressful signals, contributing to an integrated response. Here, we find that the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 localizes across the gene body and 3' UTR of IEGs, where it inhibits transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II, generating R-loops and accessible chromatin domains. Acute replication stress causes immediate dissociation of NR4A1 and a burst of transcriptionally poised IEG expression. Ectopic expression of NR4A1 enhances tumorigenesis by breast cancer cells, while its deletion leads to massive chromosomal instability and proliferative failure, driven by deregulated expression of its IEG target, FOS. Approximately half of breast and other primary cancers exhibit accessible chromatin domains at IEG gene bodies, consistent with this stress-regulatory pathway. Cancers that have retained this mechanism in adapting to oncogenic replication stress may be dependent on NR4A1 for their proliferation.	NR4A1 regulates expression of immediate early genes, suppressing replication stress in cancer.	Molecular cell
34453890	Missense mutations of the tumor suppressor Neurofibromin 2 (NF2/Merlin/schwannomin) result in sporadic to frequent occurrences of tumorigenesis in multiple organs. However, the underlying pathogenicity of NF2-related tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. Here we found that NF2 facilitated innate immunity by regulating YAP/TAZ-mediated TBK1 inhibition. Unexpectedly, patient-derived individual mutations in the FERM domain of NF2 (NF2m) converted NF2 into a potent suppressor of cGAS-STING signaling. Mechanistically, NF2m gained extreme associations with IRF3 and TBK1 and, upon innate nucleic acid sensing, was directly induced by the activated IRF3 to form cellular condensates, which contained the PP2A complex, to eliminate TBK1 activation. Accordingly, NF2m robustly suppressed STING-initiated antitumor immunity in cancer cell-autonomous and -nonautonomous murine models, and NF2m-IRF3 condensates were evident in human vestibular schwannomas. Our study reports phase separation-mediated quiescence of cGAS-STING signaling by a mutant tumor suppressor and reveals gain-of-function pathogenesis for NF2-related tumors by regulating antitumor immunity.	Induced phase separation of mutant NF2 imprisons the cGAS-STING machinery to abrogate antitumor immunity.	Molecular cell
32943575	SNAI2/SLUG, a metastasis-promoting transcription factor, is a labile protein that is degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome degradation system. Here, we conducted comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function screens using a human DUB cDNA library of 65 genes and an siRNA library of 98 genes, and identified USP20 as a deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates SNAI2 ubiquitination and stability. Further investigation of USP20 demonstrated its function in promoting migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. USP20 positively correlates with SNAI2 protein level in breast tumor samples, and higher USP20 expression is associated with poor prognosis in ER(-) breast cancer patients.	Deubiquitinase USP20 promotes breast cancer metastasis by stabilizing SNAI2.	Genes & development
32912902	The uptake of macromolecules and cellular debris through macropinocytosis has emerged as an important nutrient acquisition strategy of cancer cells. Genetic alterations commonly found in human cancers (e.g. mutations in KRAS or loss of PTEN) have been shown to increase macropinocytosis. To identify additional effectors that enable cell growth dependent on the uptake of extracellular proteins, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells were selected for growth in medium where extracellular albumin was the obligate source of the essential amino acid leucine. Analysis of global changes in chromatin availability and gene expression revealed that PDA cells selected under these conditions exhibited elevated activity of the transcriptional activators Yap/Taz. Knockout of Yap/Taz prevented growth of PDA cells in leucine-deficient medium, but not in complete medium. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of Yap or Taz were sufficient to stimulate macropinocytosis of extracellular protein. In addition to promoting the uptake of plasma proteins, Yap/Taz also promoted the scavenging of apoptotic cell bodies and necrotic debris by PDA cells. The Yap/Taz transcriptional target Axl was found to be essential for cell growth dependent on the uptake of dead cells and cell debris. Together, these studies suggest that the Hippo pathway effectors Yap and Taz are important transcriptional regulators of endocytic nutrient uptake.	Yap/Taz promote the scavenging of extracellular nutrients through macropinocytosis.	Genes & development
33060135	"CDK7 associates with the 10-subunit TFIIH complex and regulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Few additional CDK7 substrates are known. Here, using the covalent inhibitor SY-351 and quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified CDK7 kinase substrates in human cells. Among hundreds of high-confidence targets, the vast majority are unique to CDK7 (i.e., distinct from other transcription-associated kinases), with a subset that suggest novel cellular functions. Transcription-associated factors were predominant CDK7 substrates, including SF3B1, U2AF2, and other splicing components. Accordingly, widespread and diverse splicing defects, such as alternative exon inclusion and intron retention, were characterized in CDK7-inhibited cells. Combined with biochemical assays, we establish that CDK7 directly activates other transcription-associated kinases CDK9, CDK12, and CDK13, invoking a ""master regulator"" role in transcription. We further demonstrate that TFIIH restricts CDK7 kinase function to the RNAPII CTD, whereas other substrates (e.g., SPT5 and SF3B1) are phosphorylated by the three-subunit CDK-activating kinase (CAK; CCNH, MAT1, and CDK7). These results suggest new models for CDK7 function in transcription and implicate CAK dissociation from TFIIH as essential for kinase activation. This straightforward regulatory strategy ensures CDK7 activation is spatially and temporally linked to transcription, and may apply toward other transcription-associated kinases."	Selective inhibition of CDK7 reveals high-confidence targets and new models for TFIIH function in transcription.	Genes & development
33060136	Macrophages polarize into functionally distinct subtypes while responding to microenvironmental cues. The identity of proximal transcription factors (TFs) downstream from the polarization signals are known, but their activity is typically transient, failing to explain the long-term, stable epigenomic programs developed. Here, we mapped the early and late epigenomic changes of interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced alternative macrophage polarization. We identified the TF, early growth response 2 (EGR2), bridging the early transient and late stable gene expression program of polarization. EGR2 is a direct target of IL-4-activated STAT6, having broad action indispensable for 77% of the induced gene signature of alternative polarization, including its autoregulation and a robust, downstream TF cascade involving PPARG. Mechanistically, EGR2 binding results in chromatin opening and the recruitment of chromatin remodelers and RNA polymerase II. Egr2 induction is evolutionarily conserved during alternative polarization of mouse and human macrophages. In the context of tissue resident macrophages, Egr2 expression is most prominent in the lung of a variety of species. Thus, EGR2 is an example of an essential and evolutionarily conserved broad acting factor, linking transient polarization signals to stable epigenomic and transcriptional changes in macrophages.	The transcription factor EGR2 is the molecular linchpin connecting STAT6 activation to the late, stable epigenomic program of alternative macrophage polarization.	Genes & development
33033055	Catalytic-inactivating mutations within the Drosophila enhancer H3K4 mono-methyltransferase Trr and its mammalian homologs, MLL3/4, cause only minor changes in gene expression compared with whole-gene deletions for these COMPASS members. To identify essential histone methyltransferase-independent functions of Trr, we screened to identify a minimal Trr domain sufficient to rescue Trr-null lethality and demonstrate that this domain binds and stabilizes Utx in vivo. Using the homologous MLL3/MLL4 human sequences, we mapped a short approximately 80-amino-acid UTX stabilization domain (USD) that promotes UTX stability in the absence of the rest of MLL3/4. Nuclear UTX stability is enhanced when the USD is fused with the MLL4 HMG-box. Thus, COMPASS-dependent UTX stabilization is an essential noncatalytic function of Trr/MLL3/MLL4, suggesting that stabilizing UTX could be a therapeutic strategy for cancers with MLL3/4 loss-of-function mutations.	A small UTX stabilization domain of Trr is conserved within mammalian MLL3-4/COMPASS and is sufficient to rescue loss of viability in null animals.	Genes & development
33334821	p53 is an intensely studied tumor-suppressive transcription factor. Recent studies suggest that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) ZMAT3 is important in mediating the tumor-suppressive effects of p53. Here, we globally identify ZMAT3-regulated RNAs and their binding sites at nucleotide resolution in intact colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. ZMAT3 binds to thousands of mRNA precursors, mainly at intronic uridine-rich sequences and affects their splicing. The strongest alternatively spliced ZMAT3 target was CD44, a cell adhesion gene and stem cell marker that controls tumorigenesis. Silencing ZMAT3 increased inclusion of CD44 variant exons, resulting in significant up-regulation of oncogenic CD44 isoforms (CD44v) and increased CRC cell growth that was rescued by concurrent knockdown of CD44v Silencing p53 phenocopied the loss of ZMAT3 with respect to CD44 alternative splicing, suggesting that ZMAT3-mediated regulation of CD44 splicing is vital for p53 function. Collectively, our findings uncover a p53-ZMAT3-CD44 axis in growth suppression in CRC cells.	The p53-induced RNA-binding protein ZMAT3 is a splicing regulator that inhibits the splicing of oncogenic CD44 variants in colorectal carcinoma.	Genes & development
33334822	The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is activated by metabolic stress and promotes the development of metabolic syndrome, including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. This integrated physiological response involves cross-talk between different organs. Here we demonstrate that JNK signaling in adipocytes causes an increased circulating concentration of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) that regulates systemic metabolism. The mechanism of organ crosstalk is mediated by a feed-forward regulatory loop caused by JNK-regulated FGF21 autocrine signaling in adipocytes that promotes increased expression of the adipokine adiponectin and subsequent hepatic expression of the hormone FGF21. The mechanism of organ cross-talk places circulating adiponectin downstream of autocrine FGF21 expressed by adipocytes and upstream of endocrine FGF21 expressed by hepatocytes. This regulatory loop represents a novel signaling paradigm that connects autocrine and endocrine signaling modes of the same hormone in different tissues.	A feed-forward regulatory loop in adipose tissue promotes signaling by the hepatokine FGF21.	Genes & development
33446568	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease characterized by late diagnosis, propensity for early metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Little is known about the mechanisms that drive innate therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancer. The ataxia-telangiectasia group D-associated gene (ATDC) is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Our study reveals that increased ATDC levels protect cancer cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) via stabilization of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Mechanistically, ATDC binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), the principal regulator of NRF2 degradation, and thereby prevents degradation of NRF2 resulting in activation of a NRF2-dependent transcriptional program, reduced intracellular ROS and enhanced chemoresistance. Our findings define a novel role of ATDC in regulating redox balance and chemotherapeutic resistance by modulating NRF2 activity.	ATDC binds to KEAP1 to drive NRF2-mediated tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.	Genes & development
33602872	Senescence is a key barrier to neoplastic transformation. To identify senescence regulators relevant to cancer, we screened a genome-wide shRNA library. Here, we describe exportin 7 (XPO7) as a novel regulator of senescence and validate its function in telomere-induced, replicative, and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). XPO7 is a bidirectional transporter that regulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of a broad range of substrates. Depletion of XPO7 results in reduced levels of TCF3 and an impaired induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1) during OIS. Deletion of XPO7 correlates with poorer overall survival in several cancer types. Moreover, depletion of XPO7 alleviated OIS and increased tumor formation in a mouse model of liver cancer. Our results suggest that XPO7 is a novel tumor suppressor that regulates p21(CIP1) expression to control senescence and tumorigenesis.	XPO7 is a tumor suppressor regulating p21(CIP1)-dependent senescence.	Genes & development
33985971	Myocardin, a potent coactivator of serum response factor (SRF), competes with ternary complex factor (TCF) proteins for SRF binding to balance opposing mitogenic and myogenic gene programs in cardiac and smooth muscle. Here we identify a cardiac lncRNA transcribed adjacent to myocardin, named CARDINAL, which antagonizes SRF-dependent mitogenic gene transcription in the heart. CARDINAL-deficient mice show ectopic TCF/SRF-dependent mitogenic gene expression and decreased cardiac contractility in response to age and ischemic stress. CARDINAL forms a nuclear complex with SRF and inhibits TCF-mediated transactivation of the promitogenic gene c-fos, suggesting CARDINAL functions as an RNA cofactor for SRF in the heart.	A myocardin-adjacent lncRNA balances SRF-dependent gene transcription in the heart.	Genes & development
34140355	Kinesin-1 carries cargos including proteins, RNAs, vesicles, and pathogens over long distances within cells. The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood. Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.

34301766	Lung adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent lung cancer subtype, is characterized by its high propensity to metastasize. Despite the importance of metastasis in lung cancer mortality, its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we identified miR-200 miRNAs as potent suppressors for lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. miR-200 expression is specifically repressed in mouse metastatic lung adenocarcinomas, and miR-200 decrease strongly correlates with poor patient survival. Consistently, deletion of mir-200c/141 in the Kras (LSL-G12D/+) ; Trp53 (flox/flox) lung adenocarcinoma mouse model significantly promoted metastasis, generating a desmoplastic tumor stroma highly reminiscent of metastatic human lung cancer. miR-200 deficiency in lung cancer cells promotes the proliferation and activation of adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in turn elevates the metastatic potential of cancer cells. miR-200 regulates the functional interaction between cancer cells and CAFs, at least in part, by targeting Notch ligand Jagged1 and Jagged2 in cancer cells and inducing Notch activation in adjacent CAFs. Hence, the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs constitutes an essential mechanism to promote metastatic potential.	miR-200 deficiency promotes lung cancer metastasis by activating Notch signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts.

34301769	"In all organisms with circadian clocks, post-translational modifications of clock proteins control the dynamics of circadian rhythms, with phosphorylation playing a dominant role. All major clock proteins are highly phosphorylated, and many kinases have been described to be responsible. In contrast, it is largely unclear whether and to what extent their counterparts, the phosphatases, play an equally crucial role. To investigate this, we performed a systematic RNAi screen in human cells and identified protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) with its regulatory subunit PPP4R2 as critical components of the circadian system in both mammals and Drosophila Genetic depletion of PPP4 shortens the circadian period, whereas overexpression lengthens it. PPP4 inhibits CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation activity by binding to BMAL1 and counteracting its phosphorylation. This leads to increased CLOCK/BMAL1 DNA occupancy and decreased transcriptional activity, which counteracts the ""kamikaze"" properties of CLOCK/BMAL1. Through this mechanism, PPP4 contributes to the critical delay of negative feedback by retarding PER/CRY/CK1delta-mediated inhibition of CLOCK/BMAL1."	Protein phosphatase 4 controls circadian clock dynamics by modulating CLOCK/BMAL1 activity.	Genes & development
34244292	The establishment of cell fates involves alterations of transcription factor repertoires and repurposing of transcription factors by post-translational modifications. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the chromatin organizers SATB2 and SATB1 balance pluripotency and differentiation by activating and repressing pluripotency genes, respectively. Here, we show that conditional Satb2 gene inactivation weakens ESC pluripotency, and we identify SUMO2 modification of SATB2 by the E3 ligase ZFP451 as a potential driver of ESC differentiation. Mutations of two SUMO-acceptor lysines of Satb2 (Satb2 (K -->) (R) ) or knockout of Zfp451 impair the ability of ESCs to silence pluripotency genes and activate differentiation-associated genes in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Notably, the forced expression of a SUMO2-SATB2 fusion protein in either Satb2 (K -->) (R) or Zfp451 (-/-) ESCs rescues, in part, their impaired differentiation potential and enhances the down-regulation of Nanog The differentiation defect of Satb2 (K -->) (R) ESCs correlates with altered higher-order chromatin interactions relative to Satb2 (wt) ESCs. Upon RA treatment of Satb2 (wt) ESCs, SATB2 interacts with ZFP451 and the LSD1/CoREST complex and gains binding at differentiation genes, which is not observed in RA-treated Satb2 (K -->) (R) cells. Thus, SATB2 SUMOylation may contribute to the rewiring of transcriptional networks and the chromatin interactome of ESCs in the transition of pluripotency to differentiation.	ZFP451-mediated SUMOylation of SATB2 drives embryonic stem cell differentiation.	Genes & development
32207772	Accurate chromosome segregation demands efficient capture of microtubules by kinetochores and their conversion to stable bioriented attachments that can congress and then segregate chromosomes. An early event is the shedding of the outermost fibrous corona layer of the kinetochore following microtubule attachment. Centromere protein F (CENP-F) is part of the corona, contains two microtubule-binding domains, and physically associates with dynein motor regulators. Here, we have combined CRISPR gene editing and engineered separation-of-function mutants to define how CENP-F contributes to kinetochore function. We show that the two microtubule-binding domains make distinct contributions to attachment stability and force transduction but are dispensable for chromosome congression. We further identify a specialized domain that functions to limit the dynein-mediated stripping of corona cargoes through a direct interaction with Nde1. This antagonistic activity is crucial for maintaining the required corona composition and ensuring efficient kinetochore biorientation.	CENP-F stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments and limits dynein stripping of corona cargoes.	The Journal of cell biology
32289147	Centrosome disjunction occurs in late G2 to facilitate bipolar spindle formation and is mediated by the NIMA-related kinase Nek2. Here, we show that GAS2L1, a microtubule- and F-actin-binding protein required for centrosome disjunction, undergoes Nek2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser352 in G2/M. The phosphorylation is essential for centrosome disjunction in late G2 and for proper spindle assembly and faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis. GAS2L1 contains a calponin-homology (CH) domain and a GAS2-related (GAR) domain, which bind to F-actin and microtubules, respectively. Notably, the CH and GAR domains bind to each other to inhibit the functions of both domains, and Ser352 phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between the two domains and relieves the autoinhibition. We dissected the roles of the GAS2L1 phosphorylation and of centrosome-linker disassembly, which is another Nek2-mediated event, and found that these events together trigger centrosome disjunction. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the concerted Nek2 actions that split the centrosomes in late G2.	Nek2-mediated GAS2L1 phosphorylation and centrosome-linker disassembly induce centrosome disjunction.	The Journal of cell biology
32303746	The yeast phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) decarboxylase Psd2 is proposed to engage in a membrane contact site (MCS) for PtdSer decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). This proposed MCS harbors Psd2, the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) Sfh4, the Stt4 phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-OH kinase, the Scs2 tether, and an uncharacterized protein. We report that, of these components, only Sfh4 and Stt4 regulate Psd2 activity in vivo. They do so via distinct mechanisms. Sfh4 operates via a mechanism for which its PtdIns-transfer activity is dispensable but requires an Sfh4-Psd2 physical interaction. The other requires Stt4-mediated production of PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), where Stt4 (along with the Sac1 PtdIns4P phosphatase and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane tethers) indirectly modulate Psd2 activity via a PtdIns4P homeostatic mechanism that influences PtdSer accessibility to Psd2. These results identify an example in which the biological function of a Sec14-like PITP is cleanly uncoupled from its canonical in vitro PtdIns-transfer activity and challenge popular functional assumptions regarding lipid-transfer protein involvements in MCS function.

32344433	In addition to the classical pathway of secretion, some transmembrane proteins reach the plasma membrane through alternative routes. Several proteins transit through endosomes and are exported in a Rab8-, Rab10-, and/or Rab11-dependent manner. GRAFs are membrane-binding proteins associated with tubules and vesicles. We found extensive colocalization of GRAF1b/2 with Rab8a/b and partial with Rab10. We identified MICAL1 and WDR44 as direct GRAF-binding partners. MICAL1 links GRAF1b/2 to Rab8a/b and Rab10, and WDR44 binds Rab11. Endogenous WDR44 labels a subset of tubular endosomes, which are closely aligned with the ER via binding to VAPA/B. With its BAR domain, GRAF2 can tubulate membranes, and in its absence WDR44 tubules are not observed. We show that GRAF2 and WDR44 are essential for the export of neosynthesized E-cadherin, MMP14, and CFTR DeltaF508, three proteins whose exocytosis is sensitive to ER stress. Overexpression of dominant negative mutants of GRAF1/2, WDR44, and MICAL1 also interferes with it, facilitating future studies of Rab8/10/11-dependent exocytic pathways of central importance in biology.	GRAF2, WDR44, and MICAL1 mediate Rab8/10/11-dependent export of E-cadherin, MMP14, and CFTR DeltaF508.	The Journal of cell biology
32236513	How the cell rapidly and completely reorganizes its architecture when it divides is a problem that has fascinated researchers for almost 150 yr. We now know that the core regulatory machinery is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but how these multiple protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases are coordinated in space and time to remodel the cell in a matter of minutes remains a major question. Cyclin B1-Cdk is the primary kinase that drives mitotic remodeling; here we show that it is targeted to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by binding an acidic face of the kinetochore checkpoint protein, MAD1, where it coordinates NPC disassembly with kinetochore assembly. Localized cyclin B1-Cdk1 is needed for the proper release of MAD1 from the embrace of TPR at the nuclear pore so that it can be recruited to kinetochores before nuclear envelope breakdown to maintain genomic stability.	Cyclin B1-Cdk1 facilitates MAD1 release from the nuclear pore to ensure a robust spindle checkpoint.	The Journal of cell biology
32311005	Microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase-like (MASTL) is a mitosis-accelerating kinase with emerging roles in cancer progression. However, possible cell cycle-independent mechanisms behind its oncogenicity remain ambiguous. Here, we identify MASTL as an activator of cell contractility and MRTF-A/SRF (myocardin-related transcription factor A/serum response factor) signaling. Depletion of MASTL increased cell spreading while reducing contractile actin stress fibers in normal and breast cancer cells and strongly impairing breast cancer cell motility and invasion. Transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed MASTL-regulated genes implicated in cell movement and actomyosin contraction, including Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1, ARHGEF2) and MRTF-A target genes tropomyosin 4.2 (TPM4), vinculin (VCL), and nonmuscle myosin IIB (NM-2B, MYH10). Mechanistically, MASTL associated with MRTF-A and increased its nuclear retention and transcriptional activity. Importantly, MASTL kinase activity was not required for regulation of cell spreading or MRTF-A/SRF transcriptional activity. Taken together, we present a previously unknown kinase-independent role for MASTL as a regulator of cell adhesion, contractility, and MRTF-A/SRF activity.	MASTL promotes cell contractility and motility through kinase-independent signaling.	The Journal of cell biology
32412594	The evolutionarily conserved microtubule (MT)-severing AAA-ATPase enzyme Katanin is emerging as a critical regulator of MT dynamics. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Katanin MT-severing activity is essential for meiotic spindle assembly but is toxic for the mitotic spindle. Here we analyzed Katanin dynamics in C. elegans and deciphered the role of Katanin phosphorylation in the regulation of its activity and stability. Katanin is abundant in oocytes, and its levels drop after meiosis, but unexpectedly, a significant fraction is present throughout embryogenesis, where it is dynamically recruited to the centrosomes and chromosomes during mitosis. We show that the minibrain kinase MBK-2, which is activated during meiosis, phosphorylates Katanin at multiple serines. We demonstrate unequivocally that Katanin phosphorylation at a single residue is necessary and sufficient to target Katanin for proteasomal degradation after meiosis, whereas phosphorylation at the other sites only inhibits Katanin ATPase activity stimulated by MTs. Our findings suggest that cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation fine-tune Katanin level and activity to deliver the appropriate MT-severing activity during development.	Phosphorylation of the microtubule-severing AAA+ enzyme Katanin regulates C. elegans embryo development.	The Journal of cell biology
32422653	The TGN is a key compartment for the sorting and secretion of newly synthesized proteins. At the TGN, soluble proteins are sorted based on the instructions carried in their oligosaccharide backbones or by a Ca2+-mediated process that involves the cargo-sorting protein Cab45. Here, we show that Cab45 is phosphorylated by the Golgi-specific protein kinase Fam20C. Mimicking of phosphorylation translocates Cab45 into TGN-derived vesicles, which goes along with an increased export of LyzC, a Cab45 client. Our findings demonstrate that Fam20C plays a key role in the export of Cab45 clients by fine-tuning Cab45 oligomerization and thus impacts Cab45 retention in the TGN.	Fam20C regulates protein secretion by Cab45 phosphorylation.	The Journal of cell biology
32437509	Blockade antibodies of the immunoinhibitory receptor PD-1 can stimulate the anti-tumor activity of T cells, but clinical benefit is limited to a fraction of patients. Evidence suggests that BTLA, a receptor structurally related to PD-1, may contribute to resistance to PD-1 targeted therapy, but how BTLA and PD-1 differ in their mechanisms is debated. Here, we compared the abilities of BTLA and PD-1 to recruit effector molecules and to regulate T cell signaling. While PD-1 selectively recruited SHP2 over the stronger phosphatase SHP1, BTLA preferentially recruited SHP1 to more efficiently suppress T cell signaling. Contrary to the dominant view that PD-1 and BTLA signal exclusively through SHP1/2, we found that in SHP1/2 double-deficient primary T cells, PD-1 and BTLA still potently inhibited cell proliferation and cytokine production, albeit more transiently than in wild type T cells. Thus, PD-1 and BTLA can suppress T cell signaling through a mechanism independent of both SHP1 and SHP2.	PD-1 and BTLA regulate T cell signaling differentially and only partially through SHP1 and SHP2.	The Journal of cell biology
32580209	Mechanisms coupling the atypical PKC (aPKC) kinase activity to its subcellular localization are essential for cell polarization. Unlike other members of the PKC family, aPKC has no well-defined plasma membrane (PM) or calcium binding domains, leading to the assumption that its subcellular localization relies exclusively on protein-protein interactions. Here we show that in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, the pseudosubstrate region (PSr) of aPKC acts as a polybasic domain capable of targeting aPKC to the PM via electrostatic binding to PM PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. However, physical interaction between aPKC and Par-6 is required for the PM-targeting of aPKC, likely by allosterically exposing the PSr to bind PM. Binding of Par-6 also inhibits aPKC kinase activity, and such inhibition can be relieved through Par-6 interaction with apical polarity protein Crumbs. Our data suggest a potential mechanism in which allosteric regulation of polybasic PSr by Par-6 couples the control of both aPKC subcellular localization and spatial activation of its kinase activity.	A polybasic domain in aPKC mediates Par6-dependent control of membrane targeting and kinase activity.	The Journal of cell biology
32421151	Protein kinases direct polarized growth by regulating the cytoskeleton in time and space and could play similar roles in cell division. We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place.	Fission yeast Pak1 phosphorylates anillin-like Mid1 for spatial control of cytokinesis.	The Journal of cell biology
32421152	Rsp5, the Nedd4 family member in yeast, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in numerous cellular processes, many of which require Rsp5 to interact with PY-motif containing adaptor proteins. Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5 adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif. Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1 ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby maintaining cell integrity.

32543652	Rcd4 is a poorly characterized Drosophila centriole component whose mammalian counterpart, PPP1R35, is suggested to function in centriole elongation and conversion to centrosomes. Here, we show that rcd4 mutants exhibit fewer centrioles, aberrant mitoses, and reduced basal bodies in sensory organs. Rcd4 interacts with the C-terminal part of Ana3, which loads onto the procentriole during interphase, ahead of Rcd4 and before mitosis. Accordingly, depletion of Ana3 prevents Rcd4 recruitment but not vice versa. We find that neither Ana3 nor Rcd4 participates directly in the mitotic conversion of centrioles to centrosomes, but both are required to load Ana1, which is essential for such conversion. Whereas ana3 mutants are male sterile, reflecting a requirement for Ana3 for centriole development in the male germ line, rcd4 mutants are fertile and have male germ line centrioles of normal length. Thus, Rcd4 is essential in somatic cells but is not absolutely required in spermatogenesis, indicating tissue-specific roles in centriole and basal body formation.

32673398	In mammals, argonaute (AGO) proteins have been characterized for their roles in small RNA-mediated posttranscriptional and also in transcriptional gene silencing. Here, we report a different role for AGO1 in estradiol-triggered transcriptional activation in human cells. We show that in MCF-7 mammary gland cells, AGO1 associates with transcriptional enhancers of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and that this association is up-regulated by treating the cells with estrogen (E2), displaying a positive correlation with the activation of these enhancers. Moreover, we show that AGO1 interacts with ERalpha and that this interaction is also increased by E2 treatment, but occurs in the absence of RNA. We show that AGO1 acts positively as a coactivator in estradiol-triggered transcription regulation by promoting ERalpha binding to its enhancers. Consistently, AGO1 depletion decreases long-range contacts between ERalpha enhancers and their target promoters. Our results point to a role of AGO1 in transcriptional regulation in human cells that is independent from small RNA binding.

32678881	Excessive accumulation of collagen leads to fibrosis. Integrin alpha1beta1 (Itgalpha1beta1) prevents kidney fibrosis by reducing collagen production through inhibition of the EGF receptor (EGFR) that phosphorylates cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. To elucidate how the Itgalpha1beta1/EGFR axis controls collagen synthesis, we analyzed the levels of nuclear tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in WT and Itgalpha1-null kidney cells. We show that the phosphorylation of the RNA-DNA binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is higher in Itgalpha1-null cells. FUS contains EGFR-targeted phosphorylation sites and, in Itgalpha1-null cells, activated EGFR promotes FUS phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Nuclear FUS binds to the collagen IV promoter, commencing gene transcription that is reduced by inhibiting EGFR, down-regulating FUS, or expressing FUS mutated in the EGFR-targeted phosphorylation sites. Finally, a cell-penetrating peptide that inhibits FUS nuclear translocation reduces FUS nuclear content and collagen IV transcription. Thus, EGFR-mediated FUS phosphorylation regulates FUS nuclear translocation and transcription of a major profibrotic collagen gene. Targeting FUS nuclear translocation offers a new antifibrotic therapy.	EGF receptor-mediated FUS phosphorylation promotes its nuclear translocation and fibrotic signaling.

32673396	The tumor suppressor PTEN is essential for early development. Its lipid phosphatase activity converts PIP3 to PIP2 and antagonizes the PI3K-Akt pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that PTEN's protein phosphatase activity is required for epiblast epithelial differentiation and polarization. This is accomplished by reconstitution of PTEN-null embryoid bodies with PTEN mutants that lack only PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity or both PTEN's lipid and protein phosphatase activities. Phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify Abi1, a core component of the WASP-family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), as a new PTEN substrate. We demonstrate that PTEN dephosphorylation of Abi1 at Y213 and S216 results in Abi1 degradation through the calpain pathway. This leads to down-regulation of the WRC and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The latter is critical to the transformation of nonpolar pluripotent stem cells into the polarized epiblast epithelium. Our findings establish a link between PTEN and WAVE-Arp2/3-regulated actin cytoskeletal dynamics in epithelial morphogenesis.	PTEN dephosphorylates Abi1 to promote epithelial morphogenesis.

32673397	Tumor cells exposed to a physiological matrix of type I collagen fibers form elongated collagenolytic invadopodia, which differ from dotty-like invadopodia forming on the gelatin substratum model. The related scaffold proteins, TKS5 and TKS4, are key components of the mechanism of invadopodia assembly. The molecular events through which TKS proteins direct collagenolytic invadopodia formation are poorly defined. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, identification of bound proteins by mass spectrometry, and in vitro pull-down experiments, we found an interaction between TKS5 and FGD1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho-GTPase CDC42, which is known for its role in the assembly of invadopodial actin core structure. A novel cell polarity network is uncovered comprising TKS5, FGD1, and CDC42, directing invadopodia formation and the polarization of MT1-MMP recycling compartments, required for invadopodia activity and invasion in a 3D collagen matrix. Additionally, our data unveil distinct signaling pathways involved in collagenolytic invadopodia formation downstream of TKS4 or TKS5 in breast cancer cells.

32706374	"Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that organize synapses by binding to diverse trans-synaptic ligands, but how neurexins are regulated is incompletely understood. Here we identify FAM19A/TAFA proteins, ""orphan"" cytokines, as neurexin regulators that interact with all neurexins, except for neurexin-1gamma, via an unusual mechanism. Specifically, we show that FAM19A1-A4 bind to the cysteine-loop domain of neurexins by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds during transport through the secretory pathway. FAM19A-binding required both the cysteines of the cysteine-loop domain and an adjacent sequence of neurexins. Genetic deletion of neurexins suppressed FAM19A1 expression, demonstrating that FAM19As physiologically interact with neurexins. In hippocampal cultures, expression of exogenous FAM19A1 decreased neurexin O-glycosylation and suppressed its heparan sulfate modification, suggesting that FAM19As regulate the post-translational modification of neurexins. Given the selective expression of FAM19As in specific subtypes of neurons and their activity-dependent regulation, these results suggest that FAM19As serve as cell type-specific regulators of neurexin modifications."

32876692	NUCKS1 (nuclear ubiquitous casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1) is a chromatin-associated, vertebrate-specific, and multifunctional protein with a role in DNA damage signaling and repair. Previously, we have shown that NUCKS1 helps maintain homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair in human cells and functions as a tumor suppressor in mice. However, the mechanisms by which NUCKS1 positively impacts these processes had remained unclear. Here, we show that NUCKS1 physically and functionally interacts with the DNA motor protein RAD54. Upon exposure of human cells to DNA-damaging agents, NUCKS1 controls the resolution of RAD54 foci. In unperturbed cells, NUCKS1 prevents RAD54's inappropriate engagement with RAD51AP1. In vitro, NUCKS1 stimulates the ATPase activity of RAD54 and the RAD51-RAD54-mediated strand invasion step during displacement loop formation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the NUCKS1 protein is an important new regulator of the spatiotemporal events in HR.	NUCKS1 promotes RAD54 activity in homologous recombination DNA repair.

32915949	The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular hub of lipid metabolism, coordinating lipid synthesis with continuous changes in metabolic flux. Maintaining ER lipid homeostasis despite these fluctuations is crucial to cell function and viability. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that is crucial for normal ER lipid metabolism and protects the ER from dysfunction. We identify the molecular function of the evolutionarily conserved ER protein FIT2 as a fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) diphosphatase that hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl 4'-phosphopantetheine. This activity of FIT2, which is predicted to be active in the ER lumen, is required in yeast and mammalian cells for maintaining ER structure, protecting against ER stress, and enabling normal lipid storage in lipid droplets. Our findings thus solve the long-standing mystery of the molecular function of FIT2 and highlight the maintenance of optimal fatty acyl-CoA levels as key to ER homeostasis.	FIT2 is an acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase crucial for endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis.	The Journal of cell biology
32997737	Polo-like kinases (PLKs) play widely conserved roles in orchestrating meiotic chromosome dynamics. However, how PLKs are targeted to distinct subcellular localizations during meiotic progression remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-1 primes the recruitment of PLK-2 to the synaptonemal complex (SC) through phosphorylation of SYP-1 in C. elegans. SYP-1 phosphorylation by CDK-1 occurs just before meiotic onset. However, PLK-2 docking to the SC is prevented by the nucleoplasmic HAL-2/3 complex until crossover designation, which constrains PLK-2 to special chromosomal regions known as pairing centers to ensure proper homologue pairing and synapsis. PLK-2 is targeted to crossover sites primed by CDK-1 and spreads along the SC by reinforcing SYP-1 phosphorylation on one side of each crossover only when threshold levels of crossovers are generated. Thus, the integration of chromosome-autonomous signaling and a nucleus-wide crossover-counting mechanism partitions holocentric chromosomes relative to the crossover site, which ultimately defines the pattern of chromosome segregation during meiosis I.

32960945	Proteins of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family control cell and tissue morphogenesis. We previously reported that moesin, the only ERM in Drosophila, controls mitotic morphogenesis and epithelial integrity. We also found that the Pp1-87B phosphatase dephosphorylates moesin, counteracting its activation by the Ste20-like kinase Slik. To understand how this signaling pathway is itself regulated, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen, looking for new regulators of moesin activity. We identified that Slik is a new member of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex (STRIPAK). We discovered that the phosphatase activity of STRIPAK reduces Slik phosphorylation to promote its cortical association and proper activation of moesin. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of STRIPAK phosphatase activity causes cell morphology defects in mitosis and impairs epithelial tissue integrity. Our results implicate the Slik-STRIPAK complex in the control of multiple morphogenetic processes.	STRIPAK regulates Slik localization to control mitotic morphogenesis and epithelial integrity.

33007084	"In neurons, dendrites form the major sites of information receipt and integration. It is thus vital that, during development, the dendritic arbor is adequately formed to enable proper neural circuit formation and function. While several known processes shape the arbor, little is known of those that govern dendrite branching versus extension. Here, we report a new mechanism instructing dendrites to branch versus extend. In it, glutamate signaling activates mGluR5 receptors to promote Ckd5-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of delta-catenin. The phosphorylation state of this motif determines delta-catenin's ability to bind either Pdlim5 or Magi1. Whereas the delta:Pdlim5 complex enhances dendrite branching at the expense of elongation, the delta:Magi1 complex instead promotes lengthening. Our data suggest that these complexes affect dendrite development by differentially regulating the small-GTPase RhoA and actin-associated protein Cortactin. We thus reveal a ""phospho-switch"" within delta-catenin, subject to a glutamate-mediated signaling pathway, that assists in balancing the branching versus extension of dendrites during neural development."

33090185	Dendrite pathology is frequently observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Although previous studies identified several pathogenic mediators of dendrite defects that act through loss of function in NDs, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, our search for additional pathogenic contributors to dendrite defects in NDs identifies Relish/NF-kappaB as a novel gain-of-toxicity-based mediator of dendrite defects in animal models for polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a Drosophila model for polyQ diseases, polyQ-induced dendrite defects require Dredd/Caspase-8-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of Relish to generate the N-terminal fragment, Rel68, and subsequent Charon-mediated nuclear localization of Rel68. Rel68 alone induced neuronal toxicity causing dendrite and behavioral defects, and we identify two novel transcriptional targets, Tup and Pros, that mediate Rel68-induced neuronal toxicity. Finally, we show that Rel68-induced toxicity also contributes to dendrite and behavioral defects in a Drosophila model for ALS. Collectively, our data propose disinhibition of latent toxicity of Relish/NF-kappaB as a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying dendrite pathology in NDs.	NF-kappaB disinhibition contributes to dendrite defects in fly models of neurodegenerative diseases.	The Journal of cell biology
33258871	Primary cilia function as critical signaling hubs whose absence leads to severe disorders collectively known as ciliopathies; our knowledge of ciliogenesis remains limited. We show that Smo induces ciliogenesis through two distinct yet essential noncanonical Hh pathways in several cell types, including neurons. Surprisingly, ligand activation of Smo induces autophagy via an LKB1-AMPK axis to remove the satellite pool of OFD1. This is required, but not sufficient, for ciliogenesis. Additionally, Smo activates the Galphai-LGN-NuMA-dynein axis, causing accumulation of a portion of OFD1 at centrioles in early ciliogenesis. Both pathways are critical for redistribution of BBS4 from satellites to centrioles, which is also mediated by OFD1 centriolar translocation. Notably, different Smo agonists, which activate Smo distinctly, activate one or the other of these pathways; only in combination they recapitulate the activity of Hh ligand. These studies provide new insight into physiological stimuli (Hh) that activate autophagy and promote ciliogenesis and introduce a novel role for the Galphai-LGN-NuMA-dynein complex in this process.	A non-canonical Hedgehog pathway initiates ciliogenesis and autophagy.	The Journal of cell biology
33355621	During cell division, in response to chromatin bridges, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) delays abscission to prevent chromosome breakage or tetraploidization. Here, we show that inhibition of ATM or Chk2 kinases impairs CPC localization to the midbody center, accelerates midbody resolution in normally segregating cells, and correlates with premature abscission and chromatin breakage in cytokinesis with trapped chromatin. In cultured human cells, ATM activates Chk2 at late midbodies. In turn, Chk2 phosphorylates human INCENP-Ser91 to promote INCENP binding to Mklp2 kinesin and CPC localization to the midbody center through Mklp2 association with Cep55. Expression of truncated Mklp2 that does not bind to Cep55 or nonphosphorylatable INCENP-Ser91A impairs CPC midbody localization and accelerates abscission. In contrast, expression of phosphomimetic INCENP-Ser91D or a chimeric INCENP protein that is targeted to the midbody center rescues the abscission delay in Chk2-deficient or ATM-deficient cells. Furthermore, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is required for ATM activation at the midbody in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges. These results identify an ATM-Chk2-INCENP pathway that imposes the abscission checkpoint by regulating CPC midbody localization.	An ATM-Chk2-INCENP pathway activates the abscission checkpoint.

33411917	Receptor degradation terminates signaling by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Degradation of EGFR occurs in lysosomes and requires the switching of RAB5 for RAB7 on late endosomes to enable their fusion with the lysosome, but what controls this critical switching is poorly understood. We show that the tyrosine kinase FER alters PKCdelta function by phosphorylating it on Y374, and that phospho-Y374-PKCdelta prevents RAB5 release from nascent late endosomes, thereby inhibiting EGFR degradation and promoting the recycling of endosomal EGFR to the cell surface. The rapid association of phospho-Y374-PKCdelta with EGFR-containing endosomes is diminished by PTPN14, which dephosphorylates phospho-Y374-PKCdelta. In triple-negative breast cancer cells, the FER-dependent phosphorylation of PKCdelta enhances EGFR signaling and promotes anchorage-independent cell growth. Importantly, increased Y374-PKCdelta phosphorylation correlating with arrested late endosome maturation was identified in approximately 25% of triple-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to their pathology.	Phosphorylation of PKCdelta by FER tips the balance from EGFR degradation to recycling.	The Journal of cell biology
33443570	Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer. We now demonstrate that loss of function of the endosomal GTPase Rab35 in human brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increases glioblastoma growth and decreases animal survival following BTIC implantation in mouse brains. Mechanistically, we identify that the GTPase Arf5 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab35, DENND1/connecdenn, and allosterically enhances its GEF activity toward Rab35. Knockdown of either Rab35 or Arf5 increases cell migration, invasiveness, and self-renewal in culture and enhances the growth and invasiveness of BTIC-initiated brain tumors in mice. RNAseq of the tumors reveals up-regulation of the tumor-promoting transcription factor SPOCD1, and disruption of the Arf5/Rab35 axis in glioblastoma cells leads to strong activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, with resulting enhancement of SPOCD1 levels. These discoveries reveal an unexpected cascade between an Arf and a Rab and indicate a role for the cascade, and thus endosomal trafficking, in brain tumors.

33439240	The small noncoding vault RNA (vtRNA) is a component of the vault complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex found in most eukaryotes. Emerging evidence suggests that vtRNAs may be involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions when unassociated with the vault complex. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for vtRNA in synaptogenesis. Using an in vitro synapse formation model, we show that murine vtRNA (mvtRNA) promotes synapse formation by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway. mvtRNA is transported to the distal region of neurites as part of the vault complex. Interestingly, mvtRNA is released from the vault complex in the neurite by a mitotic kinase Aurora-A-dependent phosphorylation of MVP, a major protein component of the vault complex. mvtRNA binds to and activates MEK1 and thereby enhances MEK1-mediated ERK activation in neurites. These results suggest the existence of a regulatory mechanism of the MAPK signaling pathway by vtRNAs as a new molecular basis for synapse formation.

33373452	Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for embryonic development and adult homeostasis. How its signaling activity is fine-tuned in response to fluctuated Hh gradient is less known. Here, we identify protein phosphatase V (PpV), the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6, as a homeostatic regulator of Hh signaling. PpV is genetically upstream of widerborst (wdb), which encodes a regulatory subunit of PP2A that modulates high-level Hh signaling. We show that PpV negatively regulates Wdb stability independent of phosphatase activity of PpV, by competing with the catalytic subunit of PP2A for Wdb association, leading to Wdb ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, regulated Wdb stability, maintained through competition between two closely related phosphatases, ensures graded Hh signaling. Interestingly, PpV expression is regulated by Hh signaling. Therefore, PpV functions as a Hh activity sensor that regulates Wdb-mediated PP2A activity through feedback mechanisms to maintain Hh signaling homeostasis.	Competition between two phosphatases fine-tunes Hedgehog signaling.	The Journal of cell biology
33566094	The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is mainly localized to the vacuolar membrane and regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to nutrient availability. To obtain deeper insights into the functional roles of TORC1, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the TORC1 interactome in yeast using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. We found that while most of the BiFC signals are observed at the vacuolar membrane, a fraction of them are detected at cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules. Moreover, mRNA-binding proteins are enriched in the TORC1 interactome, suggesting a functional relationship between TORC1 and mRNA metabolism. We show that a portion of TORC1 is consistently associated with mRNP complexes and interacts with a specific subset of mRNAs. We also demonstrate that TORC1 directly targets a translational repressor Scd6 and that the activity of Scd6 is inhibited by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation. Collectively, our data suggest that TORC1 plays a novel role in posttranscriptional regulation by controlling the activity of Scd6.	Analysis of the TORC1 interactome reveals a spatially distinct function of TORC1 in mRNP complexes.	The Journal of cell biology
33605979	Endocytosed proteins can be delivered to lysosomes for degradation or recycled to either the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane. It remains poorly understood how the recycling versus degradation of cargoes is determined. Here, we show that multiple extracellular stimuli, including starvation, LPS, IL-6, and EGF treatment, can strongly inhibit endocytic recycling of multiple cargoes through the activation of MAPK11/14. The stress-induced kinases in turn directly phosphorylate SNX27, a key regulator of endocytic recycling, at serine 51 (Ser51). Phosphorylation of SNX27 at Ser51 alters the conformation of its cargo-binding pocket and decreases the interaction between SNX27 and cargo proteins, thereby inhibiting endocytic recycling. Our study indicates that endocytic recycling is highly dynamic and can crosstalk with cellular stress-signaling pathways. Suppression of endocytic recycling and enhancement of receptor lysosomal degradation serve as new mechanisms for cells to cope with stress and save energy.	Phosphorylation of SNX27 by MAPK11/14 links cellular stress-signaling pathways with endocytic recycling.	The Journal of cell biology
33819340	Tight regulation of the APC/C-Cdc20 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B1 for degradation is important for mitotic fidelity. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inhibits Cdc20 through the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In addition, phosphorylation of Cdc20 by cyclin B1-Cdk1 independently inhibits APC/C-Cdc20 activation. This creates a conundrum for how Cdc20 is activated before cyclin B1 degradation. Here, we show that the MCC component BubR1 harbors both Cdc20 inhibition and activation activities, allowing for cross-talk between the two Cdc20 inhibition pathways. Specifically, BubR1 acts as a substrate specifier for PP2A-B56 to enable efficient Cdc20 dephosphorylation in the MCC. A mutant Cdc20 mimicking the dephosphorylated state escapes a mitotic checkpoint arrest, arguing that restricting Cdc20 dephosphorylation to the MCC is important. Collectively, our work reveals how Cdc20 can be dephosphorylated in the presence of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity without causing premature anaphase onset.

33666644	A hallmark of aging is immunosenescence, a decline in immune functions, which appeared to be inevitable in living organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that genetic inhibition of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor drastically enhances immunocompetence in old age in C. elegans. We demonstrate that longevity-promoting DAF-16/FOXO and heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) increase immunocompetence in old daf-2(-) animals. In contrast, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (PMK-1), a key determinant of immunity, is only partially required for this rejuvenated immunity. The up-regulation of DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 decreases the expression of the zip-10/bZIP transcription factor, which in turn down-regulates INS-7, an agonistic insulin-like peptide, resulting in further reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). Thus, reduced IIS prevents immune aging via the up-regulation of anti-aging transcription factors that modulate an endocrine insulin-like peptide through a feedforward mechanism. Because many functions of IIS are conserved across phyla, our study may lead to the development of strategies against immune aging in humans.	Reduced insulin/IGF1 signaling prevents immune aging via ZIP-10/bZIP-mediated feedforward loop.	The Journal of cell biology
33861319	Lipid droplets (LDs) are critical for lipid storage and energy metabolism. LDs form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the molecular basis for LD biogenesis remains elusive. Here, we show that fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) interacts with ER tubule-forming proteins Rtn4 and REEP5. The association is mainly transmembrane domain based and stimulated by oleic acid. Depletion of ER tubule-forming proteins decreases the number and size of LDs in cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, mimicking loss of FIT2. Through cytosolic loops, FIT2 binds to cytoskeletal protein septin 7, an interaction that is also required for normal LD biogenesis. Depletion of ER tubule-forming proteins or septins delays nascent LD formation. In addition, FIT2-interacting proteins are up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation, and ER tubule-forming proteins, septin 7, and FIT2 are transiently enriched at LD formation sites. Thus, FIT2-mediated nascent LD biogenesis is facilitated by ER tubule-forming proteins and septins.	FIT2 organizes lipid droplet biogenesis with ER tubule-forming proteins and septins.

33656555	The polarisome is a cortical proteinaceous microcompartment that organizes the growth of actin filaments and the fusion of secretory vesicles in yeasts and filamentous fungi. Polarisomes are compact, spotlike structures at the growing tips of their respective cells. The molecular forces that control the form and size of this microcompartment are not known. Here we identify a complex between the polarisome subunit Pea2 and the type V Myosin Myo2 that anchors Myo2 at the cortex of yeast cells. We discovered a point mutation in the cargo-binding domain of Myo2 that impairs the interaction with Pea2 and consequently the formation and focused localization of the polarisome. Cells carrying this mutation grow round instead of elongated buds. Further experiments and biophysical modeling suggest that the interactions between polarisome-bound Myo2 motors and dynamic actin filaments spatially focus the polarisome and sustain its compact shape.	Type V myosin focuses the polarisome and shapes the tip of yeast cells.	The Journal of cell biology
33914026	Rac1 GTPase is hyperactivated in tumors and contributes to malignancy. Rac1 disruption of junctions requires its effector PAK1, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that E-cadherin is internalized via micropinocytosis in a PAK1-dependent manner without catenin dissociation and degradation. In addition to internalization, PAK1 regulates E-cadherin transport by fine-tuning Rab small GTPase function. PAK1 phosphorylates a core Rab regulator, RabGDIbeta, but not RabGDIalpha. Phosphorylated RabGDIbeta preferentially associates with Rab5 and Rab11, which is predicted to promote Rab retrieval from membranes. Consistent with this hypothesis, Rab11 is activated by Rac1, and inhibition of Rab11 function partially rescues E-cadherin destabilization. Thus, Rac1 activation reduces surface cadherin levels as a net result of higher bulk flow of membrane uptake that counteracts Rab11-dependent E-cadherin delivery to junctions (recycling and/or exocytosis). This unique small GTPase crosstalk has an impact on Rac1 and PAK1 regulation of membrane remodeling during epithelial dedifferentiation, adhesion, and motility.

33871553	The Golgi complex is essential for the processing, sorting, and trafficking of newly synthesized proteins and lipids. Golgi turnover is regulated to meet different cellular physiological demands. The role of autophagy in the turnover of Golgi, however, has not been clarified. Here we show that CALCOCO1 binds the Golgi-resident palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC17 to facilitate Golgi degradation by autophagy during starvation. Depletion of CALCOCO1 in cells causes expansion of the Golgi and accumulation of its structural and membrane proteins. ZDHHC17 itself is degraded by autophagy together with other Golgi membrane proteins such as TMEM165. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which CALCOCO1 mediates selective Golgiphagy to control Golgi size and morphology in eukaryotic cells via its interaction with ZDHHC17.

33929514	During mitosis, sister chromatids attach to microtubules from opposite poles, called biorientation. Sister chromatid cohesion resists microtubule forces, generating tension, which provides the signal that biorientation has occurred. How tension silences the surveillance pathways that prevent cell cycle progression and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments remains unclear. Here we show that SUMOylation dampens error correction to allow stable sister kinetochore biorientation and timely anaphase onset. The Siz1/Siz2 SUMO ligases modify the pericentromere-localized shugoshin (Sgo1) protein before its tension-dependent release from chromatin. Sgo1 SUMOylation reduces its binding to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and weakening of this interaction is important for stable biorientation. Unstable biorientation in SUMO-deficient cells is associated with persistence of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres, and SUMOylation of CPC subunit Bir1 also contributes to timely anaphase onset. We propose that SUMOylation acts in a combinatorial manner to facilitate dismantling of the error correction machinery within pericentromeres and thereby sharpen the metaphase-anaphase transition.	SUMOylation stabilizes sister kinetochore biorientation to allow timely anaphase.	The Journal of cell biology
33999101	Rab40b is a SOCS box-containing protein that regulates the secretion of MMPs to facilitate extracellular matrix remodeling during cell migration. Here, we show that Rab40b interacts with Cullin5 via the Rab40b SOCS domain. We demonstrate that loss of Rab40b-Cullin5 binding decreases cell motility and invasive potential and show that defective cell migration and invasion stem from alteration to the actin cytoskeleton, leading to decreased invadopodia formation, decreased actin dynamics at the leading edge, and an increase in stress fibers. We also show that these stress fibers anchor at less dynamic, more stable focal adhesions. Mechanistically, changes in the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion dynamics are mediated in part by EPLIN, which we demonstrate to be a binding partner of Rab40b and a target for Rab40b-Cullin5-dependent localized ubiquitylation and degradation. Thus, we propose a model where Rab40b-Cullin5-dependent ubiquitylation regulates EPLIN localization to promote cell migration and invasion by altering focal adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics.	Rab40-Cullin5 complex regulates EPLIN and actin cytoskeleton dynamics during cell migration.	The Journal of cell biology
33978709	The ER tethers tightly to mitochondria and the mitochondrial protein FUNDC1 recruits Drp1 to ER-mitochondria contact sites, subsequently facilitating mitochondrial fission and preventing mitochondria from undergoing hypoxic stress. However, the mechanisms by which the ER modulates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission are poorly understood. Here, we show that USP19, an ER-resident deubiquitinase, accumulates at ER-mitochondria contact sites under hypoxia and promotes hypoxia-induced mitochondrial division. In response to hypoxia, USP19 binds to and deubiquitinates FUNDC1 at ER-mitochondria contact sites, which facilitates Drp1 oligomerization and Drp1 GTP-binding and hydrolysis activities, thereby promoting mitochondrial division. Our findings reveal a unique hypoxia response pathway mediated by an ER protein that regulates mitochondrial dynamics.

34009269	Circadian rhythms regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, but circadian control of tissue regeneration remains elusive at the molecular level. Here, we show that proper myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration are regulated by the circadian master regulators Per1 and Per2. Depletion of Per1 or Per2 suppressed myoblast differentiation in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo, demonstrating their nonredundant functions. Both Per1 and Per2 were required for the activation of Igf2, an autocrine promoter of myoblast differentiation, accompanied by Per-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II, dynamic histone modifications at the Igf2 promoter and enhancer, and the promoter-enhancer interaction. This circadian epigenetic priming created a preferred time window for initiating myoblast differentiation. Consistently, muscle regeneration was faster if initiated at night, when Per1, Per2, and Igf2 were highly expressed compared with morning.

34259806	ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts are proposed to be held together by distinct families of tethering proteins, which in yeast include the VAP homologues Scs2/22, the extended-synaptotagmin homologues Tcb1/2/3, and the TMEM16 homologue Ist2. It is unclear whether these tethers act redundantly or whether individual tethers have specific functions at contacts. Here, we show that Ist2 directly recruits the phosphatidylserine (PS) transport proteins and ORP family members Osh6 and Osh7 to ER-PM contacts through a binding site located in Ist2's disordered C-terminal tethering region. This interaction is required for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) production by the PS decarboxylase Psd2, whereby PS transported from the ER to the PM by Osh6/7 is endocytosed to the site of Psd2 in endosomes/Golgi/vacuoles. This role for Ist2 and Osh6/7 in nonvesicular PS transport is specific, as other tethers/transport proteins do not compensate. Thus, we identify a molecular link between the ORP and TMEM16 families and a role for endocytosis of PS in PE synthesis.	Ist2 recruits the lipid transporters Osh6/7 to ER-PM contacts to maintain phospholipid metabolism.	The Journal of cell biology
34161574	The Hedgehog pathway, critical to vertebrate development, is organized in primary cilia. Activation of signaling causes the Hedgehog receptor Ptch1 to exit cilia, allowing a second receptor, Smo, to accumulate in cilia and activate the downstream steps of the pathway. Mechanisms regulating the dynamics of these receptors are unknown, but the ubiquitination of Smo regulates its interaction with the intraflagellar transport system to control ciliary levels. A focused screen of ubiquitin-related genes identified nine required for maintaining low ciliary Smo at the basal state. These included cytoplasmic E3s (Arih2, Mgrn1, and Maea), a ciliary localized E3 (Wwp1), a ciliary localized E2 (Ube2l3), a deubiquitinase (Bap1), and three adaptors (Kctd5, Skp1a, and Skp2). The ciliary E3, Wwp1, binds Ptch1 and localizes to cilia at the basal state. Activation of signaling removes both Ptch1 and Wwp1 from cilia, thus providing an elegant mechanism for Ptch1 to regulate ciliary Smo levels.	E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp1 regulates ciliary dynamics of the Hedgehog receptor Smoothened.	The Journal of cell biology
34287648	Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer, with a median survival of approximately 15 mo. Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) at the origin of tumor formation and relapse may prove beneficial. In situ, GSCs are nested within the vascular bed in tight interaction with brain endothelial cells, which positively control their expansion. Because GSCs are notably addicted to apelin (APLN), sourced from the surrounding endothelial stroma, the APLN/APLNR nexus has emerged as a druggable network. However, how this signaling axis operates in gliomagenesis remains underestimated. Here, we find that the glycoprotein GP130 interacts with APLNR at the plasma membrane of GSCs and arbitrates its availability at the surface via ELMOD1, which may further impact on ARF-mediated endovesicular trafficking. From a functional standpoint, interfering with GP130 thwarts APLNR-mediated self-renewal of GSCs ex vivo. Thus, GP130 emerges as an unexpected cicerone to the G protein-coupled APLN receptor, opening new therapeutic perspectives toward the targeting of cancer stem cells.	The glycoprotein GP130 governs the surface presentation of the G protein-coupled receptor APLNR.	The Journal of cell biology
34342639	Mitochondrial movement and distribution are fundamental to their function. Here we report a mechanism that regulates mitochondrial movement by anchoring mitochondria to the F-actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism is activated by an increase in glucose influx and the consequent O-GlcNAcylation of TRAK (Milton), a component of the mitochondrial motor-adaptor complex. The protein four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) serves as the anchor. FHL2 associates with O-GlcNAcylated TRAK and is both necessary and sufficient to drive the accumulation of F-actin around mitochondria and to arrest mitochondrial movement by anchoring to F-actin. Disruption of F-actin restores mitochondrial movement that had been arrested by either TRAK O-GlcNAcylation or forced direction of FHL2 to mitochondria. This pathway for mitochondrial immobilization is present in both neurons and non-neuronal cells and can thereby adapt mitochondrial dynamics to changes in glucose availability.	FHL2 anchors mitochondria to actin and adapts mitochondrial dynamics to glucose supply.	The Journal of cell biology
32747445	Progranulin (PGRN) is an autocrine growth factor that exerts crucial roles within cartilage tissue; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying PGRN-mediated cartilage homeostasis remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of PGRN in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for managing osteoarthritis (OA). We found that PGRN levels are significantly increased in human cartilage in mild OA and that its expression is decreased in the cartilage in severe OA. In vitro, treatment of primary rat chondrocytes with recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1) and aggrecan, and attenuated TNFalpha-induced up-regulation of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. These effects were abrogated in SIRT1(-/-) cells, indicating a causative role of SIRT1 in the effects of PGRN on protein expression in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and activity, which reduced the acetylation levels of SRY-box transcription factor (SOX9) and transcription factor P65 (P65) and thereby promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 and inhibited TNFalpha-induced P65 nuclear accumulation to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism of action for PGRN that maintains cartilage homeostasis and supports the notion that PGRN up-regulation may be a promising strategy for managing OA.	Progranulin modulates cartilage-specific gene expression via sirtuin 1-mediated deacetylation of the transcription factors SOX9 and P65.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32759168	Astrocytes perform multiple essential functions in the developing and mature brain, including regulation of synapse formation, control of neurotransmitter release and uptake, and maintenance of extracellular ion balance. As a result, astrocytes have been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Despite these critical functions, the study of human astrocytes can be difficult because standard differentiation protocols are time-consuming and technically challenging, but a differentiation protocol recently developed in our laboratory enables the efficient derivation of astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells. We used this protocol along with microarrays, luciferase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and ChIP assays to explore the genes involved in astrocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) is critical for astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 overexpression induced early differentiation of astrocytes, and its knockdown blocked astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 overexpression also increased and PITX1 knockdown decreased expression of sex-determining region Y box 9 (SOX9), known initiator of gliogenesis, during early astrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we determined that PITX1 activates the SOX9 promoter through a unique binding motif. Taken together, these findings indicate that PITX1 drives astrocyte differentiation by sustaining activation of the SOX9 promoter.	The transcription factor PITX1 drives astrocyte differentiation by regulating the SOX9 gene.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32737196	The evolutionarily conserved multiprotein Mediator complex (MED) serves as an interface between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) and the RNA Pol II machinery. It has been proposed that each TF interacts with a dedicated MED subunit to induce specific transcriptional responses. But are these binary partnerships sufficient to mediate TF functions? We have previously established that the Med1 Mediator subunit serves as a cofactor of GATA TFs in Drosophila, as shown in mammals. Here, we observe mutant phenotype similarities between another subunit, Med19, and the Drosophila GATA TF Pannier (Pnr), suggesting functional interaction. We further show that Med19 physically interacts with the Drosophila GATA TFs, Pnr and Serpent (Srp), in vivo and in vitro through their conserved C-zinc finger domains. Moreover, Med19 loss of function experiments in vivo or in cellulo indicate that it is required for Pnr- and Srp-dependent gene expression, suggesting general GATA cofactor functions. Interestingly, Med19 but not Med1 is critical for the regulation of all tested GATA target genes, implying shared or differential use of MED subunits by GATAs depending on the target gene. Lastly, we show a direct interaction between Med19 and Med1 by GST pulldown experiments indicating privileged contacts between these two subunits of the MED middle module. Together, these findings identify Med19/Med1 as a composite GATA TF interface and suggest that binary MED subunit-TF partnerships are probably oversimplified models. We propose several mechanisms to account for the transcriptional regulation of GATA-targeted genes.	Mediator complex subunit Med19 binds directly GATA transcription factors and is required with Med1 for GATA-driven gene regulation in vivo.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32709750	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in the coevolution of breast tumor cells and their microenvironment by modifying cellular compartments and regulating cancer cell functions via stromal-epithelial dialogue. However, the relationship and interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is still poorly understood. Herein, we revealed that breast cancer cells have a stronger ability to activate fibroblasts and transform them into myofibroblasts (CAF-like) than normal breast epithelial cells, and this stronger ability occurs through paracrine signaling. In turn, myofibroblasts promote the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells. Detailed regulatory mechanisms showed that, compared with normal cells, Survivin is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, which are then internalized by fibroblasts. Breast cancer cell-derived survivin up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts and then converts them into myofibroblasts, conversely inducing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo Thus, our results indicate that survivin acts as an activator of the tumor microenvironment and that SOD1 up-regulation in fibroblasts can promote breast cancer progression. These results suggest that targeting survivin and SOD1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.	Survivin in breast cancer-derived exosomes activates fibroblasts by up-regulating SOD1, whose feedback promotes cancer proliferation and metastasis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32763975	Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosome instability syndrome of children caused by inherited mutations in one of FA genes, which together constitute a DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, or the FA pathway. Monoubiquitination of Fanconi anemia group D2 protein (FANCD2) by the multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase, the FA core complex, is an obligate step in activation of the FA pathway, and its activity needs to be tightly regulated. FAAP20 is a key structural component of the FA core complex, and regulated proteolysis of FAAP20 mediated by prolyl cis-trans isomerization and phosphorylation at a consensus phosphodegron motif is essential for preserving the integrity of the FA core complex, and thus FANCD2 monoubiquitination. However, how ubiquitin-dependent FAAP20 degradation is modulated to fine-tune FA pathway activation remains largely un-known. Here, we present evidence that FAAP20 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP on lysine 152, the key residue that when polyubiquitinated results in the degradation of FAAP20. Acetylation or mutation of the lysine residue stabilizes FAAP20 by preventing its ubiquitination, thereby protecting it from proteasome-dependent FAAP20 degradation. Consequently, disruption of the FAAP20 acetylation pathway impairs FANCD2 activation. Together, our study reveals a competition mechanism between ubiquitination and acetylation of a common lysine residue that controls FAAP20 stability and highlights a complex balancing between different posttranslational modifications as a way to refine the FA pathway signaling required for DNA ICL repair and genome stability.	Acetylation modulates the Fanconi anemia pathway by protecting FAAP20 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32737199	Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling plays an important role in regulating tumor malignancy, including in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The major biological responses of TGFbeta signaling are determined by the effector proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3. However, the regulators of TGFbeta-SMAD signaling are not completely revealed yet. Here, we showed that the scaffolding protein PDLIM5 (PDZ and LIM domain protein 5, ENH) critically promotes TGFbeta signaling by maintaining SMAD3 stability in NSCLC. First, PDLIM5 was highly expressed in NSCLC compared with that in adjacent normal tissues, and high PDLIM5 expression was associated with poor outcome. Knockdown of PDLIM5 in NSCLC cells decreased migration and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo In addition, TGFbeta signaling and TGFbeta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was repressed by PDLIM5 knockdown. Mechanistically, PDLIM5 knockdown resulted in a reduction of SMAD3 protein levels. Overexpression of SMAD3 reversed the TGFbeta-signaling-repressing and anti-migration effects induced by PDLIM5 knockdown. Notably, PDLIM5 interacted with SMAD3 but not SMAD2 and competitively suppressed the interaction between SMAD3 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1. Therefore, PDLIM5 protected SMAD3 from STUB1-mediated proteasome degradation. STUB1 knockdown restored SMAD3 protein levels, cell migration, and invasion in PDLIM5-knockdown cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that PDLIM5 is a novel regulator of basal SMAD3 stability, with implications for controlling TGFbeta signaling and NSCLC progression.	PDLIM5 inhibits STUB1-mediated degradation of SMAD3 and promotes the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32690611	Transcriptional repressor zinc finger and BTB domain containing 1 (ZBTB1) is required for DNA repair. Because DNA repair defects often underlie genome instability and tumorigenesis, we determined to study the role of ZBTB1 in cancer. In this study, we found that ZBTB1 is down-regulated in breast cancer and this down-regulation is associated with poor outcome of breast cancer patients. ZBTB1 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen have been widely used in the treatment of these patients. Unfortunately, many patients develop resistance to endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen-resistant cancer cells often exhibit higher HER2 expression and an increase of glycolysis. Our data revealed that ZBTB1 plays a critical role in tamoxifen resistance in vitro and in vivo To see if ZBTB1 regulates HER2 expression, we tested the recruitments of ZBTB1 on HER2 regulatory sequences. We observed that over-expressed ZBTB1 occupies the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-binding site of the HER2 intron in tamoxifen-resistant cells, suppressing tamoxifen-induced transcription. In an effort to identify potential microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating ZBTB1, we found that miR-23b-3p directly targets ZBTB1. MiR-23b-3p regulates HER2 expression and tamoxifen resistance via targeting ZBTB1. Finally, we found that miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 regulates aerobic glycolysis in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Together, our data demonstrate that ZBTB1 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells and that targeting the miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.

32796034	T-cell activation is a critical part of the adaptive immune system, enabling responses to foreign cells and external stimulus. In this process, T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) activation stimulates translocation of the downstream kinase PKCtheta to the membrane, leading to NF-kappaB activation and thus transcription of relevant genes. However, the details of how PKCtheta is recruited to the membrane remain enigmatic. It is known that annexin A5 (ANXA5), a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein, has been reported to mediate PKCdelta activation by interaction with PKCdelta, a homologue of PKCtheta, which implicates a potential role of ANXA5 involved in PKCtheta signaling. Here we demonstrate that ANXA5 does play a critical role in the recruitment of PKCtheta to the membrane during T-cell activation. ANXA5 knockout in Jurkat T cells substantially inhibited the membrane translocation of PKCtheta upon TCR engagement and blocked the recruitment of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome, which provides a platform for the catalytic activation of IKKs and subsequent activation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling in activated T cells. As a result, NF-kappaB activation was impaired in ANXA5-KO T cells. T-cell activation was also suppressed by ANAX5 knockdown in primary T cells. These results demonstrated a novel role of ANXA5 in PKC translocation and PKC signaling during T-cell activation.	Annexin A5 is essential for PKCtheta translocation during T-cell activation.

32796032	Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is a cytosolic antibody receptor that targets the internalized virus-antibody complex to the proteasome for degradation. However, the precise mechanism regulating TRIM21 activity is unknown. Here we show that TRIM21 is a substrate of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and that its function is regulated by acetylation. HDAC6 interacts with TRIM21 through its PRYSPRY motif and deacetylates TRIM21 at lysine 385 and lysine 387, thus promoting its homodimerization. Inhibiting HDAC6 activity increases TRIM21 acetylation, and hyperacetylation blocks TRIM21 dimerization and ubiquitination, preventing its binding to the virus-antibody complex and its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HDAC6 depletion or inhibition increases virus accumulation in cells, indicative of an impaired capacity for antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization of viruses, whereas TRIM21 acetylation-deficient K385/387R mutant rescues HDAC6 depletion-caused ADIN impairment. These findings provide evidence for HDAC6 as a novel regulator of TRIM21-mediated intracellular innate immunity.	HDAC6 regulates antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization of viruses via deacetylation of TRIM21.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32796029	Surface-exposed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2 and TLR4 survey the extracellular environment for pathogens. TLR activation initiates the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I). Downstream of TLR4, IFNbeta secretion is only vigorously triggered in macrophages when the receptor undergoes endocytosis and switches signaling adaptor; surface TLR4 engagement predominantly induces proinflammatory cytokines via the signaling adaptor MyD88. It is unclear whether this dichotomy is generally applicable to other TLRs, cell types, or differentiation states. Here, we report that diverse TLR2 ligands induce an IFN-I response in human monocyte-like cells, but not in differentiated macrophages. This TLR2-dependent IFN-I signaling originates from the cell surface and depends on MyD88; it involves combined activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappaB, driven by the kinases TBK1 and TAK1-IKKbeta, respectively. TLR2-stimulated monocytes produced modest IFNbeta levels that caused productive downstream signaling, reflected by STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes. Our findings reveal that the outcome of TLR2 signaling includes an IFN-I response in human monocytes, which is lost upon macrophage differentiation, and differs mechanistically from IFN-I-induction through TLR4. These findings point to molecular mechanisms tailored to the differentiation state of a cell and the nature of receptors activated to control and limit TLR-triggered IFN-I responses.

32732288	Interaction of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-induced canonical signaling with the noncanonical kinase cascades regulates glomerular hypertrophy and matrix protein deposition, which are early features of glomerulosclerosis. However, the specific target downstream of the TGFbeta receptor involved in the noncanonical signaling is unknown. Here, we show that TGFbeta increased the catalytic loop phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed abundantly in glomerular mesangial cells. TGFbeta increased phosphorylation of the PI 3-kinase-interacting Tyr-751 residue of PDGFRbeta, thus activating Akt. Inhibition of PDGFRbeta using a pharmacological inhibitor and siRNAs blocked TGFbeta-stimulated phosphorylation of proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), an intrinsic inhibitory component of mTORC1, and prevented activation of mTORC1 in the absence of any effect on Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. Expression of constitutively active myristoylated Akt reversed the siPDGFRbeta-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 activity; however, co-expression of the phospho-deficient mutant of PRAS40 inhibited the effect of myristoylated Akt, suggesting a definitive role of PRAS40 phosphorylation in mTORC1 activation downstream of PDGFRbeta in mesangial cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that PDGFRbeta-initiated phosphorylation of PRAS40 is required for TGFbeta-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and collagen I (alpha2) production. Increased activating phosphorylation of PDGFRbeta is also associated with enhanced TGFbeta expression and mTORC1 activation in the kidney cortex and glomeruli of diabetic mice and rats, respectively. Thus, pursuing TGFbeta noncanonical signaling, we identified how TGFbeta receptor I achieves mTORC1 activation through PDGFRbeta-mediated Akt/PRAS40 phosphorylation to spur mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein accumulation. These findings provide support for targeting PDGFRbeta in TGFbeta-driven renal fibrosis.	TGFbeta acts through PDGFRbeta to activate mTORC1 via the Akt/PRAS40 axis and causes glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein expression.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32817338	The retina-specific chaperone aryl hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1) is essential for the correct assembly of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which is a pivotal effector enzyme for phototransduction and vision because it hydrolyzes cGMP. AIPL1 interacts with the cytokine-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10, which gets covalently conjugated to hundreds of proteins and targets its conjugation substrates for proteasomal degradation, but whether FAT10 affects PDE6 function or turnover is unknown. Here, we show that FAT10 mRNA is expressed in human retina and identify rod PDE6 as a retina-specific substrate of FAT10 conjugation. We found that AIPL1 stabilizes the FAT10 monomer and the PDE6-FAT10 conjugate. Additionally, we elucidated the functional consequences of PDE6 FAT10ylation. On the one hand, we demonstrate that FAT10 targets PDE6 for proteasomal degradation by formation of a covalent isopeptide linkage. On the other hand, FAT10 inhibits PDE6 cGMP hydrolyzing activity by noncovalently interacting with the PDE6 GAFa and catalytic domains. Therefore, FAT10 may contribute to loss of PDE6 and, as a consequence, degeneration of retinal cells in eye diseases linked to inflammation and inherited blindness-causing mutations in AIPL1.	The ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 inhibits retinal PDE6 activity and mediates its proteasomal degradation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32938714	The mitotic kinase Aurora B regulates the condensation of chromatin into chromosomes by phosphorylating chromatin proteins during early mitosis, whereas the phosphatase PP1gamma performs the opposite function. The roles of Aurora B and PP1gamma must be tightly coordinated to maintain chromosomes at a high phosphorylation state, but the precise mechanisms regulating their function remain largely unclear. Here, mainly through immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we find that dissociation of PP1gamma from chromosomes is essential for maintaining chromosome phosphorylation. We uncover that PP1gamma is recruited to mitotic chromosomes by its regulatory subunit Repo-Man in the absence of Aurora B activity and that Aurora B regulates dissociation of PP1gamma by phosphorylating and disrupting PP1gamma-Repo-Man interactions on chromatin. Overexpression of Repo-Man mutants that cannot be phosphorylated or inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity resulted in the retention of PP1gamma on chromatin and prolonged the chromatin condensation process; a similar outcome was caused by the ectopic targeting of PP1gamma to chromatin. Together, our findings reveal a novel regulation mechanism of chromatin condensation in which Aurora B counteracts PP1gamma activity by releasing PP1gamma from Repo-Man and may have important implications for understanding the regulations of dynamic structural changes of the chromosomes in mitosis.	Aurora B regulates PP1gamma-Repo-Man interactions to maintain the chromosome condensation state.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32826315	The biogenesis of mitochondria requires the import of hundreds of precursor proteins. These proteins are transported post-translationally with the help of chaperones, meaning that the overproduction of mitochondrial proteins or the limited availability of chaperones can lead to the accumulation of cytosolic precursor proteins. This imposes a severe challenge to cytosolic proteostasis and triggers a specific transcription program called the mitoprotein-induced stress response, which activates the proteasome system. This coincides with the repression of mitochondrial proteins, including many proteins of the intermembrane space. In contrast, herein we report that the so-far-uncharacterized intermembrane space protein Mix23 is considerably up-regulated when mitochondrial import is perturbed. Mix23 is evolutionarily conserved and a homolog of the human protein CCDC58. We found that, like the subunits of the proteasome, Mix23 is under control of the transcription factor Rpn4. It is imported into mitochondria by the mitochondrial disulfide relay. Mix23 is critical for the efficient import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix, particularly if the function of the translocase of the inner membrane 23 is compromised such as in temperature-sensitive mutants of Tim17. Our observations identify Mix23 as a novel regulator or stabilizer of the mitochondrial protein import machinery that is specifically up-regulated upon mitoprotein-induced stress conditions.	The intermembrane space protein Mix23 is a novel stress-induced mitochondrial import factor.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32855239	Strategies to increase energy expenditure are an attractive approach to reduce excess fat storage and body weight to improve metabolic health. In mammals, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in brown and beige adipocytes uncouples fatty acid oxidation from ATP generation in mitochondria and promotes energy dissipation as heat. We set out to identify small molecules that enhance UCP1 levels and activity using a high-throughput screen of nearly 12,000 compounds in mouse brown adipocytes. We identified a family of compounds that increase Ucp1 expression and mitochondrial activity (including un-coupled respiration) in mouse brown adipocytes and human brown and white adipocytes. The mechanism of action may be through compound binding to A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 1, modulating its localization to mitochondria and its interaction with protein kinase A (PKA), a known node in the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway. In mice, the hit compound increased body temperature, UCP1 protein levels, and thermogenic gene expression. Some of the compound effects on mitochondrial function were UCP1- or AKAP1-independent, suggesting compound effects on multiple nodes of energy regulation. Overall, our results highlight a role for AKAP1 in thermogenesis, uncoupled respiration, and regulation energy balance.

32839273	Regulation of gene expression at the translational level is key to determining cell fate and function. An RNA-binding protein, RNG140 (caprin2), plays a role in eye lens differentiation and has been reported to function in translational regulation. However, the mechanism and its role in eyes has remained unclear. Here, we show that RNG140 binds to the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and suppresses translation through mechanisms involving suppression of eIF3-dependent translation initiation. Comprehensive ribosome profiling revealed that overexpression of RNG140 in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells reduces translation of long mRNAs, including those associated with cell proliferation. RNG140-mediated translational regulation also operates in the mouse eye, where RNG140 knockout increased the translation of long mRNAs. mRNAs involved in lens differentiation, such as crystallin mRNAs, are short and can escape translational inhibition by RNG140 and be translated in differentiating lenses. Thus, this study provides insights into the mechanistic basis of lens cell transition from proliferation to differentiation via RNG140-mediated translational regulation.

32848017	Previously we reported that adipocyte SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) deficiency blocks the activation of macroautophagy, leading to an increased abundance of BAX, a pro-death Bcl-2 family member, and activation and adipocyte cell death both in vitro and in vivo Here, we found that knockdown of SNAP23 inhibited the association of the autophagosome regulators ATG16L1 and ATG9 compartments by nutrient depletion and reduced the formation of ATG16L1 membrane puncta. ATG16L1 knockdown inhibited autophagy flux and increased BAX protein levels by suppressing BAX degradation. The elevation in BAX protein had no effect on BAX activation or cell death in the nutrient-replete state. However, following nutrient depletion, BAX was activated with a concomitant induction of cell death. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that SNAP23 and ATG16L1 proteins form a stable complex independent of nutrient condition, whereas in the nutrient-depleted state, BAX binds to SNAP23 to form a ternary BAX-SNAP23-ATG16L1 protein complex. Taken together, these data support a model in which SNAP23 plays a crucial function as a scaffold for ATG16L1 necessary for the suppression of BAX activation and induction of the intrinsic cell death program.

32843478	Cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) are valuable immunosuppressants for a range of clinical settings, including (but not limited to) organ transplantation and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. They function by inhibiting the activity of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin toward nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) in T-lymphocytes. However, use of CsA is associated with more serious side effects and worse clinical outcomes than FK506. Here we show that CsA, but not FK506, causes activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), an event which is normally an acute reaction to various types of intracellular insults, such as nutrient deficiency or endoplasmic reticulum stress. These effects of CsA involve at least two of the stress-activated protein kinases (GCN2 and PERK) that act on the translational machinery to slow down protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and thereby induce the ISR. These actions of CsA likely contribute to the adverse effects associated with its clinical application.	Cyclosporin A but not FK506 activates the integrated stress response in human cells.

32868454	Muscle atrophy is regulated by the balance between protein degradation and synthesis. FOXO1, a transcription factor, helps to determine this balance by activating pro-atrophic gene transcription when present in muscle fiber nuclei. Foxo1 nuclear efflux is promoted by AKT-mediated Foxo1 phosphorylation, eliminating FOXO1's atrophy-promoting effect. AKT activation can be promoted by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or insulin via a pathway including IGF1 or insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and AKT. We used confocal fluorescence time-lapse imaging of FOXO1-GFP in adult isolated living muscle fibers maintained in culture to explore the effects of IGF1 and insulin on FOXO1-GFP nuclear efflux with and without pharmacological inhibitors. We observed that although AKT inhibitor blocks the IGF1- or insulin-induced effect on FOXO1 nuclear efflux, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, which we show to be effective in these fibers, do not. We also found that inhibition of the protein kinase ACK1 or ATM contributes to the suppression of FOXO1 nuclear efflux after IGF1. These results indicate a novel pathway that has been unexplored in the IGF1- or insulin-induced regulation of FOXO1 and present information useful both for therapeutic interventions for muscle atrophy and for further investigative areas into insulin insensitivity and type 2 diabetes.

32873710	Recent proteomics studies of vertebrate striated muscle have identified lysine acetylation at several sites on actin. Acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that neutralizes lysine's positive charge. Positively charged residues on actin, particularly Lys(326) and Lys(328), are predicted to form critical electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin (Tpm) that promote its binding to filamentous (F)-actin and bias Tpm to an azimuthal location where it impedes myosin attachment. The troponin (Tn) complex also influences Tpm's position along F-actin as a function of Ca(2+) to regulate exposure of myosin-binding sites and, thus, myosin cross-bridge recruitment and force production. Interestingly, Lys(326) and Lys(328) are among the documented acetylated residues. Using an acetic anhydride-based labeling approach, we showed that excessive, nonspecific actin acetylation did not disrupt characteristic F-actin-Tpm binding. However, it significantly reduced Tpm-mediated inhibition of myosin attachment, as reflected by increased F-actin-Tpm motility that persisted in the presence of Tn and submaximal Ca(2+) Furthermore, decreasing the extent of chemical acetylation, to presumptively target highly reactive Lys(326) and Lys(328), also resulted in less inhibited F-actin-Tpm, implying that modifying only these residues influences Tpm's location and, potentially, thin filament regulation. To unequivocally determine the residue-specific consequences of acetylation on Tn-Tpm-based regulation of actomyosin activity, we assessed the effects of K326Q and K328Q acetyl (Ac)-mimetic actin on Ca(2+)-dependent, in vitro motility parameters of reconstituted thin filaments (RTFs). Incorporation of K328Q actin significantly enhanced Ca(2+) sensitivity of RTF activation relative to control. Together, our findings suggest that actin acetylation, especially Lys(328), modulates muscle contraction via disrupting inhibitory Tpm positioning.

32878983	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Pif1 helicase functions in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication and repair processes, preferentially unwinding RNA:DNA hybrids and resolving G-quadruplex structures. We sought to determine how the various activities of Pif1 are regulated in vivo Here, we report lysine acetylation of nuclear Pif1 and demonstrate that it influences both Pif1's cellular roles and core biochemical activities. Using Pif1 overexpression toxicity assays, we determined that the acetyltransferase NuA4 and deacetylase Rpd3 are primarily responsible for the dynamic acetylation of nuclear Pif1. MS analysis revealed that Pif1 was modified in several domains throughout the protein's sequence on the N terminus (Lys-118 and Lys-129), helicase domain (Lys-525, Lys-639, and Lys-725), and C terminus (Lys-800). Acetylation of Pif1 exacerbated its overexpression toxicity phenotype, which was alleviated upon deletion of its N terminus. Biochemical assays demonstrated that acetylation of Pif1 stimulated its helicase, ATPase, and DNA-binding activities, whereas maintaining its substrate preferences. Limited proteolysis assays indicate that acetylation of Pif1 induces a conformational change that may account for its altered enzymatic properties. We propose that acetylation is involved in regulating of Pif1 activities, influencing a multitude of DNA transactions vital to the maintenance of genome integrity.

32989052	The RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 binds to and stabilizes a number of mRNA sequences, including that of the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). Ataxin-2 is additionally involved in several processes requiring translation, such as germline formation, long-term habituation, and circadian rhythm formation. However, it has yet to be unambiguously demonstrated that Ataxin-2 is actually involved in activating the translation of its target mRNAs. Here we provide direct evidence from a polysome profile analysis showing that Ataxin-2 enhances translation of target mRNAs. Our recently established method for transcriptional pulse-chase analysis under conditions of suppressing deadenylation revealed that Ataxin-2 promotes post-transcriptional polyadenylation of the target mRNAs. Furthermore, Ataxin-2 binds to a poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 and a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD4 via its intrinsically disordered region (amino acids 906-1095) to recruit PAPD4 to the targets. Post-transcriptional polyadenylation by Ataxin-2 explains not only how it activates translation but also how it stabilizes target mRNAs, including TDP-43 mRNA. Ataxin-2 is known to be a potent modifier of TDP-43 proteinopathies and to play a causative role in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, so these findings suggest that Ataxin-2-induced cytoplasmic polyadenylation and activation of translation might impact neurodegeneration (i.e. TDP-43 proteinopathies), and this process could be a therapeutic target for Ataxin-2-related neurodegenerative disorders.	Direct evidence that Ataxin-2 is a translational activator mediating cytoplasmic polyadenylation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32467232	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in a variety of biological activities of the cell. However, less is known about how lncRNAs respond to environmental cues and what transcriptional mechanisms regulate their expression. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the lncRNA Tug1 (taurine upregulated gene 1) is crucial for the progression of diabetic kidney disease, a major microvascular complication of diabetes. Using a combination of proximity labeling with the engineered soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2), ChIP-qPCR, biotin-labeled oligonucleotide pulldown, and classical promoter luciferase assays in kidney podocytes, we extend our initial observations in the current study and now provide a detailed analysis on a how high-glucose milieu downregulates Tug1 expression in podocytes. Our results revealed an essential role for the transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) in controlling Tug1 transcription in the podocytes in response to increased glucose levels. Along with ChREBP, other coregulators, including MAX dimerization protein (MLX), MAX dimerization protein 1 (MXD1), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), were enriched at the Tug1 promoter under high-glucose conditions. These observations provide the first characterization of the mouse Tug1 promoter's response to the high-glucose milieu. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism by which ChREBP can coordinate glucose homeostasis with the expression of the lncRNA Tug1 and further our understanding of dynamic transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs in a disease state.

32913121	Ascorbic acid, a water-soluble antioxidant, regulates various biological processes and is thought to influence cholesterol. However, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning ascorbic acid-mediated cholesterol metabolism. Here, we determined if ascorbic acid can regulate expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) leading to its intracellular degradation, to influence low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism. At cellular levels, ascorbic acid inhibited PCSK9 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Consequently, LDLR expression and cellular LDL uptake were enhanced. Similar effects of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 and LDLR expression were observed in mouse primary hepatocytes. Mechanistically, ascorbic acid suppressed PCSK9 expression in a forkhead box O3-dependent manner. In addition, ascorbic acid increased LDLR transcription by regulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2. In vivo, administration of ascorbic acid reduced serum PCSK9 levels and enhanced liver LDLR expression in C57BL/6J mice. Reciprocally, lack of ascorbic acid supplementation in L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase deficient (Gulo (-/-)) mice increased circulating PCSK9 and LDL levels, and decreased liver LDLR expression, whereas ascorbic acid supplementation decreased PCSK9 and increased LDLR expression, ameliorating LDL levels in Gulo (-/-) mice fed a high fat diet. Moreover, ascorbic acid levels were negatively correlated to PCSK9, total and LDL levels in human serum samples. Taken together, these findings suggest that ascorbic acid reduces PCSK9 expression, leading to increased LDLR expression and cellular LDL uptake. Thus, supplementation of ascorbic acid may ameliorate lipid profiles in ascorbic acid-deficient species.

32907879	Podocyte injury is a critical step toward the progression of renal disease and is often associated with a loss of slit diaphragm proteins, including Podocin. Although there is a possibility that the extracellular domain of these slit diaphragm proteins can be a target for a pathological proteolysis, the precise mechanism driving the phenomenon remains unknown. Here we show that Matriptase, a membrane-anchored protein, was activated at podocytes in CKD patients and mice, whereas Matriptase inhibitors slowed the progression of mouse kidney disease. The mechanism could be accounted for by an imbalance favoring Matriptase over its cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1), because conditional depletion of HAI-1 in podocytes accelerated podocyte injury in mouse model. Matriptase was capable of cleaving Podocin, but such a reaction was blocked by either HAI-1 or dominant-negative Matriptase. Furthermore, the N terminus of Podocin, as a consequence of Matriptase cleavage of Podocin, translocated to nucleoli, suggesting that the N terminus of Podocin might be involved in the process of podocyte injury. Given these observations, we propose that the proteolytic cleavage of Podocin by Matriptase could potentially cause podocyte injury and that targeting Matriptase could be a novel therapeutic strategy for CKD patients.	Proteolytic cleavage of Podocin by Matriptase exacerbates podocyte injury.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32938713	Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by high prevalence of BRAF/NRAS mutations and hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), leading to uncontrolled melanoma growth. Efficacy of current targeted therapies against mutant BRAF or MEK1/2 have been hindered by existence of innate or development of acquired resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlled by MAPK pathway driving melanogenesis will help develop new treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Here, we identify E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 as a direct target of ELK1, a known transcriptional effector of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. We show that pharmacological inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2 in melanoma cells increases PARK2 expression. PARK2 overexpression reduces melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo and induces apoptosis. Conversely, its genetic silencing increases melanoma cell proliferation and reduces cell death. Further, we demonstrate that ELK1 is required by the BRAF-ERK1/2 pathway to repress PARK2 expression and promoter activity in melanoma cells. Clinically, PARK2 is highly expressed in WT BRAF and NRAS melanomas, but it is expressed at low levels in melanomas carrying BRAF/NRAS mutations. Overall, our data provide new insights into the tumor suppressive role of PARK2 in malignant melanoma and uncover a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of PARK2 via the ERK1/2-ELK1 axis. These findings suggest that reactivation of PARK2 may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract melanoma growth.	E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2, an inhibitor of melanoma cell growth, is repressed by the oncogenic ERK1/2-ELK1 transcriptional axis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32958557	In macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy), cytoplasmic molecules and organelles are randomly or selectively sequestered within double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation. In selective autophagy, the specificity of degradation targets is determined by autophagy receptors. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy receptors interact with specific targets and Atg11, resulting in the recruitment of a protein complex that initiates autophagosome formation. Previous studies have revealed that autophagy receptors are regulated by posttranslational modifications. In selective autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy), the receptor Atg36 localizes to peroxisomes by binding to the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3. We previously reported that Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25 (casein kinase 1delta), increasing the Atg36-Atg11 interaction and thereby stimulating pexophagy initiation. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Atg36 phosphorylation are unknown. Here, we show that Atg36 phosphorylation is abolished in cells lacking Pex3 or expressing a Pex3 mutant defective in the interaction with Atg36, suggesting that the interaction with Pex3 is essential for the Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg36. Using recombinant proteins, we further demonstrated that Pex3 directly promotes Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25. A co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the interaction of Atg36 with Hrr25 depends on Pex3. These results suggest that Pex3 increases the Atg36-Hrr25 interaction and thereby stimulates Atg36 phosphorylation on the peroxisomal membrane. In addition, we found that Pex3 binding protects Atg36 from proteasomal degradation. Thus, Pex3 confines Atg36 activity to the peroxisome by enhancing its phosphorylation and stability on this organelle.	Pex3 confines pexophagy receptor activity of Atg36 to peroxisomes by regulating Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32963106	Hypoxia-inducible factors are heterodimeric transcription factors that play a crucial role in a cell's ability to adapt to low oxygen. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) acts as a master regulator of HIF activity, and its targeting of prolyl hydroxylated HIF-alpha for proteasomal degradation under normoxia is thought to be a major mechanism for pVHL tumor suppression and cellular response to oxygen. Whether pVHL regulates other targets through a similar mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we identify TET2/3 as novel targets of pVHL. pVHL induces proteasomal degradation of TET2/3, resulting in reduced global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels. Conserved proline residues within the LAP/LAP-like motifs of these two proteins are hydroxylated by the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (PHD2/EGLN1 and PHD3/EGLN3), which is prerequisite for pVHL-mediated degradation. Using zebrafish as a model, we determined that global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels are enhanced in vhl-null, egln1a/b-double-null, and egln3-null embryos. Therefore, we reveal a novel function for the PHD-pVHL pathway in regulating TET protein stability and activity. These data extend our understanding of how TET proteins are regulated and provide new insight into the mechanisms of pVHL in tumor suppression.	TET is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the PHD-pVHL pathway to reduce DNA hydroxymethylation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32887795	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition associated with diverse etiologies and abrupt loss of renal function. In patients with sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders, the underlying disease or associated therapeutic interventions can cause hypoxia, cytotoxicity, and inflammatory insults to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), resulting in the onset of AKI. To uncover stress-responsive disease-modifying genes, here we have carried out renal transcriptome profiling in three distinct murine models of AKI. We find that Vgf nerve growth factor inducible gene up-regulation is a common transcriptional stress response in RTECs to ischemia-, cisplatin-, and rhabdomyolysis-associated renal injury. The Vgf gene encodes a secretory peptide precursor protein that has critical neuroendocrine functions; however, its role in the kidneys remains unknown. Our functional studies show that RTEC-specific Vgf gene ablation exacerbates ischemia-, cisplatin-, and rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI in vivo and cisplatin-induced RTEC cell death in vitro Importantly, aggravation of cisplatin-induced renal injury caused by Vgf gene ablation is partly reversed by TLQP-21, a Vgf-derived peptide. Finally, in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies showed that injury-induced Vgf up-regulation in RTECs is driven by the transcriptional regulator Sox9. These findings reveal a crucial downstream target of the Sox9-directed transcriptional program and identify Vgf as a stress-responsive protective gene in kidney tubular epithelial cells.

32913128	The calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CaMKK2) is a key regulator of cellular and whole-body energy metabolism. It is known to be activated by increases in intracellular Ca(2+), but the mechanisms by which it is inactivated are less clear. CaMKK2 inhibition protects against prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and metabolic derangements induced by a high-fat diet; therefore, elucidating the intracellular mechanisms that inactivate CaMKK2 has important therapeutic implications. Here we show that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in cells inactivates CaMKK2 by phosphorylation of three conserved serine residues. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser(495) directly impairs calcium-calmodulin activation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser(100) and Ser(511) mediate recruitment of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins that hold CaMKK2 in the inactivated state by preventing dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser(495) We also report the crystal structure of 14-3-3zeta bound to a synthetic diphosphorylated peptide that reveals how the canonical (Ser(511)) and noncanonical (Ser(100)) 14-3-3 consensus sites on CaMKK2 cooperate to bind 14-3-3 proteins. Our findings provide detailed molecular insights into how cAMP-PKA signaling inactivates CaMKK2 and reveals a pathway to inhibit CaMKK2 with potential for treating human diseases.

32967969	The glucagon receptor (GCGR) activated by the peptide hormone glucagon is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates blood glucose levels. Ubiquitination influences trafficking and signaling of many GPCRs, but its characterization for the GCGR is lacking. Using endocytic colocalization and ubiquitination assays, we have identified a correlation between the ubiquitination profile and recycling of the GCGR. Our experiments revealed that GCGRs are constitutively ubiquitinated at the cell surface. Glucagon stimulation not only promoted GCGR endocytic trafficking through Rab5a early endosomes and Rab4a recycling endosomes, but also induced rapid deubiquitination of GCGRs. Inhibiting GCGR internalization or disrupting endocytic trafficking prevented agonist-induced deubiquitination of the GCGR. Furthermore, a Rab4a dominant negative (DN) that blocks trafficking at recycling endosomes enabled GCGR deubiquitination, whereas a Rab5a DN that blocks trafficking at early endosomes eliminated agonist-induced GCGR deubiquitination. By down-regulating candidate deubiquitinases that are either linked with GPCR trafficking or localized on endosomes, we identified signal-transducing adaptor molecule-binding protein (STAMBP) and ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) as cognate deubiquitinases for the GCGR. Our data suggest that USP33 constitutively deubiquitinates the GCGR, whereas both STAMBP and USP33 deubiquitinate agonist-activated GCGRs at early endosomes. A mutant GCGR with all five intracellular lysines altered to arginines remains deubiquitinated and shows augmented trafficking to Rab4a recycling endosomes compared with the WT, thus affirming the role of deubiquitination in GCGR recycling. We conclude that the GCGRs are rapidly deubiquitinated after agonist-activation to facilitate Rab4a-dependent recycling and that USP33 and STAMBP activities are critical for the endocytic recycling of the GCGR.	Agonist-activated glucagon receptors are deubiquitinated at early endosomes by two distinct deubiquitinases to facilitate Rab4a-dependent recycling.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32978258	Autophagy plays critical roles in the maintenance of endothelial cells in response to cellular stress caused by blood flow. There is growing evidence that both cell adhesion and cell detachment can modulate autophagy, but the mechanisms responsible for this regulation remain unclear. Immunoglobulin and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1) is a cell adhesion molecule that regulates angiogenesis and endothelial barrier function. In this study, using various biochemical and cellular assays, we demonstrate that IGPR-1 is activated by autophagy-inducing stimuli, such as amino acid starvation, nutrient deprivation, rapamycin, and lipopolysaccharide. Manipulating the IkappaB kinase beta activity coupled with in vivo and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that IkappaB kinase beta is a key serine/threonine kinase activated by autophagy stimuli and that it catalyzes phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser(220) The subsequent activation of IGPR-1, in turn, stimulates phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which leads to phosphorylation of the major pro-autophagy proteins ULK1 and Beclin-1 (BECN1), increased LC3-II levels, and accumulation of LC3 punctum. Thus, our data demonstrate that IGPR-1 is activated by autophagy-inducing stimuli and in response regulates autophagy, connecting cell adhesion to autophagy. These findings may have important significance for autophagy-driven pathologies such cardiovascular diseases and cancer and suggest that IGPR-1 may serve as a promising therapeutic target.

32989053	The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is one of the major pathways that regulates embryonic development, adult homeostasis, and stem cell self-renewal. In this pathway, transcription factors T-cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) serve as a key switch to repress or activate Wnt target gene transcription by recruiting repressor molecules or interacting with the beta-catenin effector, respectively. It has become evident that the protein stability of the TCF/LEF family members may play a critical role in controlling the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. However, factors that regulate the stability of TCF/LEFs remain largely unknown. Here, we report that pVHL binding protein 1 (VBP1) regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by controlling the stability of TCF/LEFs. Surprisingly, we found that either overexpression or knockdown of VBP1 decreased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity in both cultured cells and zebrafish embryos. Mechanistically, VBP1 directly binds to all four TCF/LEF family members and von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL). Either overexpression or knockdown of VBP1 increases the association between TCF/LEFs and pVHL and then decreases the protein levels of TCF/LEFs via proteasomal degradation. Together, our results provide mechanistic insights into the roles of VBP1 in controlling TCF/LEFs protein stability and regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activity.

32989051	Adult progenitor cell populations typically exist in a quiescent state within a controlled niche environment. However, various stresses or forms of damage can disrupt this state, which often leads to dysfunction and aging. We built a glucocorticoid (GC)-induced liver damage model of mice, found that GC stress induced liver damage, leading to consequences for progenitor cells expansion. However, the mechanisms by which niche factors cause progenitor cells proliferation are largely unknown. We demonstrate that, within the liver progenitor cells niche, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is responsible for driving a subset of progenitor cells to break quiescence. We show that GC stress causes aging of the niche, which induces the up-regulation of Gal-3. The increased Gal-3 population increasingly interacts with the progenitor cell marker CD133, which triggers focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling. This results in the loss of quiescence and leads to the eventual stemness exhaustion of progenitor cells. Conversely, blocking Gal-3 with the inhibitor TD139 prevents the loss of stemness and improves liver function. These experiments identify a stress-dependent change in progenitor cell niche that directly influence liver progenitor cell quiescence and function.	Secretory galectin-3 induced by glucocorticoid stress triggers stemness exhaustion of hepatic progenitor cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32948655	Phospholipase Cepsilon (PLCepsilon) is activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases through direct interactions with small GTPases, including Rap1A and Ras. Although Ras has been reported to allosterically activate the lipase, it is not known whether Rap1A has the same ability or what its molecular mechanism might be. Rap1A activates PLCepsilon in response to the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, translocating the complex to the perinuclear membrane. Because the C-terminal Ras association (RA2) domain of PLCepsilon was proposed to the primary binding site for Rap1A, we first confirmed using purified proteins that the RA2 domain is indeed essential for activation by Rap1A. However, we also showed that the PLCepsilon pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and first two EF hands (EF1/2) are required for Rap1A activation and identified hydrophobic residues on the surface of the RA2 domain that are also necessary. Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that Rap1A binding induces and stabilizes discrete conformational states in PLCepsilon variants that can be activated by the GTPase. These data, together with the recent structure of a catalytically active fragment of PLCepsilon, provide the first evidence that Rap1A, and by extension Ras, allosterically activate the lipase by promoting and stabilizing interactions between the RA2 domain and the PLCepsilon core.

32978252	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate signaling cascades via G-proteins and beta-arrestins (betaarr). betaarr-dependent actions begin with recruitment of betaarr to the phosphorylated receptor tail and are followed by engagement with the receptor core. betaarrs are known to act as adaptor proteins binding receptors and various effectors, but it is unclear whether in addition to the scaffolding role betaarrs can allosterically activate their downstream targets. Here we demonstrate the direct allosteric activation of proto-oncogene kinase Src by GPCR-betaarr complexes in vitro and establish the conformational basis of the activation. Whereas free betaarr1 had no effect on Src activity, betaarr1 in complex with M2 muscarinic or beta2-adrenergic receptors reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs activate Src by reducing the lag phase in Src autophosphorylation. Interestingly, receptor-betaarr1 complexes formed with a betaarr1 mutant, in which the finger-loop, required to interact with the receptor core, has been deleted, fully retain the ability to activate Src. Similarly, betaarr1 in complex with only a phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the vasopressin 2 receptor activates Src as efficiently as GPCR-betaarr complexes. In contrast, betaarr1 and chimeric M2 receptor with nonphosphorylated C-terminal tail failed to activate Src. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the phosphorylated GPCR tail interaction with betaarr1 is necessary and sufficient to empower it to allosterically activate Src. Our findings may have implications for understanding more broadly the mechanisms of allosteric activation of downstream targets by betaarrs.

33060203	Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a multimodal receptor that is responsible for nociceptive, thermal, and mechanical sensations. However, which biomolecular partners specifically interact with TRPV1 remains to be elucidated. Here, we used cDNA library screening of genes from mouse dorsal root ganglia combined with patch-clamp electrophysiology to identify the voltage-gated potassium channel auxiliary subunit Kvbeta1 physically interacting with TRPV1 channel and regulating its function. The interaction was validated in situ using endogenous dorsal root ganglia neurons, as well as a recombinant expression model in HEK 293T cells. The presence of Kvbeta1 enhanced the expression stability of TRPV1 channels on the plasma membrane and the nociceptive current density. Surprisingly, Kvbeta1 interaction also shifted the temperature threshold for TRPV1 thermal activation. Using site-specific mapping, we further revealed that Kvbeta1 interacted with the membrane-distal domain and membrane-proximal domain of TRPV1 to regulate its membrane expression and temperature-activation threshold, respectively. Our data therefore suggest that Kvbeta1 is a key element in the TRPV1 signaling complex and exerts dual regulatory effects in a site-specific manner.	Site-specific contacts enable distinct modes of TRPV1 regulation by the potassium channel Kvbeta1 subunit.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33028635	We have observed overexpression of PACS-1, a cytosolic sorting protein in primary cervical tumors. Absence of exonic mutations and overexpression at the RNA level suggested a transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional regulation. University of California Santa Cruz genome browser analysis of PACS-1 micro RNAs (miR), revealed two 8-base target sequences at the 3' terminus for hsa-miR-34a and hsa-miR-449a. Quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting studies showed reduced or loss of expression of the two microRNAs in cervical cancer cell lines and primary tumors, indicating dysregulation of these two microRNAs in cervical cancer. Loss of PACS-1 with siRNA or exogenous expression of hsa-miR-34a or hsa-miR-449a in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines resulted in DNA damage response, S-phase cell cycle arrest, and reduction in cell growth. Furthermore, the siRNA studies showed that loss of PACS-1 expression was accompanied by increased nuclear gammaH2AX expression, Lys(382)-p53 acetylation, and genomic instability. PACS-1 re-expression through LNA-hsa-anti-miR-34a or -449a or through PACS-1 cDNA transfection led to the reversal of DNA damage response and restoration of cell growth. Release of cells post 24-h serum starvation showed PACS-1 nuclear localization at G1-S phase of the cell cycle. Our results therefore indicate that the loss of hsa-miR-34a and hsa-miR-449a expression in cervical cancer leads to overexpression of PACS-1 and suppression of DNA damage response, resulting in the development of chemo-resistant tumors.	Dysregulation of hsa-miR-34a and hsa-miR-449a leads to overexpression of PACS-1 and loss of DNA damage response (DDR) in cervical cancer.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33051205	Heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) and -1 (HO1) catalyze heme degradation to biliverdin, CO, and iron, forming an essential link in the heme metabolism network. Tight regulation of the cellular levels and catalytic activities of HO1 and HO2 is important for maintaining heme homeostasis. HO1 expression is transcriptionally regulated; however, HO2 expression is constitutive. How the cellular levels and activity of HO2 are regulated remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of post-translational regulation of cellular HO2 levels by heme. We find that, under heme-deficient conditions, HO2 is destabilized and targeted for degradation, suggesting that heme plays a direct role in HO2 regulation. HO2 has three heme binding sites: one at its catalytic site and the others at its two heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). We report that, in contrast to other HRM-containing proteins, the cellular protein level and degradation rate of HO2 are independent of heme binding to the HRMs. Rather, under heme deficiency, loss of heme binding to the catalytic site destabilizes HO2. Consistently, an HO2 catalytic site variant that is unable to bind heme exhibits a constant low protein level and an enhanced protein degradation rate compared with the WT HO2. Finally, HO2 is degraded by the lysosome through chaperone-mediated autophagy, distinct from other HRM-containing proteins and HO1, which are degraded by the proteasome. These results reveal a novel aspect of HO2 regulation and deepen our understanding of HO2's role in maintaining heme homeostasis, paving the way for future investigation into HO2's pathophysiological role in heme deficiency response.

33037073	The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin increases trafficking of KATP and Kv2.1 channels to the pancreatic beta-cell surface, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and suppression of insulin secretion. We have previously shown that this effect of leptin is mediated by the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs). It does so by potentiating NMDAR activity, thus enhancing Ca(2+) influx and the ensuing downstream signaling events that drive channel trafficking to the cell surface. However, the molecular mechanism by which leptin potentiates NMDARs in beta-cells remains unknown. Here, we report that leptin augments NMDAR function via Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the GluN2A subunit. Leptin-induced membrane hyperpolarization diminished upon pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A but not GluN2B, indicating involvement of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. GluN2A harbors tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated by Src family kinases, potentiate NMDAR activity. We found that leptin increases phosphorylation of Tyr-418 in Src, an indicator of kinase activation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src or overexpression of a kinase-dead Src mutant prevented the effect of leptin, whereas a Src kinase activator peptide mimicked it. Using mutant GluN2A overexpression, we show that Tyr-1292 and Tyr-1387 but not Tyr-1325 are responsible for the effect of leptin. Importantly, beta-cells from db/db mice, a type 2 diabetes mouse model lacking functional leptin receptors, or from obese diabetic human donors failed to respond to leptin but hyperpolarized in response to NMDA. Our study reveals a signaling pathway wherein leptin modulates NMDARs via Src to regulate beta-cell excitability and suggests NMDARs as a potential target to overcome leptin resistance.

33454003	Thoracic great vessels such as the aorta and subclavian arteries are formed through dynamic remodeling of embryonic pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs). Previous work has shown that loss of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hey1 in mice causes abnormal fourth PAA development and lethal great vessel anomalies resembling congenital malformations in humans. However, how Hey1 mediates vascular formation remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that Hey1 in vascular endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells, played essential roles for PAA development and great vessel morphogenesis in mouse embryos. Tek-Cre-mediated Hey1 deletion in endothelial cells affected endothelial tube formation and smooth muscle differentiation in embryonic fourth PAAs and resulted in interruption of the aortic arch and other great vessel malformations. Cell specificity and signal responsiveness of Hey1 expression were controlled through multiple cis-regulatory regions. We found two distal genomic regions that had enhancer activity in endothelial cells and in the pharyngeal epithelium and somites, respectively. The novel endothelial enhancer was conserved across species and was specific to large-caliber arteries. Its transcriptional activity was regulated by Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo, but not by ALK1 signaling and other transcription factors implicated in endothelial cell specificity. The distal endothelial enhancer was not essential for basal Hey1 expression in mouse embryos but may likely serve for Notch-dependent transcriptional control in endothelial cells together with the proximal regulatory region. These findings help in understanding the significance and regulation of endothelial Hey1 as a mediator of multiple signaling pathways in embryonic vascular formation.

33453998	Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1beta) is a tissue-specific transcription factor that is required for normal kidney development and renal epithelial differentiation. Mutations of HNF-1beta produce congenital kidney abnormalities and inherited renal tubulopathies. Here, we show that ablation of HNF-1beta in mIMCD3 renal epithelial cells results in activation of beta-catenin and increased expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a downstream effector in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Increased expression and nuclear localization of LEF1 are also observed in cystic kidneys from Hnf1b mutant mice. Expression of dominant-negative mutant HNF-1beta in mIMCD3 cells produces hyperresponsiveness to exogenous Wnt ligands, which is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lef1. WT HNF-1beta binds to two evolutionarily conserved sites located 94 and 30 kb from the mouse Lef1 promoter. Ablation of HNF-1beta decreases H3K27 trimethylation repressive marks and increases beta-catenin occupancy at a site 4 kb upstream to Lef1. Mechanistically, WT HNF-1beta recruits the polycomb-repressive complex 2 that catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation. Deletion of the beta-catenin-binding domain of LEF1 in HNF-1beta-deficient cells abolishes the increase in Lef1 transcription and decreases the expression of downstream Wnt target genes. The canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, is also a direct transcriptional target of HNF-1beta through binding to negative regulatory elements in the gene promoter. These findings demonstrate that HNF-1beta regulates canonical Wnt target genes through long-range effects on histone methylation at Wnt enhancers and reveal a new mode of active transcriptional repression by HNF-1beta.

33122197	RAS genes are the most commonly mutated in human cancers and play critical roles in tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Identification of targets that block RAS signaling is pivotal to develop therapies for RAS-related cancer. As RAS translocation to the plasma membrane (PM) is essential for its effective signal transduction, we devised a high-content screening assay to search for genes regulating KRAS membrane association. We found that the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 regulates the plasma membrane localization of KRAS. Knockdown of PTPN2 reduced the proliferation and promoted apoptosis in KRAS-dependent cancer cells, but not in KRAS-independent cells. Mechanistically, PTPN2 negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of KRAS, which, in turn, affects the activation KRAS and its downstream signaling. Consistently, analysis of the TCGA database demonstrates that high expression of PTPN2 is significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients with KRAS-mutant pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These results indicate that PTPN2 is a key regulator of KRAS and may serve as a new target for therapy of KRAS-driven cancer.	PTPN2 regulates the activation of KRAS and plays a critical role in proliferation and survival of KRAS-driven cancer cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33109608	Acute lung injury (ALI), is a rapidly progressing heterogenous pulmonary disorder that possesses a high risk of mortality. Accumulating evidence has implicated the activation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB [NF-kappaB(p65)] activation in the pathological process of ALI. microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small RNA molecules, have emerged as major governors due to their post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in a wide array of pathological processes, including ALI. The dysregulation of miRNAs and NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in human diseases. In the current study, we set out to decipher the convergence of miR-99b and p65 NF-kappaB activation in ALI pathology. We measured the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using ELISA. MH-S cells were cultured and their viability were detected with cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) assays. The results showed that miR-99b was up-regulated, while PRDM1 was down-regulated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine model of ALI. Mechanistic investigations showed that NF-kappaB(p65) was enriched at the miR-99b promoter region, and further promoted its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, miR-99b targeted PRDM1 by binding to its 3'UTR, causing its down-regulation. This in-creased lung injury, as evidenced by increased wet/dry ratio of mouse lung, myeloperoxidase activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissues. Together, our findings indicate that NF-kappaB(p65) promotion of miR-99b can aggravate ALI in mice by down-regulating the expression of PRDM1.	Transcription factor NF-kappaB promotes acute lung injury via microRNA-99b-mediated PRDM1 down-regulation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33122196	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a pandemic and caused global public health crisis. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides angiotensin II to control vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we investigated how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity approximately 3-10 fold against model peptide substrates, such as caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog. The enhancement in ACE2 enzymatic function was mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain. These results highlighted the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection to enhance ACE2 activity, which may be relevant to the cardiovascular symptoms associated with COVID-19.	High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33109614	Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential constituent of the bacterial cell wall. During cell division, the machinery responsible for PG synthesis localizes mid-cell, at the septum, under the control of a multiprotein complex called the divisome. In Escherichia coli, septal PG synthesis and cell constriction rely on the accumulation of FtsN at the division site. Interestingly, a short sequence of FtsN (Leu(75)-Gln(93), known as (E)FtsN) was shown to be essential and sufficient for its functioning in vivo, but what exactly this sequence is doing remained unknown. Here, we show that (E)FtsN binds specifically to the major PG synthase PBP1b and is sufficient to stimulate its biosynthetic glycosyltransferase (GTase) activity. We also report the crystal structure of PBP1b in complex with (E)FtsN, which demonstrates that (E)FtsN binds at the junction between the GTase and UB2H domains of PBP1b. Interestingly, mutations to two residues (R141A/R397A) within the (E)FtsN-binding pocket reduced the activation of PBP1b by FtsN but not by the lipoprotein LpoB. This mutant was unable to rescue the DeltaponB-ponA (ts) strain, which lacks PBP1b and has a thermosensitive PBP1a, at nonpermissive temperature and induced a mild cell-chaining phenotype and cell lysis. Altogether, the results show that (E)FtsN interacts with PBP1b and that this interaction plays a role in the activation of its GTase activity by FtsN, which may contribute to the overall septal PG synthesis and regulation during cell division.	The bacterial cell division protein fragment (E)FtsN binds to and activates the major peptidoglycan synthase PBP1b.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33028632	The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (FXN) expression in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the FXN locus caused by the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a human FXN-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by approximately 1.5-fold in the reporter cell line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is important in the regulation of FXN expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.	Inhibition of the SUV4-20 H1 histone methyltransferase increases frataxin expression in Friedreich's ataxia patient cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33067321	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss and accumulation of beta-amyloid-protein (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma. Sleep impairment is associated with AD and affects about 25-40% of patients in the mild-to-moderate stages of the disease. Sleep deprivation leads to increased Abeta production; however, its mechanism remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the increase in core body temperature induced by sleep deprivation may promote Abeta production. Here, we report temperature-dependent regulation of Abeta production. We found that an increase in temperature, from 37 degrees C to 39 degrees C, significantly increased Abeta production in amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing cells. We also found that high temperature (39 degrees C) significantly increased the expression levels of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the C-terminal fragment of presenilin 1 (PS1-CTF) and promoted gamma-secretase complex formation. Interestingly, Hsp90 was associated with the components of the premature gamma-secretase complex, anterior pharynx-defective-1 (APH-1), and nicastrin (NCT) but was not associated with PS1-CTF or presenilin enhancer-2. Hsp90 knockdown abolished the increased level of Abeta production and the increased formation of the gamma-secretase complex at high temperature in culture. Furthermore, with in vivo experiments, we observed increases in the levels of Hsp90, PS1-CTF, NCT, and the gamma-secretase complex in the cortex of mice housed at higher room temperature (30 degrees C) compared with those housed at standard room temperature (23 degrees C). Our results suggest that high temperature regulates Abeta production by modulating gamma-secretase complex formation through the binding of Hsp90 to NCT/APH-1.	High temperature promotes amyloid beta-protein production and gamma-secretase complex formation via Hsp90.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33082140	Evolving evidence suggests that nicotine may contribute to impaired asthma control by stimulating expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin associated with airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness. We explored the hypothesis that nicotine increases NGF by reducing lung fibroblast (LF) microRNA-98 (miR-98) and PPARgamma levels, thus promoting airway remodeling. Levels of NGF, miR-98, PPARgamma, fibronectin 1 (FN1), endothelin-1 (EDN1, herein referred to as ET-1), and collagen (COL1A1 and COL3A1) were measured in human LFs isolated from smoking donors, in mouse primary LFs exposed to nicotine (50 mug/ml), and in whole lung homogenates from mice chronically exposed to nicotine (100 mug/ml) in the drinking water. In selected studies, these pathways were manipulated in LFs with miR-98 inhibitor (anti-miR-98), miR-98 overexpression (miR-98 mimic), or the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone. Compared with unexposed controls, nicotine increased NGF, FN1, ET-1, COL1A1, and COL3A1 expression in human and mouse LFs and mouse lung homogenates. In contrast, nicotine reduced miR-98 levels in LFs in vitro and in lung homogenates in vivo Treatment with anti-miR-98 alone was sufficient to recapitulate increases in NGF, FN1, and ET-1, whereas treatment with a miR-98 mimic significantly suppressed luciferase expression in cells transfected with a luciferase reporter linked to the putative seed sequence in the NGF 3'UTR and also abrogated nicotine-induced increases in NGF, FN1, and ET-1 in LFs. Similarly, rosiglitazone increased miR-98 and reversed nicotine-induced increases in NGF, FN1, and ET-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that nicotine-induced increases in NGF and other markers of airway remodeling are negatively regulated by miR-98.	MicroRNA-98 reduces nerve growth factor expression in nicotine-induced airway remodeling.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33097595	Timely repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential to maintaining genomic integrity and preventing illnesses induced by genetic abnormalities. We previously demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 plays a critical tumor suppressing role via its interaction with RNF20 (ring finger protein 20) in shaping chromatin landscape and preserving genomic stability. However, the mechanism that mobilizes SMURF2 in response to DNA damage remains unclear. Using biochemical approaches and MS analysis, we show that upon the onset of the DNA-damage response, SMURF2 becomes phosphorylated at Ser(384) by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase, and this phosphorylation is required for its interaction with RNF20. We demonstrate that a SMURF2 mutant with an S384A substitution has reduced capacity to ubiquitinate RNF20 while promoting Smad3 ubiquitination unabatedly. More importantly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing the SMURF2 S384A mutant show a weakened ability to sustain the DSB response compared with those expressing WT SMURF2 following etoposide treatment. These data indicate that SMURF2-mediated RNF20 ubiquitination and degradation controlled by ataxia telangiectasia mutated-induced phosphorylation at Ser(384) constitutes a negative feedback loop that regulates DSB repair.	Phosphorylation of SMURF2 by ATM exerts a negative feedback control of DNA damage response.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33122193	Methionine, through S-adenosylmethionine, activates a multifaceted growth program in which ribosome biogenesis, carbon metabolism, and amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis are induced. This growth program requires the activity of the Gcn4 transcription factor (called ATF4 in mammals), which facilitates the supply of metabolic precursors that are essential for anabolism. However, how Gcn4 itself is regulated in the presence of methionine is unknown. Here, we discover that Gcn4 protein levels are increased by methionine, despite conditions of high cell growth and translation (in which the roles of Gcn4 are not well-studied). We demonstrate that this mechanism of Gcn4 induction is independent of transcription, as well as the conventional Gcn2/eIF2alpha-mediated increased translation of Gcn4. Instead, when methionine is abundant, Gcn4 phosphorylation is decreased, which reduces its ubiquitination and therefore degradation. Gcn4 is dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); our data show that when methionine is abundant, the conserved methyltransferase Ppm1 methylates and alters the activity of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, shifting the balance of Gcn4 toward a dephosphorylated, stable state. The absence of Ppm1 or the loss of the PP2A methylation destabilizes Gcn4 even when methionine is abundant, leading to collapse of the Gcn4-dependent anabolic program. These findings reveal a novel, methionine-dependent signaling and regulatory axis. Here methionine directs the conserved methyltransferase Ppm1 via its target phosphatase PP2A to selectively stabilize Gcn4. Through this, cells conditionally modify a major phosphatase to stabilize a metabolic master regulator and drive anabolism.	Methylated PP2A stabilizes Gcn4 to enable a methionine-induced anabolic program.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33837725	GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family shown to play important roles in cell adhesion, brain development, immune function, and tumorigenesis. GPR56 is highly upregulated in colorectal cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. Several studies have shown GPR56 couples to the Galpha12/13 class of heterotrimeric G-proteins to promote RhoA activation. However, due to its structural complexity and lack of a high-affinity receptor-specific ligand, the complete GPR56 signaling mechanism remains largely unknown. To delineate the activation mechanism and intracellular signaling functions of GPR56, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain (ECD). Using deletion mutants, we mapped the mAb binding site to the GAIN domain, which mediates membrane-proximal autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD. We showed that GPR56 overexpression in 293T cells leads to increased phosphorylation of Src, Fak, and paxillin adhesion proteins and activation of the Galpha12/13-RhoA-mediated serum response factor (SRF) pathway. Treatment with the mAb potentiated Src-Fak phosphorylation, RhoA-SRF signaling, and cell adhesion. Consistently, GPR56 knockdown in colorectal cancer cells decreased Src-Fak pathway phosphorylation and cell adhesion. Interestingly, GPR56-mediated activation of Src-Fak phosphorylation occurred independent of RhoA, yet mAb-induced potentiation of RhoA-SRF signaling was Src-dependent. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal portion of the Serine-Threonine-Proline-rich (STP) region, adjacent to the GAIN domain, was required for Src-Fak activation. However, autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD was dispensable. These data support a new ECD-dependent mechanism by which GPR56 functions to regulate adhesion through activation of Src-Fak signaling.

33380426	Down syndrome (DS) is mainly caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), and patients display a variety of developmental symptoms, including characteristic facial features, physical growth delay, intellectual disability, and neurodegeneration (i.e., Alzheimer's disease; AD). One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is insoluble deposits of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that consist of hyperphosphorylated tau. The human DYRK1A gene is mapped to chromosome 21, and the protein is associated with the formation of inclusion bodies in AD. For example, DYRK1A directly phosphorylates multiple serine and threonine residues of tau, including Thr212. However, the mechanism underpinning DYRK1A involvement in Trisomy 21-related pathological tau aggregation remains unknown. Here, we explored a novel regulatory mechanism of DYRK1A and subsequent tau pathology through a phosphatase. Using LC-MS/MS technology, we analyzed multiple DYRK1A-binding proteins, including PPM1B, a member of the PP2C family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, in HEK293 cells. We found that PPM1B dephosphorylates DYRK1A at Ser258, contributing to the inhibition of DYRK1A activity. Moreover, PPM1B-mediated dephosphorylation of DYRK1A reduced tau phosphorylation at Thr212, leading to inhibition of toxic tau oligomerization and aggregation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that DYRK1A autophosphorylates Ser258, the dephosphorylation target of PPM1B, and PPM1B negatively regulates DYRK1A activity. This finding also suggests that PPM1B reduces the toxic formation of phospho-tau protein via DYRK1A modulation, possibly providing a novel cellular protective mechanism to regulate toxic tau-mediated neuropathology in AD of DS.	Protein phosphatase PPM1B inhibits DYRK1A kinase through dephosphorylation of pS258 and reduces toxic tau aggregation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33450223	Autophagy is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis through removing impaired organelles. It has recently been found to play pivotal roles in diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with increased bone fracture risk and loss of bone density. However, the mechanism whereby autophagy modulates DM-induced bone loss is not fully elucidated. Previous work has shown that 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) exerts positive effects on autophagy, thus affecting bone metabolism. Here, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in the regulation of diabetic bone metabolism. Using Micro-CT, Elisa, histology, and histomorphometry analysis, we demonstrated that 1,25D rescues glucose metabolism dysfunction and ameliorates bone loss in diabetic mice. In vitro, 1,25D alleviated primary osteoblast dysfunction and intracellular oxidative stress through reducing prolonged high-glucose-mediated excessive autophagy in primary osteoblasts, reflected by decreased protein level of Beclin1 and LC3. Of note, the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAP) ablated the positive effects of 1,25D in diabetic environment, leading to a marked increase in autolysosomes and autophagosomes, examined by mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling. The excessive autophagy induced by high glucose was deleterious to proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts. Additionally, biochemical studies identified that PI3K/Akt signaling could be activated by 1,25D, resulting in the inhibition of FoxO1. We confirmed that FoxO1 deficiency alleviated high-glucose-induced autophagy and improved biological functions of primary osteoblasts. Together, our results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway is involved in the osteoprotective effect of 1,25D by attenuating autophagy in diabetes, providing a novel insight for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-caused bone loss.	1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ameliorates diabetes-induced bone loss by attenuating FoxO1-mediated autophagy.

33453283	Androglobin (ADGB) represents the latest addition to the globin superfamily in metazoans. The chimeric protein comprises a calpain domain and a unique circularly permutated globin domain. ADGB expression levels are most abundant in mammalian testis, but its cell-type-specific expression, regulation, and function have remained unexplored. Analyzing bulk and single-cell mRNA-Seq data from mammalian tissues, we found that-in addition to the testes-ADGB is prominently expressed in the female reproductive tract, lungs, and brain, specifically being associated with cell types forming motile cilia. Correlation analysis suggested coregulation of ADGB with FOXJ1, a crucial transcription factor of ciliogenesis. Investigating the transcriptional regulation of the ADGB gene, we characterized its promoter using epigenomic datasets, exogenous promoter-dependent luciferase assays, and CRISPR/dCas9-VPR-mediated activation approaches. Reporter gene assays revealed that FOXJ1 indeed substantially enhanced luciferase activity driven by the ADGB promoter. ChIP assays confirmed binding of FOXJ1 to the endogenous ADGB promoter region. We dissected the minimal sequence required for FOXJ1-dependent regulation and fine mapped the FOXJ1 binding site to two evolutionarily conserved regions within the ADGB promoter. FOXJ1 overexpression significantly increased endogenous ADGB mRNA levels in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. Similar results were observed upon RFX2 overexpression, another key transcription factor in ciliogenesis. The complex transcriptional regulation of the ADGB locus was illustrated by identifying a distal enhancer, responsible for synergistic regulation by RFX2 and FOXJ1. Finally, cell culture studies indicated an ADGB-dependent increase in the number of ciliated cells upon overexpression of the full-length protein, confirming a ciliogenesis-associated role of ADGB in mammals.	Androglobin gene expression patterns and FOXJ1-dependent regulation indicate its functional association with ciliogenesis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33460650	Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-regulated protein exhibiting cytoprotective properties through a poorly understood mechanism in various in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal and non-neuronal damage. Although initially characterized as a secreted neurotrophic factor for midbrain dopamine neurons, MANF has recently gained more interest for its intracellular role in regulating the ER homeostasis, including serving as a cofactor of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). We aimed for a better understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of MANF. Here we show for the first time that MANF promotes the survival of ER-stressed neurons in vitro as a general unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator, affecting several UPR pathways simultaneously. Interestingly, MANF does not affect naive neurons. We hypothesize that MANF regulates UPR signaling toward a mode more compatible with neuronal survival. Screening of MANF interacting proteins from two mammalian cell lines revealed a conserved interactome of 15 proteins including several ER chaperones such as GRP78, GRP170, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 1, and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 6. Further characterization confirmed previously published finding that MANF is a cofactor of GRP78 interacting with its nucleotide binding domain. Using microscale thermophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we discovered that MANF is an ATP binding protein and that ATP blocks the MANF-GRP78 interaction. Interestingly, functional analysis of the antiapoptotic properties of MANF mutants in cultured neurons revealed divergent roles of MANF as a GRP78 cofactor and as an antiapoptotic regulator of UPR. We conclude that the co-factor type interaction with GRP78 is dispensable for the survival-promoting activity of MANF in neurons.	The cytoprotective protein MANF promotes neuronal survival independently from its role as a GRP78 cofactor.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33460648	Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver necrosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) in which APAP activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and specifically the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, leading to necrotic cell death. Previously, we have shown that receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1) knockdown is also protective against APAP RCD upstream of JNK. However, whether the kinase or platform function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP RCD is not known. To answer this question, we used genetic mouse models of targeted hepatocyte RIPK1 knockout (RIPK1(HepCKO)) or kinase dead knock-in (RIPK1(D138N)) and adult hepatocyte specific knockout of the cytoprotective protein A20 (A20(HepCKO)), known to interact with RIPK1, to study its potential involvement in MAPK signaling. We observed no difference in injury between WT and RIPK(1D138N) mice post APAP. However, RIPK1(HepCKO) was protective. We found that RIPK1(HepCKO) mice had attenuated pJNK activation, while A20 was simultaneously upregulated. Conversely, A20(HepCKO) markedly worsened liver injury from APAP. Mechanistically, we observed a significant upregulation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and increased JNK activation in A20(HepCKO) mice compared with littermate controls. We also demonstrated that A20 coimmunoprecipitated (co-IP) with both RIPK1 and ASK1, and that in the presence of RIPK1, there was less A20-ASK1 association than in its absence. We conclude that the kinase-independent platform function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP toxicity. Adult RIPK1(HepCKO) mice are protected against APAP by upregulating A20 and attenuating JNK signaling through ASK1, conversely, A20(HepCKO) worsens injury from APAP.	Interaction of RIPK1 and A20 modulates MAPK signaling in murine acetaminophen toxicity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33482198	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains various enzymes that metabolize fatty acids (FAs). Given that FAs are the components of membranes, FA metabolic enzymes might be associated with regulation of ER membrane functions. However, it remains unclear whether there is the interplay between FA metabolic enzymes and ER membrane proteins. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (TER) is an FA reductase present in the ER membrane and catalyzes the last step in the FA elongation cycle and sphingosine degradation pathway. Here we identify sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b), an ER Ca(2+) pump responsible for Ca(2+) accumulation in the ER, as a TER-binding protein by affinity purification from HEK293 cell lysates. We show that TER directly binds to SERCA2b by in vitro assays using recombinant proteins. Thapsigargin, a specific SERCA inhibitor, inhibits this binding. TER binds to SERCA2b through its conserved C-terminal region. TER overexpression suppresses SERCA2b ATPase activity in microsomal membranes of HEK293 cells. Depletion of TER increases Ca(2+) storage in the ER and accelerates SERCA2b-dependent Ca(2+) uptake to the ER after ligand-induced Ca(2+) release. Moreover, depletion of TER reduces the Ca(2+)-dependent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 4. These results demonstrate that TER is a negative regulator of SERCA2b, implying the direct linkage of FA metabolism and Ca(2+) accumulation in the ER.	Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase limits Ca(2+) accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum by inhibiting the Ca(2+) pump SERCA2b.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33482197	Ras genes are among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human malignancies. To date, there are no successful anticancer drugs in the clinic that target Ras proteins or their pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and characterize new components that regulate Ras activity or mediate its downstream signaling. To this end, we used a combination of affinity-pulldown and mass spectrometry to search for proteins that are physically associated with KRas. One of the top hits was Radil, a gene product with a Ras-association domain. Radil is known to be a downstream effector of Rap1, inhibiting RhoA signaling to regulate cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that Radil interacted with all three isoforms of Ras including HRas, NRas, and KRas, although it exhibited the strongest interaction with KRas. Moreover, Radil interacts with GTP-bound Ras more efficiently, suggesting a possibility that Radil may be involved in Ras activation. Supporting this, ectopic expression of Radil led to transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Radil knockdown resulted in weakened activation of Ras downstream signaling components, which was coupled with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and reduced expression of mesenchymal cell markers. Moreover, Radil knockdown greatly reduced the number of adhesion foci and depolymerized actin filaments, molecular processes that facilitate cancer cell migration. Taken together, our present studies strongly suggest that Radil is an important player for regulating Ras signaling, cell adhesion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and may provide new directions for Ras-related anticancer drug development.

33493519	Upregulation of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NTS) in a subgroup of lung cancers has been linked to poor prognosis. However, the regulatory pathway centered on NTS in lung cancer remains unclear. Here we identified the NTS-specific enhancer in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The AF4/FMR2 (AFF) family protein AFF1 occupies the NTS enhancer and inhibits NTS transcription. Clustering analysis of lung adenocarcinoma gene expression data demonstrated that NTS expression is highly positively correlated with the expression of the oncogenic factor CPS1. Detailed analyses demonstrated that the IL6 pathway antagonizes NTS in regulating CPS1. Thus, our analyses revealed a novel NTS-centered regulatory axis, consisting of AFF1 as a master transcription suppressor and IL6 as an antagonist in lung adenocarcinoma cells.

33548223	Neural cell adhesion molecules 1 (NCAM1) and 2 (NCAM2) belong to the cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily and have been shown to regulate formation, maturation, and maintenance of synapses. NCAM1 and NCAM2 undergo proteolysis, but the identity of all the proteases involved and how proteolysis is used to regulate their functions are not known. We report here that NCAM1 and NCAM2 are BACE1 substrates in vivo. NCAM1 and NCAM2 overexpressed in HEK cells were both cleaved by metalloproteinases or BACE1, and NCAM2 was also processed by gamma-secretase. We identified the BACE1 cleavage site of NCAM1 (at Glu 671) and NCAM2 (at Glu 663) using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. Next, we assessed BACE1-mediated processing of NCAM1 and NCAM2 in the mouse brain during aging. NCAM1 and NCAM2 were cleaved in the olfactory bulb of BACE1+/+ but not BACE1-/- mice at postnatal day 10 (P10), 4 and 12 months of age. In the hippocampus, a BACE1-specific soluble fragment of NCAM1 (sNCAM1beta) was only detected at P10. However, we observed an accumulation of full-length NCAM1 in hippocampal synaptosomes in 4-month-old BACE1-/- mice. We also found that polysialylated NCAM1 (PSA-NCAM1) levels were increased in BACE1-/- mice at P10 and demonstrated that BACE1 cleaves both NCAM1 and PSA-NCAM1 in vitro. In contrast, we did not find evidence for BACE1-dependent NCAM2 processing in the hippocampus at any age analyzed. In summary, our data demonstrate that BACE1 differentially processes NCAM1 and NCAM2 depending on the region of brain, subcellular localization, and age in vivo.

33567341	DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions that interfere with DNA metabolic processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination. USP11 deubiquitinase participates in DNA repair, but the role of USP11 in DPC repair is not known. SPRTN is a replication-coupled DNA-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves proteins cross-linked to DNA to promote DPC repair. SPRTN function is tightly regulated by a monoubiquitin switch that controls SPRTN auto-proteolysis and chromatin accessibility during DPC repair. Previously, VCPIP1 and USP7 deubiquitinases have been shown to regulate SPRTN. Here, we identify USP11 as an SPRTN deubiquitinase. USP11 interacts with SPRTN and cleaves monoubiquitinated SPRTN in cells and in vitro. USP11 depletion impairs SPRTN deubiquitination and promotes SPRTN auto-proteolysis in response to formaldehyde-induced DPCs. Loss of USP11 causes an accumulation of unrepaired DPCs and cellular hypersensitivity to treatment with DPC-inducing agents. Our findings show that USP11 regulates SPRTN auto-proteolysis and SPRTN-mediated DPC repair to maintain genome stability.

33571521	The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls organ size in animals via the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. It consists of a kinase cascade, in which MST1/2 and MAP4Ks phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ activity. A variety of signals can modulate LATS1/2 kinase activity to regulate Hippo pathway. However, the full mechanistic details of kinase-mediated regulation of Hippo pathway signaling remain elusive. Here, we report that TNF activates LATS1/2 and inhibits YAP/TAZ activity through MEKK2/3. Furthermore, MEKK2/3 act in parallel to MST1/2 and MAP4Ks to regulate LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ in response to various signals, such as serum and actin dynamics. Mechanistically, we show that MEKK2/3 interact with LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ and phosphorylate them. In addition, Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex associates with MEKK3 via CCM2 and CCM3 to inactivate MEKK3 kinase activity. Upstream signals of Hippo pathway trigger the dissociation of MEKK3 from STRIPAK complex to release MEKK3 activity. Our work has uncovered a previous unrecognized regulation of Hippo pathway via MEKK2/3 and provides new insights into molecular mechanisms for the interplay between Hippo-YAP and NF-kappaB signaling and the pathogenesis of cerebral cavernous malformations.	MEKK2 and MEKK3 orchestrate multiple signals to regulate Hippo pathway.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33577797	Components of the autophagy machinery are subject to regulation by various posttranslational modifications. Previous studies showed that monoubiquitination of LC3B catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin ligase BIRC6 targets LC3B for proteasomal degradation, thus reducing LC3B levels and autophagic activity under conditions of stress. However, mechanisms capable of counteracting this process are not known. Herein, we report that LC3B ubiquitination is reversed by the action of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10. We identified USP10 in a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen for ubiquitination-related genes that regulate LC3B levels. Biochemical analyses showed that silencing of USP10 reduces the levels of both the LC3B-I and LC3B-II forms of LC3B through increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In turn, the reduced LC3B levels result in slower degradation of the autophagy receptors SQSTM1 and NBR1 and an increased accumulation of puromycin-induced aggresome-like structures. Taken together, these findings indicate that the levels of LC3B and autophagic activity are controlled through cycles of LC3B ubiquitination and deubiquitination.	The ubiquitin isopeptidase USP10 deubiquitinates LC3B to increase LC3B levels and autophagic activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33581113	Ariadne-1 (Ari-1) is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase essential for neuronal development, but whose neuronal substrates are yet to be identified. To search for putative Ari-1 substrates, we used an in vivo ubiquitin biotinylation strategy coupled to quantitative proteomics of Drosophila heads. We identified 16 candidates that met the established criteria: a significant change of at least twofold increase on ubiquitination, with at least two unique peptides identified. Among those candidates, we identified Comatose (Comt), the homologue of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), which is involved in neurotransmitter release. Using a pull-down approach that relies on the overexpression and stringent isolation of a GFP-fused construct, we validate Comt/NSF to be an ubiquitination substrate of Ari-1 in fly neurons, resulting in the preferential monoubiquitination of Comt/NSF. We tested the possible functional relevance of this modification using Ari-1 loss-of-function mutants, which displayed a lower rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release due to failures at the presynaptic side. By contrast, evoked release in Ari-1 mutants was enhanced compared with controls in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner without modifications in the number of active zones, indicating that the probability of release per synapse is increased in these mutants. This phenotype distinction between spontaneous and evoked release suggests that NSF activity may discriminate between these two types of vesicle fusion. Our results thus provide a mechanism to regulate NSF activity in the synapse through Ari-1-dependent ubiquitination.	The ubiquitin ligase Ariadne-1 regulates neurotransmitter release via ubiquitination of NSF.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33587951	Induction of fetal hemoglobin to overcome adult beta-globin gene deficiency is an effective therapeutic strategy to ameliorate human beta-hemoglobinopathies. Previous work has revealed that fetal gamma-globin can be translationally induced via integrated stress signaling, but other studies have indicated that activating stress may eventually suppress gamma-globin expression transcriptionally. The mechanism by which gamma-globin expression is regulated at the translational level remains largely unknown, limiting our ability to determine whether activating stress is a realistic therapeutic option for these disorders. In this study, we performed a functional CRISPR screen targeting protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) to look for changes in gamma-globin expression in K562 cells. We not only discovered that several specific PRMTs may block gamma-globin transcription, but also revealed PRMT1 as a unique family member that is able to suppress gamma-globin synthesis specifically at the translational level. We further identified that a non-AUG uORF within the 5' untranslated region of gamma-globin serves as a barrier for translation, which is bypassed upon PRMT1 deficiency. Finally, we found that this novel mechanism of gamma-globin suppression could be pharmacologically targeted by the PRMT1 inhibitor, furamidine dihydrochloride. These data raise new questions regarding methyltransferase function and may offer a new therapeutic direction for beta-hemoglobinopathies.	The methyltransferase PRMT1 regulates gamma-globin translation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33609526	Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a multiorgan disorder caused by inactivation of the folliculin (FLCN) protein. Previously, we identified FLCN as a binding protein of Rab11A, a key regulator of the endocytic recycling pathway. This finding implies that the abnormal localization of specific proteins whose transport requires the FLCN-Rab11A complex may contribute to BHD. Here, we used human kidney-derived HEK293 cells as a model, and we report that FLCN promotes the binding of Rab11A with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is required for iron uptake through continuous trafficking between the cell surface and the cytoplasm. Loss of FLCN attenuated the Rab11A-TfR1 interaction, resulting in delayed recycling transport of TfR1. This delay caused an iron deficiency condition that induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity, which was reversed by iron supplementation. In a Drosophila model of BHD syndrome, we further demonstrated that the phenotype of BHD mutant larvae was substantially rescued by an iron-rich diet. These findings reveal a conserved function of FLCN in iron metabolism and may help to elucidate the mechanisms driving BHD syndrome.	FLCN regulates transferrin receptor 1 transport and iron homeostasis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33636181	The disease-initiating molecular events for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial retinal disease affecting many millions of elderly individuals worldwide, are still unknown. Of the over 30 risk and protective loci so far associated with AMD through whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) gene locus represents one of the most highly associated risk regions for AMD. A unique insertion/deletion (in/del) sequence located immediately upstream of the High Temperature Requirement A1 (HTRA1) gene in this region confers high risk for AMD. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we identified that two Gtf2i-beta/delta transcription factor isoforms bind to the cis-element 5'- ATTAATAACC-3' contained in this in/del sequence. The binding of these transcription factors leads to enhanced upregulation of transcription of the secretory serine protease HTRA1 in transfected cells and AMD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of Htra1 in mice using a CAG-promoter demonstrated increased blood concentration of Htra1 protein, caused upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and produced a choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-like phenotype. Finally, a comparison of 478 AMD patients to 481 healthy, age-matched controls from Japan, India, Australia, and the USA showed a statistically increased level of secreted HTRA1 blood concentration in AMD patients compared with age-matched controls. Taken together, these results suggest a common mechanism across ethnicities whereby increased systemic blood circulation of secreted serine protease HTRA1 leads to subsequent degradation of Bruch's membrane and eventual CNV in AMD.	Binding of Gtf2i-beta/delta transcription factors to the ARMS2 gene leads to increased circulating HTRA1 in AMD patients and in vitro.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33639163	The type II sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPT2A) mediates renal phosphate uptake. The NPT2A is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23, which requires Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1), a multidomain PDZ-containing phosphoprotein. Phosphocycling controls the association between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Here, we characterize the critical involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6A (GRK6A) in mediating PTH-sensitive phosphate transport by targeted phosphorylation coupled with NHERF1 conformational rearrangement, which in turn allows phosphorylation at a secondary site. GRK6A, through its carboxy-terminal PDZ recognition motif, binds NHERF1 PDZ1 with greater affinity than PDZ2. However, the association between NHERF1 PDZ2 and GRK6A is necessary for PTH action. Ser(162), a PKCalpha phosphorylation site in PDZ2, regulates the binding affinity between PDZ2 and GRK6A. Substitution of Ser(162) with alanine (S(162)A) blocks the PTH action but does not disrupt the interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Replacement of Ser(162) with aspartic acid (S(162)D) abrogates the interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A and concurrently PTH action. We used amber codon suppression to generate a phosphorylated Ser(162)(pSer(162))-PDZ2 variant. KD values determined by fluorescence anisotropy indicate that incorporation of pSer(162) increased the binding affinity to the carboxy terminus of GRK6A 2-fold compared with WT PDZ2. Molecular dynamics simulations predict formation of an electrostatic network between pSer(162) and Asp(183) of PDZ2 and Arg at position -1 of the GRK6A PDZ-binding motif. Our results suggest that PDZ2 plays a regulatory role in PTH-sensitive NPT2A-mediated phosphate transport and phosphorylation of Ser(162) in PDZ2 modulates the interaction with GRK6A.	Multisite NHERF1 phosphorylation controls GRK6A regulation of hormone-sensitive phosphate transport.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33640455	DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genome stability primarily by correcting replication errors. MMR deficiency can lead to cancer development and bolsters cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. However, recent studies have shown that checkpoint blockade therapy is effective in MMR-deficient cancers, thus the ability to identify cancer etiology would greatly benefit cancer treatment. MutS homolog 2 (MSH2) is an obligate subunit of mismatch recognition proteins MutSalpha (MSH2-MSH6) and MutSbeta (MSH2-MSH3). Precise regulation of MSH2 is critical, as either over- or underexpression of MSH2 results in an increased mutation frequency. The mechanism by which cells maintain MSH2 proteostasis is unknown. Using functional ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays, we show that the ovarian tumor (OTU) family deubiquitinase ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 (OTUB1) inhibits MSH2 ubiquitination by blocking the E2 ligase ubiquitin transfer activity. Depleting OTUB1 in cells promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MSH2, leading to greater mutation frequency and cellular resistance to genotoxic agents, including the common chemotherapy agents N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and cisplatin. Taken together, our data identify OTUB1 as an important regulator of MSH2 stability and provide evidence that OTUB1 is a potential biomarker for cancer etiology and therapy.

33647318	Vascular calcification is the ectopic deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite minerals in arterial wall, which involves the transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) toward an osteogenic phenotype. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating the VSMC osteogenic switch remain incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in vascular calcification. miRNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified miR-223-3p as a candidate miRNA in calcified mouse aortas. MiR-223-3p knockout aggravated calcification in both medial and atherosclerotic vascular calcification models. Further, RNA-seq transcriptome analysis verified JAK-STAT and PPAR signaling pathways were upregulated in both medial and atherosclerotic calcified aortas. Overlapping genes in these signaling pathways with predicted target genes of miR-223-3p derived from miRNA databases, we identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential target gene of miR-223-3p in vascular calcification. In vitro experiments showed that miR-223-3p blocked interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing the osteogenic switch and calcification of VSMCs. In contrast, overexpression of STAT3 diminished the effect of miR-223-3p. Taken together, the results indicate a protective role of miR-223-3p that inhibits both medial and atherosclerotic vascular calcification by regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling-mediated VSMC transdifferentiation.	MicroRNA-223-3p inhibits vascular calcification and the osteogenic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33647316	Mutations in the human gene encoding the neuron-specific Eag1 voltage-gated K(+) channel are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, indicating an important role of Eag1 during brain development. A disease-causing Eag1 mutation is linked to decreased protein stability that involves enhanced protein degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7). The general mechanisms governing protein homeostasis of plasma membrane- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Eag1 K(+) channels, however, remain unclear. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified another E3 ubiquitin ligase, makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), as a novel binding partner primarily interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of Eag1. MKRN1 mainly interacts with ER-localized immature core-glycosylated, as well as nascent nonglycosylated, Eag1 proteins. MKRN1 promotes polyubiquitination and ER-associated proteasomal degradation of immature Eag1 proteins. Although both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to ER quality control of immature core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins, MKRN1, but not CUL7, associates with and promotes degradation of nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins at the ER. In direct contrast to the role of CUL7 in regulating both ER and peripheral quality controls of Eag1, MKRN1 is exclusively responsible for the early stage of Eag1 maturation at the ER. We further demonstrated that both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to protein quality control of additional disease-causing Eag1 mutants associated with defective protein homeostasis. Our data suggest that the presence of this dual ubiquitination system differentially maintains Eag1 protein homeostasis and may ensure efficient removal of disease-associated misfolded Eag1 mutant channels.	Identification of MKRN1 as a second E3 ligase for Eag1 potassium channels reveals regulation via differential degradation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33647315	Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. Pannexin1 (PANX1), a member of the pannexin family of channel-forming glycoproteins, regulates cellular processes in melanoma cells including proliferation, migration, and invasion/metastasis. However, the mechanisms responsible for coordinating and regulating PANX1 function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of PANX1 and the N-terminal portion of beta-catenin, a key transcription factor in the Wnt pathway. At the protein level, beta-catenin was significantly decreased when PANX1 was either knocked down or inhibited by two PANX1 blockers, Probenecid and Spironolactone. Immunofluorescence imaging showed a disrupted pattern of beta-catenin localization at the cell membrane in PANX1-deficient cells, and transcription of several Wnt target genes, including MITF, was suppressed. In addition, a mitochondrial stress test revealed that the metabolism of PANX1-deficient cells was impaired, indicating a role for PANX1 in the regulation of the melanoma cell metabolic profile. Taken together, our data show that PANX1 directly interacts with beta-catenin to modulate growth and metabolism in melanoma cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into PANX1-mediated melanoma progression and may be applicable to other contexts where PANX1 and beta-catenin interact as a potential new component of the Wnt signaling pathway.

33667549	Human embryonic stem cells are a type of pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that are used to investigate their differentiation into diverse mature cell types for molecular studies. The mechanisms underlying insulin receptor (IR)-mediated signaling in the maintenance of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) identity and cell fate specification are not fully understood. Here, we used two independent shRNAs to stably knock down IRs in two hPSC lines that represent pluripotent stem cells and explored the consequences on expression of key proteins in pathways linked to proliferation and differentiation. We consistently observed lowered pAKT in contrast to increased pERK1/2 and a concordant elevation in pluripotency gene expression. ERK2 chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assays, and ERK1/2 inhibitors established direct causality between ERK1/2 and OCT4 expression. Of importance, RNA sequencing analyses indicated a dysregulation of genes involved in cell differentiation and organismal development. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses further confirmed a global downregulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Subsequent differentiation toward the neural lineage reflected alterations in SOX1(+)PAX6(+) neuroectoderm and FOXG1(+) cortical neuron marker expression and protein localization. Collectively, our data underscore the role of IR-mediated signaling in maintaining pluripotency, the extracellular matrix necessary for the stem cell niche, and regulating cell fate specification including the neural lineage.	Defective insulin receptor signaling in hPSCs skews pluripotency and negatively perturbs neural differentiation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33667543	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) secreted by a variety of cell types are known to play essential roles in cell differentiation and matrix formation in the bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessel, and neuronal tissue. BMPs activate intracellular effectors via C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad9, which relay the signaling by forming a complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus for transcriptional activation. Smad6 inhibits BMP signaling through diverse mechanisms operative at the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear levels. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of Smad6 functional diversity remain unclear. Here, using a biochemical approach and cell differentiation systems, we report a cytosolic mechanism of action for Smad6 that requires arginine methylation at arginine 81 (R81) and functions through association with Smad1 and interference with the formation of Smad1-Smad4 complexes. By mutating the methylated arginine residue, R81, and by silencing the expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1, we show that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 catalyzes R81 methylation of Smad6 upon BMP treatment, R81 methylation subsequently facilitates Smad6 interaction with the phosphorylated active Smad1, and R81 methylation facilitates Smad6-mediated interruption of Smad1-Smad4 complex formation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, Smad6 WT but not the methylation-deficient R81A mutant inhibited BMP-responsive transcription, attenuated BMP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, and antagonized BMP-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that R81 methylation plays an essential role in Smad6-mediated inhibition of BMP responses.	Arginine methylation of R81 in Smad6 confines BMP-induced Smad1 signaling.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33676897	F-box proteins beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 are paralogs present in the human genome. They control several cellular processes including cell cycle and DNA damage signaling. Moreover, it is reported that they facilitate DNA damage-induced accumulation of p53 by directing proteasomal degradation of MDM2, a protein that promotes p53 degradation. However, the individual roles of beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 in the genotoxic stress-induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow cytometric, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 communicate during genotoxic stress. We found that expression levels of beta-TrCP1 are significantly increased while levels of beta-TrCP2 are markedly decreased upon induction of genotoxic stress. Further, our results revealed that DNA damage-induced activation of ATM kinase plays an important role in maintaining the reciprocal expression levels of beta-TrCP1 and beta-TrCP2 via the phosphorylation of beta-TrCP1 at Ser158. Phosphorylated beta-TrCP1 potently promotes the proteasomal degradation of beta-TrCP2 and MDM2, resulting in the activation of p53. Additionally, beta-TrCP1 impedes MDM2 accumulation via abrogation of its lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination by beta-TrCP2. Thus, beta-TrCP1 helps to arrest cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and promotes DNA repair upon DNA damage through attenuation of beta-TrCP2. Collectively, our findings elucidate an intriguing posttranslational regulatory mechanism of these two paralogs under genotoxic stress and revealed beta-TrCP1 as a key player in maintaining the genome integrity through the attenuation of beta-TrCP2 levels in response to genotoxic stress.	beta-TrCP1 facilitates cell cycle checkpoint activation, DNA repair, and cell survival through ablation of beta-TrCP2 in response to genotoxic stress.

33676896	The C1q and TNF related 4 (C1QTNF4) protein is a structurally unique member of the C1QTNF family, a family of secreted proteins that have structural homology with both complement C1q and the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. C1QTNF4 has been linked to the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus through genetic studies; however, its role in immunity and inflammation remains poorly defined and a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 has yet to be identified. Here we report identification of nucleolin as a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 using mass spectrometric analysis. Additionally, we present evidence that the interaction between C1QTNF4 and nucleolin is mediated by the second C1q-like domain of C1QTNF4 and the C terminus of nucleolin. We show that monocytes and B cells are target cells of C1QTNF4 and observe extensive binding to dead cells. Imaging flow cytometry experiments in monocytes show that C1QTNF4 becomes actively internalized upon cell binding. Our results suggest that nucleolin may serve as a docking molecule for C1QTNF4 and act in a context-dependent manner through coreceptors. Taken together, these findings further our understanding of C1QTNF4's function in the healthy immune system and how dysfunction may contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus.

33676894	The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 plays important roles in the repolarization of atrial action potentials and regulation of the vascular tone. While the modulation of Kv1.5 function has been well studied, less is known about how the protein levels of Kv1.5 on the cell membrane are regulated. Here, through electrophysiological and biochemical analyses of Kv1.5 channels heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, as well as native Kv1.5 in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes, we found that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM) diminished Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5) and protein levels of Kv1.5 in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, PKC activation led to monoubiquitination and degradation of the mature Kv1.5 proteins. Overexpression of Vps24, a protein that sorts transmembrane proteins into lysosomes via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, accelerated, whereas the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 completely prevented PKC-mediated Kv1.5 degradation. Kv1.5, but not Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, or Kv1.4, was uniquely sensitive to PMA treatment. Sequence alignments suggested that residues within the N terminus of Kv1.5 are essential for PKC-mediated Kv1.5 reduction. Using N-terminal truncation as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that Thr15 is the target site for PKC that mediates endocytic degradation of Kv1.5 channels. These findings indicate that alteration of protein levels in the plasma membrane represents an important regulatory mechanism of Kv1.5 channel function under PKC activation conditions.	Kv1.5 channels are regulated by PKC-mediated endocytic degradation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33676893	Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are structurally similar proteins that primarily mediate the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling responsible for driving cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The dynamics of the Smad2/3 phosphorylation provide the key mechanism for regulating the TGF-beta signaling pathway, but the details surrounding this phosphorylation remain unclear. Here, using in vitro kinase assay coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified for the first time that nemo-like kinase (NLK) regulates TGF-beta signaling via modulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the linker region. TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional and cellular responses are suppressed by NLK overexpression, whereas NLK depletion exerts opposite effects. Specifically, we discovered that NLK associates with Smad3 and phosphorylates the designated serine residues located in the linker region of Smad2 and Smad3, which inhibits phosphorylation at the C terminus, thereby decreasing the duration of TGF-beta signaling. Overall, this work demonstrates that phosphorylation on the linker region of Smad2/3 by NLK counteracts the canonical phosphorylation in response to TGF-beta signals, thus providing new insight into the mechanisms governing TGF-beta signaling transduction.	The phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 linker region by nemo-like kinase regulates TGF-beta signaling.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33676892	Cells can switch between Rac1 (lamellipodia-based) and RhoA (blebbing-based) migration modes, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this shift are not fully understood. Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKzeta), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid, forms independent complexes with Rac1 and RhoA, selectively dissociating each from their common inhibitor RhoGDI. DGKzeta catalytic activity is required for Rac1 dissociation but is dispensable for RhoA dissociation; instead, DGKzeta stimulates RhoA release via a kinase-independent scaffolding mechanism. The molecular determinants that mediate the selective targeting of DGKzeta to Rac1 or RhoA signaling complexes are unknown. Here, we show that protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha)-mediated phosphorylation of the DGKzeta MARCKS domain increased DGKzeta association with RhoA and decreased its interaction with Rac1. The same modification also enhanced DGKzeta interaction with the scaffold protein syntrophin. Expression of a phosphomimetic DGKzeta mutant stimulated membrane blebbing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts, which was augmented by inhibition of endogenous Rac1. DGKzeta expression in differentiated C2 myotubes, which have low endogenous Rac1 levels, also induced substantial membrane blebbing via the RhoA-ROCK pathway. These events were independent of DGKzeta catalytic activity, but dependent upon a functional C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Rescue of RhoA activity in DGKzeta-null cells also required the PDZ-binding motif, suggesting that syntrophin interaction is necessary for optimal RhoA activation. Collectively, our results define a switch-like mechanism whereby DGKzeta phosphorylation by PKCalpha plays a role in the interconversion between Rac1 and RhoA signaling pathways that underlie different cellular migration modes.	PKCalpha-mediated phosphorylation of the diacylglycerol kinase zeta MARCKS domain switches cell migration modes by regulating interactions with Rac1 and RhoA.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33713703	Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits gene expression homeostasis, which is defined as the buffering of transcription levels against changes in DNA copy number during the S phase of the cell cycle. It has been suggested that S. cerevisiae employs an active mechanism to maintain gene expression homeostasis through Rtt109-Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56). Here, we show that gene expression homeostasis can be achieved independently of H3K56 acetylation by Tos4 (Target of Swi6-4). Using Nanostring technology, we establish that Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis depends on its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is a phosphopeptide recognition domain required to bind histone deacetylases (HDACs). We demonstrate that the mechanism of Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis requires its interaction with the Rpd3L HDAC complex. However, this is independent of Rpd3's well-established roles in both histone deacetylation and controlling the DNA replication timing program, as established by deep sequencing of Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorted (FACS) S and G2 phase populations. Overall, our data reveals that Tos4 mediates gene expression homeostasis through its FHA domain-dependent interaction with the Rpd3L complex, which is independent of H3K56ac.	Tos4 mediates gene expression homeostasis through interaction with HDAC complexes independently of H3K56 acetylation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33722609	The functions of long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, such as MEG3, are defined by their interactions with other RNAs and proteins. These interactions, in turn, are shaped by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is important to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving cellular architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to its recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by disrupting the interaction of p53 with mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2). To test this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, a single-molecule localization microscopy technique, to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo algorithm to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for our method was obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR, MEG3 and p53, and Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support a model in which MEG3 modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2.

33722608	The present study aimed to explore specific mechanisms involved in mediating the neuroprotective effects of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) in cerebral ischemic injury. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated neuron model were developed. The expression of Smurf2, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1alpha), and DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 gene (DDIT4) was analyzed. Thereafter, the expression of Smurf2, YY1, HIF1alpha, and DDIT4 was altered in the MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. Apoptosis in tissues and cerebral infarction were assessed. In neurons, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, viability, and apoptosis were assessed, followed by evaluation of lactate dehydrogenase leakage rate. The interaction between Smurf2 and YY1 was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assay and that between YY1 ubiquitination by in vivo ubiquitination experiment. The results showed downregulation of Smurf2 and upregulation of YY1, HIF1alpha, and DDIT4 in both MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. Smurf2 elevated YY1 ubiquitination and degradation, and YY1 increased HIF1alpha expression to promote DDIT4 in neurons. Overexpressed Smurf2 or downregulated YY1, HIF1alpha, or DDIT4 reduced the volume of cerebral infarction and apoptosis in MCAO mice, while enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis and lactate dehydrogenase leakage in OGD-treated neurons. In summary, our findings elucidated a neuroprotective role of Smurf2 in cerebral ischemic injury via inactivation of the YY1/HIF1alpha/DDIT4 axis.

33722606	Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute to the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), including Type IV collagen, in the vessel wall. ECMs coordinate communication among different cell types, but mechanisms underlying this communication remain unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is activated and contributes to VSMC phenotypic transition in response to vascular injury. In this study, we investigated the participation of XBP1 in the communication between VSMCs and vascular progenitor cells (VPCs). Immunofluorescence and immunohistology staining revealed that Xbp1 gene was essential for type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1) expression during mouse embryonic development and vessel wall ECM deposition and stem cell antigen 1-positive (Sca1(+))-VPC recruitment in response to vascular injury. The Western blot analysis elucidated an Xbp1 gene dose-dependent effect on COL4A1 expression and that the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) increased protease-mediated COL4A1 degradation as revealed by Zymography. RT-PCR analysis revealed that XBP1s in VSMCs not only upregulated COL4A1/2 transcription but also induced the occurrence of a novel transcript variant, soluble type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1s), in which the front part of exon 4 is joined with the rear part of exon 42. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation, DNA/protein pulldown and in vitro transcription demonstrated that XBP1s binds to exon 4 and exon 42, directing the transcription from exon 4 to exon 42. This leads to transcription complex bypassing the internal sequences, producing a shortened COL4A1s protein that increased Sca1(+)-VPC migration. Taken together, these results suggest that activated VSMCs may recruit Sca1(+)-VPCs via XBP1s-mediated COL4A1s secretion, leading to vascular injury repair or neointima formation.	X-box binding protein 1-mediated COL4A1s secretion regulates communication between vascular smooth muscle and stem/progenitor cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33741342	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling promotes cancer progression. In particular, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-beta is considered crucial to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Here, we report that the EMT-associated cellular responses induced by TGF-beta are mediated by distinct signaling pathways that diverge at Smad3. By expressing chimeric Smad1/Smad3 proteins in SMAD3 knockout A549 cells, we found that the beta4 region in the Smad3 MH1 domain is essential for TGF-beta-induced cell motility, but is not essential for other EMT-associated responses including epithelial marker downregulation. TGF-beta was previously reported to enhance cell motility by activating Rac1 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Intriguingly, TGF-beta-dependent signaling mediated by Smad3's beta4 region causes the downregulation of multiple mRNAs that encode GTPase activating proteins that target Rac1 (ARHGAPs), thereby attenuating Rac1 inactivation. Therefore, two independent pathways downstream of TGF-beta type I receptor contribute cooperatively to sustained Rac1 activation, thereby leading to enhanced cell motility.	TGF-beta-induced cell motility requires downregulation of ARHGAPs to sustain Rac1 activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33744286	The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a central role in inflammation. The GR activity is also modulated via protein-protein interactions, including binding of 14-3-3 proteins induced by GR phosphorylation. However, the specific phosphorylation sites on the GR that trigger these interactions and their functional consequences are less clear. Hence, we sought to examine this system in more detail. We used phosphorylated GR peptides, biophysical studies, and X-ray crystallography to identify key residues within the ligand-binding domain of the GR, T524 and S617, whose phosphorylation results in binding of the representative 14-3-3 protein 14-3-3zeta. A kinase screen identified misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) as responsible for phosphorylating T524 and Rho-associated protein kinase 1 for phosphorylating S617; cell-based approaches confirmed the importance of both GR phosphosites and MINK1 but not Rho-associated protein kinase 1 alone in inducing GR-14-3-3 binding. Together our results provide molecular-level insight into 14-3-3-mediated regulation of the GR and highlight both MINK1 and the GR-14-3-3 axis as potential targets for future therapeutic intervention.	Glucocorticoid receptor Thr524 phosphorylation by MINK1 induces interactions with 14-3-3 protein regulators.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33745968	The phosphatase cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) regulates cell cycle progression. Increased Cdc25B levels are often detected in cancer cell lines and human cancers and have been implicated in contributing to tumor growth, potentially by providing cancer cells with the ability to bypass checkpoint controls. However, the specific mechanism by which increased Cdc25B impacts tumor progression is not clear. Here we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found that patients with high CDC25B expression had the expected poor survival. However, we also found that high CDC25B expression had a p53-dependent tumor suppressive effect in lung cancer and possibly several other cancer types. Looking in more detail at the tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B, we found that increased Cdc25B expression caused inhibition of cell growth in human normal fibroblasts. This effect was not due to alteration of specific cell cycle stage or inhibition of apoptosis, nor by induction of the DNA damage response. Instead, increased CDC25B expression led cells into senescence. We also found that p53 was required to induce senescence, which might explain the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B. Mechanistically, we found that the Cdc25B phosphatase activity was required to induce senescence. Further analysis also found that Cdc25B stabilized p53 through binding and dephosphorylating p53. Together, this study identified a tumor-suppressive function of Cdc25B that is mediated through a p53-dependent senescence pathway.	CDC25B induces cellular senescence and correlates with tumor suppression in a p53-dependent manner.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33766559	In eukaryotes, various alternative translation initiation mechanisms have been unveiled for the translation of specific mRNAs. Some do not conform to the conventional scanning-initiation model. Translation initiation of histone H4 mRNA combines both canonical (cap-dependent) and viral initiation strategies (no-scanning, internal recruitment of initiation factors). Specific H4 mRNA structures tether the translation machinery directly onto the initiation codon and allow massive production of histone H4 during the S phase of the cell cycle. The human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), composed of 13 subunits (a-m), was shown to selectively recruit and control the expression of several cellular mRNAs. Whether eIF3 mediates H4 mRNA translation remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that eIF3 binds to a stem-loop structure (eIF3-BS) located in the coding region of H4 mRNA. Combining cross-linking and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation experiments in vivo and in vitro, we also found that eIF3 binds to H1, H2A, H2B, and H3 histone mRNAs. We identified direct contacts between eIF3c, d, e, g subunits, and histone mRNAs but observed distinct interaction patterns to each histone mRNA. Our results show that eIF3 depletion in vivo reduces histone mRNA binding and modulates histone neosynthesis, suggesting that synthesis of histones is sensitive to the levels of eIF3. Thus, we provide evidence that eIF3 acts as a regulator of histone translation.	eIF3 interacts with histone H4 messenger RNA to regulate its translation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33766558	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a fundamental signaling pathway that regulates cell fate decisions in response to external stimuli. Several scaffold proteins bind directly to kinase components of this pathway and regulate their activation by growth factors. One of the best studied MAPK scaffolds is kinase suppressor of Ras1 (KSR1), which is induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to translocate to the plasma membrane where it activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). While Ca(2+) has been shown to modulate MAPK signaling, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Ca(2+) alters MAPK activity at least in part via KSR1. Using several approaches, including fusion proteins, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a cell-permeable chemical inhibitor, we investigated the functional interaction between KSR1 and calmodulin. In vitro analysis with pure proteins reveals that calmodulin binds directly to KSR1. Moreover, endogenous calmodulin and KSR1 co-immunoprecipitate from mammalian cell lysates. Importantly, Ca(2+) is required for the association between calmodulin and KSR1, both in vitro and in cells. The cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B significantly reduced activation of ERK by EGF in mouse embryo fibroblasts that overexpress KSR1, but not in control cells. Moreover, CGS9343B impaired the ability of EGF to induce KSR1 translocation to the plasma membrane and to stimulate formation of KSR1-ERK and KSR1-pERK (phosphorylated ERK) complexes in cells. Collectively, our data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the scaffold protein KSR1 couples Ca(2+) and calmodulin signaling to the MAPK cascade.	Calmodulin influences MAPK signaling by binding KSR1.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33781742	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a natural multifunctional phospholipid, is highly increased in plasma from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and mediates proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) by activating the Notch3 signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underpinning S1P-mediated induction of PASMCs proliferation remain unclear. In this study, using biochemical and molecular biology approaches, RNA interference and gene expression analyses, 5'-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we demonstrated that S1P promoted the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), and subsequently upregulated the expression of the microRNA miR-135b, which further reduced the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-transduction repeat-containing protein and led to a reduction in yes-associated protein (YAP) ubiquitinated degradation in PASMCs. YAP is the core effector of the Hippo pathway and mediates the expression of particular genes. The accumulation of YAP further increased the expression and activation of Notch3 and ultimately promoted the proliferation of PASMCs. In addition, we showed that preblocking S1PR2, prior silencing of STAT3, miR-135b, or YAP, and prior inhibition of Notch3 all attenuated S1P-induced PASMCs proliferation. Taken together, our study indicates that S1P stimulates PASMCs proliferation by activation of the S1PR2/STAT3/miR-135b/beta-transduction repeat-containing protein/YAP/Notch3 pathway, and our data suggest that targeting this cascade might have potential value in ameliorating PASMCs hyperproliferation and benefit pulmonary arterial hypertension.

33789160	The membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are synthesized de novo by the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway, in which the extracellular substrates choline and ethanolamine are transported into the cell, phosphorylated, and coupled with diacylglycerol to form the final phospholipid product. Although multiple transport systems have been established for choline, ethanolamine transport is poorly characterized and there is no single protein assigned a transport function for ethanolamine. The solute carriers 44A (SLC44A) known as choline transporter-like proteins-1 and -2 (CTL1 and CTL2) are choline transporter at the plasma membrane and mitochondria. We report a novel function of CTL1 and CTL2 in ethanolamine transport. Using the lack or the gain of gene function in combination with specific antibodies and transport inhibitors we established two distinct ethanolamine transport systems of a high affinity, mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity, mediated by CTL2. Both transporters are Na(+)-independent ethanolamine/H(+) antiporters. Primary human fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations in the CTL1 gene (M1= SLC44A1(DeltaAsp517) and M2= SLC44A1(DeltaSer126)) are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of CTL1 in M2 cells reduced the ethanolamine transport, the flux through the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway, and PE synthesis. In contrast, overexpression of CTL1 in M2 cells improved ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. These data firmly establish that CTL1 and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in whole cells and mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the Kennedy pathway and intracellular redistribution of ethanolamine.	Choline transporter-like proteins 1 and 2 are newly identified plasma membrane and mitochondrial ethanolamine transporters.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33811860	Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption. Traditional drugs for treating osteoporosis are associated with serious side effects, and thus, new treatment methods are required. This study investigated the role of differentially expressed microRNAs during osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast activity during osteoarthritis as well as the associated underlying mechanisms. We used a microarray to screen microRNAs that decreased in the process of osteoclast differentiation and verified miR-21-5p to decrease significantly using RT-qPCR. In follow-up experiments, we found that miR-21-5p targets SKP2 to regulate osteoclast differentiation. In vivo, ovariectomized mice were used to simulate perimenopausal osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency, and miR-21-5p treatment inhibited bone resorption and maintained bone cortex and trabecular structure. These results suggest that miR-21-5p is a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis.	miR-21-5p targets SKP2 to reduce osteoclastogenesis in a mouse model of osteoporosis.

33811857	The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol and cholesterol ester (CE) into cells. SR-B1 is subject to posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1 (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1 +/- GIPC1 overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues. Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes.	The adaptor protein GIPC1 stabilizes the scavenger receptor SR-B1 and increases its cholesterol uptake.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33857479	Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a predominantly nuclear RNA-binding protein with key functions in RNA processing and DNA damage repair. Defects in nuclear import of FUS have been linked to severe neurodegenerative diseases; hence, it is of great interest to understand this process and how it is dysregulated in disease. Transportin-1 (TNPO1) and the closely related transportin-2 have been identified as major nuclear import receptors of FUS. They bind to the C-terminal nuclear localization signal of FUS and mediate the protein's nuclear import and at the same time also suppress aberrant phase transitions of FUS in the cytoplasm. Whether FUS can utilize other nuclear transport receptors for the purpose of import and chaperoning has not been examined so far. Here, we show that FUS directly binds to different import receptors in vitro. FUS formed stable complexes not only with TNPO1 but also with transportin-3, importin beta, importin 7, or the importin beta/7 heterodimer. Binding of these alternative import receptors required arginine residues within FUS-RG/RGG motifs and was weakened by arginine methylation. Interaction with these importins suppressed FUS phase separation and reduced its sequestration into stress granules. In a permeabilized cell system, we further showed that transportin-3 had the capacity to import FUS into the nucleus, albeit with lower efficiency than TNPO1. Our data suggest that aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins such as FUS may utilize a network of importins for chaperoning and import, similar to histones and ribosomal proteins.	The RNA-binding protein FUS is chaperoned and imported into the nucleus by a network of import receptors.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33865858	Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane proteases, is involved in the activation of the sigma(E) extracytoplasmic stress response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.	The Escherichia coli S2P intramembrane protease RseP regulates ferric citrate uptake by cleaving the sigma factor regulator FecR.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33865857	Human cell division is a highly regulated process that relies on the accurate capture and movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Errors in the fidelity of chromosome congression and alignment can lead to improper chromosome segregation, which is correlated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. These processes are known to be regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in other species, but the role of ERK2 in mitosis in mammals remains unclear. Here, we have identified the dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7), known to display selectivity for ERK2, as important in regulating chromosome alignment. During mitosis, DUSP7 bound to ERK2 and regulated the abundance of active phospho-ERK2 through its phosphatase activity. Overexpression of DUSP7, but not catalytically inactive mutants, led to a decrease in the levels of phospho-ERK2 and mitotic chromosome misalignment, while knockdown of DUSP7 also led to defective chromosome congression that resulted in a prolonged mitosis. Consistently, knockdown or chemical inhibition of ERK2 or chemical inhibition of the MEK kinase that phosphorylates ERK2 led to chromosome alignment defects. Our results support a model wherein MEK-mediated phosphorylation and DUSP7-mediated dephosphorylation regulate the levels of active phospho-ERK2 to promote proper cell division.	DUSP7 regulates the activity of ERK2 to promote proper chromosome alignment during cell division.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33872597	TBC1D4 is a 160 kDa multidomain Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) and a downstream target of the insulin- and contraction-activated kinases AKT and AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 has been linked to translocation of GLUT4 from storage vesicles (GSVs) to the cell surface. However, its impact on enzymatic activity is not well understood, as previous studies mostly investigated the truncated GAP domain lacking the known phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we expressed and purified recombinant full-length TBC1D4 using a baculovirus system. Size-exclusion chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length TBC1D4 forms oligomers of approximately 600 kDa. Compared with the truncated GAP domain, full-length TBC1D4 displayed similar substrate specificity, but had a markedly higher specific GAP activity toward Rab10. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we mapped 19 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in TBC1D4. We determined Michaelis-Menten kinetics using in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified kinases and stable isotope-labeled gamma-[(18)O4]-ATP. These data revealed that Ser(324) (KM approximately 6 muM) and Thr(649) (KM approximately 25 muM) were preferential sites for phosphorylation by AKT, whereas Ser(348), Ser(577), Ser(595) (KM approximately 10 muM), Ser(711) (KM approximately 79 muM), and Ser(764) were found to be preferred targets for AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by AKT or AMPK did not alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity, but did disrupt interaction with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a resident protein of GSVs implicated in GLUT4 trafficking. These findings provide evidence that insulin and contraction may regulate TBC1D4 function primarily by disrupting the recruitment of the RabGAP to GLUT4 vesicles.	AKT/AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 disrupts the interaction with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33894203	Protein aggregation is the abnormal association of misfolded proteins into larger, often insoluble structures that can be toxic during aging and in protein aggregation-associated diseases. Previous research has established a role for the cytosolic Tsa1 peroxiredoxin in responding to protein misfolding stress. Tsa1 is also known to downregulate the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway as part of the response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in protein misfolding stress is not known. Using transcriptomics, we examined the response to protein misfolding stress and found upregulation of numerous stress gene functions and downregulation of many genes related to protein synthesis and other growth-related processes consistent with the well-characterized environmental stress response. The scope of the transcriptional response is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains, but the magnitude is dampened in the strain lacking Tsa1. We identified a direct protein interaction between Tsa1 and the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is present under normal growth conditions and explains the observed differences in gene expression profiles. This interaction is increased in a redox-dependent manner in response to nascent protein misfolding, via Tsa1-mediated oxidation of Bcy1. Oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens PKA pathway activity, leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression. Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA provides a mechanism to mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to stress caused by exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species.	Tolerance to nascent protein misfolding stress requires fine-tuning of the cAMP/PKA pathway.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33894201	Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor that binds substrate proteins and facilitates their proteasomal degradation. Most SPOP substrates present multiple SPOP-binding (SB) motifs and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation with SPOP. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), an insulin transcription factor, is downregulated by interaction with SPOP. Unlike other substrates, only one SB motif has previously been reported within the Pdx1 C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (Pdx1-C). Given this difference, we aimed to determine the specific mode of interaction of Pdx1 with SPOP and how it is similar or different to that of other SPOP substrates. Here, we identify a second SB motif in Pdx1-C, but still find that the resulting moderate valency is insufficient to support phase separation with SPOP in cells. Although Pdx1 does not phase separate with SPOP, Pdx1 and SPOP interaction prompts SPOP relocalization from nuclear speckles to the diffuse nucleoplasm. Accordingly, we find that SPOP-mediated ubiquitination activity of Pdx1 occurs in the nucleoplasm and that highly efficient Pdx1 turnover requires both SB motifs. Our results suggest that the subnuclear localization of SPOP-substrate interactions and substrate ubiquitination may be directed by the properties of the substrate itself.	Intrinsically disordered substrates dictate SPOP subnuclear localization and ubiquitination activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33895141	Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a critical transcription factor that orchestrates cellular responses to oxidative stress. Because the dysregulation of Nrf2 has been implicated in many diseases, precise regulation of its protein level is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and WD40 repeat protein 23 (WDR23) directly regulate Nrf2 levels via similar but distinct proteasome-dependent pathways. WDR23 forms a part of the WDR23-Cullin 4A-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4A(WDR23)), whereas Keap1 serves as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin 3-containing ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the mechanisms underlying crosstalk between these Keap1 and WDR23 pathways for the regulation of Nrf2 levels have not been investigated. Here, we showed that knockdown (KD) of Keap1 upregulated the expression of Cullin4A (CUL4A) in a specificity protein 1 (Sp1)-dependent manner. We also revealed that Sp1 interacted with Keap1, leading to ubiquitination of Sp1. Increases in Sp1 by Keap1 KD triggered Sp1 binding to the fourth Sp1 binding site (Sp1_M4) within the -230/+50 region of the CUL4A gene. We also demonstrated that the overexpression and KD of Sp1 reduced and increased Nrf2 protein levels, respectively. These effects were abrogated by the WDR23 KD, suggesting that Sp1 also regulates Nrf2 levels via the ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4A(WDR23). In conclusion, we discovered Sp1 as a novel substrate of Keap1 and provided evidence that Sp1 regulates the expression of CUL4A. We revealed a novel role for Sp1 in mediating crosstalk between two independent regulators of Nrf2 protein levels.	Sp1 is a substrate of Keap1 and regulates the activity of CRL4A(WDR23) ubiquitin ligase toward Nrf2.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33901493	miRNAs are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. The post-transcriptional maturation of miRNAs is controlled by the Drosha-DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) microprocessor. Dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including cancers. C-terminal-binding protein-interacting protein (CtIP) is a well-known DNA repair factor that promotes the processing of DNA double-strand break (DSB) to initiate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair. However, it was unclear whether CtIP has other unknown cellular functions. Here, we aimed to uncover the roles of CtIP in miRNA maturation and cancer cell metastasis. We found that CtIP is a potential regulatory factor that suppresses the processing of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). CtIP directly bound to both DGCR8 and pri-miRNAs through a conserved Sae2-like domain, reduced the binding of Drosha to DGCR8 and pri-miRNA substrate, and inhibited processing activity of Drosha complex. CtIP depletion significantly increased the expression levels of a subset of mature miRNAs, including miR-302 family members that are associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancer types. We also found that CtIP-inhibited miRNAs, such as miR-302 family members, are not crucial for DSB repair. However, increase of miR-302b levels or loss of CtIP function severely suppressed human colon cancer cell line tumor cell metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of CtIP in miRNA processing and tumor metastasis that represents a new function of CtIP in cancer.	CtIP suppresses primary microRNA maturation and promotes metastasis of colon cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33915127	The retinal insulin receptor (IR) exhibits basal kinase activity equivalent to that of the liver of fed animals, but unlike the liver, does not fluctuate with feeding and fasting; it also declines rapidly after the onset of insulin-deficient diabetes. The ligand(s) that determine basal IR activity in the retina has not been identified. Using a highly sensitive insulin assay, we found that retinal insulin concentrations remain constant in fed versus fasted rats and in diabetic versus control rats; vitreous fluid insulin levels were undetectable. Neutralizing antibodies against insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), but not insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or insulin, decreased IR kinase activity in normal rat retinas, and depletion of IGF-2 from serum specifically reduced IR phosphorylation in retinal cells. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IGF-2 induced greater phosphorylation of the retinal IR than the IGF-1 receptor. Retinal IGF-2 mRNA content was 10-fold higher in adults than pups and orders of magnitude higher than in liver. Diabetes reduced retinal IGF-2, but not IGF-1 or IR, mRNA levels, and reduced IGF-2 and IGF-1 content in vitreous fluid. Finally, intravitreal administration of IGF-2 (mature and pro-forms) increased retinal IR and Akt kinase activity in diabetic rats. Collectively, these data reveal that IGF-2 is the primary ligand that defines basal retinal IR activity and suggest that reduced ocular IGF-2 may contribute to reduced IR activity in response to diabetes. These findings may have importance for understanding the regulation of metabolic and prosurvival signaling in the retina.	Insulin-like growth factor-2 regulates basal retinal insulin receptor activity.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33930463	Overconsumption of sucrose and other sugars has been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Reports suggest hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) as an important contributor to and regulator of carbohydrate-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in hepatic DNL due to overconsumption of carbohydrate diet are less than clear; however, literatures suggest high carbohydrate diet to activate the lipogenic transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), which further transcribes genes involved in DNL. Here, we provide an evidence of an unknown link between nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) activation and increased DNL. Our data indicates high carbohydrate diet to enforce nuclear shuttling of hepatic NF-kappaB p65 and repress transcript levels of sorcin, a cytosolic interacting partner of ChREBP. Reduced sorcin levels, further prompted ChREBP nuclear translocation, leading to enhanced DNL and intrahepatic lipid accumulation both in vivo and in vitro. We further report that pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB abrogated high carbohydrate diet-mediated sorcin repression and thereby prevented ChREBP nuclear translocation and this, in turn, attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation both in in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, sorcin knockdown blunted the lipid-lowering ability of the NF-kappaB inhibitor in vitro. Together, these data suggest a heretofore unknown role for NF-kappaB in regulating ChREBP nuclear localization and activation, in response to high carbohydrate diet, for further explorations in lines of NAFLD therapeutics.	NF-kappaB p65 regulates hepatic lipogenesis by promoting nuclear entry of ChREBP in response to a high carbohydrate diet.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33930462	"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological forms of tau are transferred from cell to cell and ""seed"" aggregation of cytoplasmic tau. Phosphorylation of tau plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major component of lipoproteins in the brain, is a genetic risk determinant for AD. The identification of the apoE receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), as an endocytic receptor for tau raises several questions about the role of LRP1 in tauopathies: is internalized tau, like other LRP1 ligands, delivered to lysosomes for degradation, and does LRP1 internalize pathological tau leading to cytosolic seeding? We found that LRP1 rapidly internalizes (125)I-labeled tau, which is then efficiently degraded in lysosomal compartments. Surface plasmon resonance experiments confirm high affinity binding of tau and the tau microtubule-binding domain to LRP1. Interestingly, phosphorylated forms of recombinant tau bind weakly to LRP1 and are less efficiently internalized by LRP1. LRP1-mediated uptake of tau is inhibited by apoE, with the apoE4 isoform being the most potent inhibitor, likely because of its higher affinity for LRP1. Employing post-translationally-modified tau derived from brain lysates of human AD brain tissue, we found that LRP1-expressing cells, but not LRP1-deficient cells, promote cytosolic tau seeding in a process enhanced by apoE. These studies identify LRP1 as an endocytic receptor that binds and processes monomeric forms of tau leading to its degradation and promotes seeding by pathological forms of tau. The balance of these processes may be fundamental to the spread of neuropathology across the brain in AD."	Regulation of tau internalization, degradation, and seeding by LRP1 reveals multiple pathways for tau catabolism.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33930461	RAS effectors specifically interact with GTP-bound RAS proteins to link extracellular signals to downstream signaling pathways. These interactions rely on two types of domains, called RAS-binding (RB) and RAS association (RA) domains, which share common structural characteristics. Although the molecular nature of RAS-effector interactions is well-studied for some proteins, most of the RA/RB-domain-containing proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we searched through human proteome databases, extracting 41 RA domains in 39 proteins and 16 RB domains in 14 proteins, each of which can specifically select at least one of the 25 members in the RAS family. We next comprehensively investigated the sequence-structure-function relationship between different representatives of the RAS family, including HRAS, RRAS, RALA, RAP1B, RAP2A, RHEB1, and RIT1, with all members of RA domain family proteins (RASSFs) and the RB-domain-containing CRAF. The binding affinity for RAS-effector interactions, determined using fluorescence polarization, broadly ranged between high (0.3 muM) and very low (500 muM) affinities, raising interesting questions about the consequence of these variable binding affinities in the regulation of signaling events. Sequence and structural alignments pointed to two interaction hotspots in the RA/RB domains, consisting of an average of 19 RAS-binding residues. Moreover, we found novel interactions between RRAS1, RIT1, and RALA and RASSF7, RASSF9, and RASSF1, respectively, which were systematically explored in sequence-structure-property relationship analysis, and validated by mutational analysis. These data provide a set of distinct functional properties and putative biological roles that should now be investigated in the cellular context.	A comprehensive analysis of RAS-effector interactions reveals interaction hotspots and new binding partners.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33932405	Platelets are key mediators of physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis, whose function must be carefully balanced by signaling downstream of receptors such as protease-activated receptor (PAR)4. Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to regulate various aspects of platelet function. For instance, PKCdelta is known to regulate dense granule secretion, which is important for platelet activation. However, the mechanism by which PKCdelta regulates this process as well as other facets of platelet activity is unknown. We speculated that the way PKCdelta regulates platelet function may be because of the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on PKCdelta. We investigated phosphorylation of PKCdelta following glycoprotein VI-mediated and PAR4-mediated platelet activation and found that Y311 is selectively phosphorylated when PAR4 is activated in human platelets. Therefore, we generated PKCdelta Y311F knock-in mice, which are viable and have no gross abnormalities. However, PKCdeltaY311F mice have significantly enhanced tail-bleeding times compared with WT littermate controls, which means hemostasis is interrupted. Furthermore, PKCdeltaY311F mice exhibit longer time to carotid artery occlusion compared with WT control using a ferric chloride in vivo thrombosis model, indicating that the phosphorylation of PKCdelta Y311 is prothrombotic. Washed platelets from PKCdeltaY311F mice have reduced reactivity after stimulation with a PAR-4 agonist indicating its importance in platelet signaling. The phenotype observed in Y311F mouse platelets is because of reduced thromboxane generation, as an inhibitor of thromboxane generation equalizes the PKCdeltaY311F platelet response to that of WT. Therefore, phosphorylation of PKCdelta on Y311 is important for regulation of platelet function and specifically thromboxane generation, which reinforces platelet activation.	Phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta Tyr311 positively regulates thromboxane generation in platelets.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33932404	Aberrant or constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) contributes to various human inflammatory diseases and malignancies via the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling has potential for therapeutic applications in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We reported previously that Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase, is involved in the preferential repair of oxidized DNA bases from the transcriptionally active sequences via the transcription-coupled base excision repair pathway. We have further shown that Neil2-null mice are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)- and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Both TNFalpha and lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of NF-kappaB. However, the underlying mechanism of NEIL2's role in the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation remains elusive. Here, we have documented a noncanonical function of NEIL2 and demonstrated that the expression of genes, such as Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Il6, and Tnfalpha, involved in inflammation and immune cell migration was significantly higher in both mock- and TNFalpha-treated Neil2-null mice compared with that in the WT mice. NEIL2 blocks NF-kappaB's binding to target gene promoters by directly interacting with the Rel homology region of RelA and represses proinflammatory gene expression as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Remarkably, intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 via a noninvasive nasal route significantly abrogated binding of NF-kappaB to cognate DNA, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory genes and neutrophil recruitment in Neil2-null as well as WT mouse lungs. Our findings thus highlight the potential of NEIL2 as a biologic for inflammation-associated human diseases.	Intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 abrogates NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation.

33933455	The nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) transcription factor performs a critical role in regulating cellular homeostasis as part of the cellular stress response and drives the expression of antioxidants and detoxification enzymes among many other functions. Ubiquitination plays an important role in controlling the abundance and thus nuclear accumulation of Nrf1 proteins, but the regulatory enzymes that act on Nrf1 are not fully defined. Here, we identified ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinating enzyme, as a novel regulator of Nrf1 activity. We found that USP7 interacts with Nrf1a and TCF11-the two long protein isoforms of Nrf1. Expression of wildtype USP7, but not its catalytically defective mutant, resulted in decreased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a, leading to their increased stability and increased transactivation of reporter gene expression by TCF11 and Nrf1a. In contrast, knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of USP7 dramatically increased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a and reduction of their steady state levels. Loss of USP7 function attenuated the induction of Nrf1 protein expression in response to treatment with arsenic and other toxic metals, and inhibition of USP7 activity significantly sensitized cells to arsenic treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that USP7 may act to modulate abundance of Nrf1 protein to induce gene expression in response to toxic metal exposure.	The deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 regulates the transcription factor Nrf1 by modulating its stability in response to toxic metal exposure.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33933452	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the deleterious lesions that are both endogenous and exogenous in origin and are repaired by nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for maintaining genome stability remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the role of two E3 ligases, Dma1 and Dma2 (homologs of human RNF8), in the maintenance of genome stability in budding yeast. Using yeast spotting assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and plasmid and chromosomal repair assays, we establish that Dma1 and Dma2 act in a redundant and a catalysis-dependent manner in the maintenance of genome stability, as well as localize to transcribed regions of the genome and increase in abundance upon phleomycin treatment. In addition, Dma1 and Dma2 are required for the normal kinetics of histone H4 acetylation under DNA damage conditions, genetically interact with RAD9 and SAE2, and are in a complex with Rad53 and histones. Taken together, our results demonstrate the requirement of Dma1 and Dma2 in regulating DNA repair pathway choice, preferentially affecting homologous recombination over nonhomologous end joining, and open up the possibility of using these candidates in manipulating the repair pathways toward precision genome editing.

33933451	Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) folds and trafficks inefficiently, with only 20% of newly expressed protein trafficking to the cell surface. This behavior is exacerbated in many of the mutants associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, motivating further study. Here we characterized the role of N-glycosylation in limiting PMP22 trafficking. We first eliminated N-glycosylation using an N41Q mutation, which resulted in an almost 3-fold increase in trafficking efficiency of wildtype (WT) PMP22 and a 10-fold increase for the severely unstable L16P disease mutant in HEK293 cells, with similar results in Schwann cells. Total cellular levels were also much higher for the WT/N41Q mutant, although not for the L16P/N41Q form. Depletion of oligosaccharyltransferase OST-A and OST-B subunits revealed that WT PMP22 is N-glycosylated posttranslationally by OST-B, whereas L16P is cotranslationally glycosylated by OST-A. Quantitative proteomic screens revealed similarities and differences in the interactome for WT, glycosylation-deficient, and unstable mutant forms of PMP22 and also suggested that L16P is sequestered at earlier stages of endoplasmic reticulum quality control. CRISPR knockout studies revealed a role for retention in endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1 (RER1) in limiting the trafficking of all three forms, for UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1) in limiting the trafficking of WT and L16P but not N41Q, and calnexin (CNX) in limiting the trafficking of WT and N41Q but not L16P. This work shows that N-glycosylation is a limiting factor to forward trafficking PMP22 and sheds light on the proteins involved in its quality control.	Glycosylation limits forward trafficking of the tetraspan membrane protein PMP22.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33933448	Proper dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation are essential for neuronal development and function. Dasm1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is known to promote dendrite outgrowth and excitatory synapse maturation in vitro. However, the in vivo function of Dasm1 in neuronal development and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To learn more, Dasm1 knockout mice were constructed and employed to confirm that Dasm1 regulates dendrite arborization and spine formation in vivo. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Dasm1, revealing MRCKbeta as a putative partner; additional lines of evidence confirmed this interaction and identified cytoplasmic proline-rich region (823-947 aa) of Dasm1 and MRCKbeta self-activated kinase domain (CC1, 410-744 aa) as necessary and sufficient for binding. Using co-immunoprecipitation assay, autophosphorylation assay, and BS3 cross-linking assay, we show that Dasm1 binding triggers a change in MRCKbeta's conformation and subsequent dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation and activation. Activated MRCKbeta in turn phosphorylates a class 2 regulatory myosin light chain, which leads to enhanced actin rearrangement, causing the dendrite outgrowth and spine formation observed before. Removal of Dasm1 in mice leads to behavioral abnormalities. Together, these results reveal a crucial molecular pathway mediating cell surface and intracellular signaling communication to regulate actin dynamics and neuronal development in the mammalian brain.	MRCKbeta links Dasm1 to actin rearrangements to promote dendrite development.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33957127	Anoctamin-1 (ANO1) (TMEM16A) is a calcium-activated chloride channel that plays critical roles in diverse physiological processes, such as sensory transduction and epithelial secretion. ANO1 levels have been shown to be altered under physiological and pathological conditions, although the molecular mechanisms that control ANO1 protein levels remain unclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is known to regulate the levels of numerous ion channels, but little information is available regarding whether and how ubiquitination regulates levels of ANO1. Here, we showed that two E3 ligases, TRIM23 and TRIM21, physically interact with the C terminus of ANO1. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that whereas TRIM23 ubiquitinated ANO1 leading to its stabilization, TRIM21 ubiquitinated ANO1 and induced its degradation. Notably, ANO1 regulation by TRIM23 and TRIM21 is involved in chemical-induced pain sensation, salivary secretion, and heart-rate control in mice, and TRIM23 also mediates ANO1 upregulation induced by epidermal growth factor treatment. Our results suggest that these two antagonistic E3 ligases act together to control ANO1 expression and function. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating ANO1 protein levels and identify a potential molecular link between ANO1 regulation, epidermal growth factor, and other signaling pathways.

33965375	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells and that the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction. In vitro binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models depleted cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Our data suggest that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses that utilize GRP78 in combination therapy.	The chaperone GRP78 is a host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 and GRP78 depleting antibody blocks viral entry and infection.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33965374	One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aberrant activation of kinases in AD has been suggested to enhance phosphorylation and toxicity of tau, making the responsible tau kinases attractive therapeutic targets. The full complement of tau-interacting kinases in AD brain and their activity in disease remains incompletely defined. Here, immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) identified TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a tau-interacting partner in human AD cortical brain tissues. We validated this interaction in human AD, familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) caused by mutations in MAPT (R406W & P301L) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) postmortem brain tissues as well as human cell lines. Further, we document increased TBK1 activation in both AD and FTDP-17 and map TBK1 phosphorylation sites on tau based on in vitro kinase assays coupled to MS. Lastly, in a Drosophila tauopathy model, activating expression of a conserved TBK1 ortholog triggers tau hyperphosphorylation and enhanced neurodegeneration, whereas knockdown had the reciprocal effect, suppressing tau toxicity. Collectively, our findings suggest that increased TBK1 activation may promote tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD and related tauopathies.	TBK1 interacts with tau and enhances neurodegeneration in tauopathy.	The Journal of biological chemistry
33991522	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) is a potent mitogen that activates the IGF receptor (IGFR)/insulin receptor substrate (IRS) axis, thus stimulating growth in normal cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer. Posttranslational modifications of IRS such as ubiquitination tightly control IGF signaling, and we previously identified IRS-1 as a potential substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF4 using an unbiased screen. Here we provide evidence that TRAF4-mediated ubiquitination of IRS-1 is physiologically relevant and crucial for IGF signal transduction. Through site-directed mutagenesis we found that TRAF4 promotes an atypical K29-linked ubiquitination at the C-terminal end of IRS-1. Its depletion abolishes AKT and ERK phosphorylation downstream of IGF-1 and inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression of TRAF4 enhances IGF1-induced IGFR-IRS-1 interaction, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and downstream effector protein activation, whereas mutation of IRS-1 ubiquitination sites completely abolishes these effects. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that nonproteolytic ubiquitination of IRS-1 is a key step in conveying IGF-1 stimulation from IGFR to IRS-1.	The E3 ligase TRAF4 promotes IGF signaling by mediating atypical ubiquitination of IRS-1.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34015330	The glycoprotein alpha-dystroglycan helps to link the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. A unique glycan structure attached to this protein is required for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. Up to now, this is the only mammalian glycan known to contain ribitol phosphate groups. Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus use CDP-ribitol to incorporate ribitol phosphate into the glycan chain of alpha-dystroglycan. Since CDP-ribitol is synthesized in the cytoplasm, we hypothesized that an unknown transporter must be required for its import into the Golgi apparatus. We discovered that CDP-ribitol transport relies on the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and the transporter SLC35A4 in a redundant manner. These two transporters are closely related, but bulky residues in the predicted binding pocket of SLC35A4 limit its size. We hypothesized that the large binding pocket SLC35A1 might accommodate the bulky CMP-sialic acid and the smaller CDP-ribitol, whereas SLC35A4 might only accept CDP-ribitol. To test this, we expressed SLC35A1 with mutations in its binding pocket in SLC35A1 KO cell lines. When we restricted the binding site of SLC35A1 by introducing the bulky residues present in SLC35A4, the mutant transporter was unable to support sialylation of proteins in cells but still supported ribitol phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the size of the binding pocket determines the substrate specificity of SLC35A1, allowing a variety of cytosine nucleotide conjugates to be transported. The redundancy with SLC35A4 also explains why patients with SLC35A1 mutations do not show symptoms of alpha-dystroglycan deficiency.	The promiscuous binding pocket of SLC35A1 ensures redundant transport of CDP-ribitol to the Golgi.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34022224	The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (WWTR1) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhances drug resistance in multiple cancers. TAZ has been shown to interact with transcription factors in the nucleus, but when phosphorylated, translocates to the cytoplasm and is degraded through proteasomes. Here, we identified a compound TAZ inhibitor 4 (TI-4) that shifted TAZ localization to the cytoplasm independently of its phosphorylation. We used affinity beads to ascertain a putative target of TI-4, chromosomal segregation 1 like (CSE1L), which is known to be involved in the recycling of importin alpha and as a biomarker of cancer malignancy. We found that TI-4 suppressed TAZ-mediated transcription in a CSE1L-dependent manner. CSE1L overexpression increased nuclear levels of TAZ, whereas CSE1L silencing delayed its nuclear import. We also found via the in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments that TI-4 strengthened the interaction between CSE1L and importin alpha5 and blocked the binding of importin alpha5 to TAZ. WWTR1 silencing attenuated CSE1L-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness of human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. Conversely, CSE1L silencing blocked TAZ-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness in human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. In human cancer tissues, the expression level of CSE1L was found to correlate with nuclear levels of TAZ. These findings support that CSE1L promotes the nuclear accumulation of TAZ and enhances malignancy in cancer cells.	CSE1L promotes nuclear accumulation of transcriptional coactivator TAZ and enhances invasiveness of human cancer cells.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34022220	After activation of G protein-coupled receptors, G protein betagamma dimers may translocate from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus (GA). We recently report that this translocation activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) via PI3Kgamma; however, how Gbetagamma-PI3Kgamma activates the ERK1/2 pathway is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CXCR4 activates ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase important for vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking. This activation is blocked by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the GA-translocating Ggamma9 subunit. Inducible targeting of different Gbetagamma dimers to the GA can directly activate ARF1. CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gbetagamma recruitment to the GA also enhance ARF1 translocation to the GA. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of PI3Kgamma markedly inhibit CXCR4-mediated and Gbetagamma translocation-mediated ARF1 activation. We also show that depletion of ARF1 by siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 and inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 activation abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gbetagamma translocation to the GA and suppress prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and invasion. Collectively, our data reveal a novel function for Gbetagamma translocation to the GA to activate ARF1 and identify GA-localized ARF1 as an effector acting downstream of Gbetagamma-PI3Kgamma to spatiotemporally regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases.	Gbetagamma translocation to the Golgi apparatus activates ARF1 to spatiotemporally regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling to MAPK.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34023381	A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that mediates both inflammation and ubiquitination in mammals, but the related mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) screening, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell model to identify novel A20-interacting proteins. We confirmed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, also known as ring finger protein 41 (RNF41), interacted with A20 in LPS-stimulated cells. Further co-IP analysis demonstrated that when A20 was knocked out, degradation-inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of inflammatory effector MyD88 was decreased, but protein interaction-mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of another inflammatory effector TBK1 was increased. Moreover, western blot experiments showed that A20 inhibition induced an increase in levels of MyD88 and phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins as well as of TBK1 and a downstream effector, while Nrdp1 inhibition induced an increase in MyD88 but a decrease in TBK1 levels. When A20 and Nrdp1 were coinhibited, no further change in MyD88 was observed, but TBK1 levels were significantly decreased compared with those upon A20 inhibition alone. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses revealed that the ZnF4 domain of A20 is required for Nrdp1 polyubiquitination. Upon LPS stimulation, the inhibition of Nrdp1 alone increased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha but decreased IFN-beta secretion, as observed in other studies, suggesting that Nrdp1 preferentially promotes the production of IFN-beta. Taken together, these results demonstrated that A20/Nrdp1 interaction is important for A20 anti-inflammation, thus revealing a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of A20.	A20/Nrdp1 interaction alters the inflammatory signaling profile by mediating K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of effectors MyD88 and TBK1.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34029594	Normal contractile function of the heart depends on a constant and reliable production of ATP by cardiomyocytes. Dysregulation of cardiac energy metabolism can result in immature heart development and disrupt the ability of the adult myocardium to adapt to stress, potentially leading to heart failure. Further, restoration of abnormal mitochondrial function can have beneficial effects on cardiac dysfunction. Previously, we identified a novel protein termed Perm1 (PGC-1 and estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-induced regulator, muscle 1) that is enriched in skeletal and cardiac-muscle mitochondria and transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1) and ERR. The role of Perm1 in the heart is poorly understood and is studied here. We utilized cell culture, mouse models, and human tissue, to study its expression and transcriptional control, as well as its role in transcription of other factors. Critically, we tested Perm1's role in cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function and its ability to protect myocytes from stress-induced damage. Our studies show that Perm1 expression increases throughout mouse cardiogenesis, demonstrate that Perm1 interacts with PGC-1alpha and enhances activation of PGC-1 and ERR, increases mitochondrial DNA copy number, and augments oxidative capacity in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we found that Perm1 reduced cellular damage produced as a result of hypoxia and reoxygenation-induced stress and mitigated cell death of cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our results show that Perm1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse cardiomyocytes. Future studies can assess the potential of Perm1 to be used as a novel therapeutic to restore cardiac dysfunction induced by ischemic injury.

34029587	Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.	Arginine methylation of SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid protein regulates RNA binding, its ability to suppress stress granule formation, and viral replication.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34216621	The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the prevention of many age-related diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol, a plant polyphenol, exhibits antiaging, antitumor, and vascular protection effects by activating Sirt1. However, the molecular mechanism of Sirt1 activation as induced by resveratrol remains unclear. By knockdown/rescue experiments, fluorometric Sirt1 activity assay, immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, we identify here that the tumor suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) as a direct activator of Sirt1 elicited by resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes the binding between LKB1 and Sirt1, which we first reported, and this binding leads to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Sirt1 at three different serine residues in the C terminus of Sirt1. Mechanistically, LKB1-mediated phosphorylation increases intramolecular interactions in Sirt1, such as the binding of the C terminus to the deacetylase core domain, thereby eliminating DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1, Sirt1 endogenous inhibitor) inhibition and promoting Sirt1-substrate interaction. Functionally, LKB1-dependent Sirt1 activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through deacetylation and activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. These results identify Sirt1 as a context-dependent target of LKB1 and suggest that a resveratrol-stimulated LKB1-Sirt1 pathway plays a vital role in mitochondrial metabolism, a key physiological process that contributes to numerous age-related diseases.	Resveratrol-induced Sirt1 phosphorylation by LKB1 mediates mitochondrial metabolism.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34216619	Interferon-gamma-inducible factor 16 (IFI16) triggers stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING)-dependent type I IFN production during host antiviral immunity and facilitates p53-dependent apoptosis during suppressing tumorigenesis. We have previously reported that STING-mediated IFI16 degradation negatively regulates type I IFN production. However, it is unknown whether STING also suppresses IFI16/p53-dependent apoptosis via degradation of IFI16. Here, our results from flow cytometry apoptosis detection and immunoblot assays show that IFI16 and nutlin-3, a p53 pathway activator, synergistically induce apoptosis in U2OS and A549 cells. Protein kinase R-triggered phosphorylation of p53 at serine 392 is critical for the IFI16-p53-dependent apoptosis. However, overexpression of STING suppresses p53 serine 392 phosphorylation, p53 transcriptional activity, expression of p53 target genes, and p53-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis. In summary, our current study demonstrates that STING-mediated IFI16 degradation negatively regulates IFI16-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis in osteosarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells, which suggests a protumorigenic role for STING in certain cancer types because of its potent ability to degrade upstream IFI16.

34216618	The neurotrophin receptors p75 and tyrosine protein kinase receptor A (TrkA) play important roles in the development and survival of the nervous system. Biochemical data suggest that p75 and TrkA reciprocally regulate the activities of each other. For instance, p75 is able to regulate the response of TrkA to lower concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), and TrkA promotes shedding of the extracellular domain of p75 by alpha-secretases in a ligand-dependent manner. The current model suggests that p75 and TrkA are regulated by means of a direct physical interaction; however, the nature of such interaction has been elusive thus far. Here, using NMR in micelles, multiscale molecular dynamics, FRET, and functional studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction between TrkA and p75 through their respective transmembrane domains (TMDs). Molecular dynamics of p75-TMD mutants suggests that although the interaction between TrkA and p75 TMDs is maintained upon mutation, a specific protein interface is required to facilitate TrkA active homodimerization in the presence of NGF. The same mutations in the TMD protein interface of p75 reduced the activation of TrkA by NGF as well as reducing cell differentiation. In summary, we provide a structural model of the p75-TrkA receptor complex necessary for neuronal development stabilized by TMD interactions.	Interaction between the transmembrane domains of neurotrophin receptors p75 and TrkA mediates their reciprocal activation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34181950	Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (Sgk3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) downstream of growth factor signaling via class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and by class III PI3K/Vps34-mediated PI3P production on endosomes. Upregulation of Sgk3 activity has recently been linked to a number of human cancers; however, the precise mechanism of activation of Sgk3 is unknown. Here, we use a wide range of cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical techniques, including hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, to investigate the mechanism of activation of Sgk3 by PI3P. We show that Sgk3 is regulated by a combination of phosphorylation and allosteric activation. We demonstrate that binding of Sgk3 to PI3P via its regulatory phox homology (PX) domain induces large conformational changes in Sgk3 associated with its activation and that the PI3P-binding pocket of the PX domain of Sgk3 is sequestered in its inactive conformation. Finally, we reconstitute Sgk3 activation via Vps34-mediated PI3P synthesis on phosphatidylinositol liposomes in vitro. In addition to identifying the mechanism of Sgk3 activation by PI3P, our findings open up potential therapeutic avenues in allosteric inhibitor development to target Sgk3 in cancer.

34181949	Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and DNA Ligase IIIalpha (LigIIIalpha) are key enzymes in single-strand break (SSB) repair. TDP1 removes 3'-tyrosine residues remaining after degradation of DNA topoisomerase (TOP) 1 cleavage complexes trapped by either DNA lesions or TOP1 inhibitors. It is not known how TDP1 is linked to subsequent processing and LigIIIalpha-catalyzed joining of the SSB. Here we define a direct interaction between the TDP1 catalytic domain and the LigIII DNA-binding domain (DBD) regulated by conformational changes in the unstructured TDP1 N-terminal region induced by phosphorylation and/or alterations in amino acid sequence. Full-length and N-terminally truncated TDP1 are more effective at correcting SSB repair defects in TDP1 null cells compared with full-length TDP1 with amino acid substitutions of an N-terminal serine residue phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. TDP1 forms a stable complex with LigIII170-755, as well as full-length LigIIIalpha alone or in complex with the DNA repair scaffold protein XRCC1. Small-angle X-ray scattering and negative stain electron microscopy combined with mapping of the interacting regions identified a TDP1/LigIIIalpha compact dimer of heterodimers in which the two LigIII catalytic cores are positioned in the center, whereas the two TDP1 molecules are located at the edges of the core complex flanked by highly flexible regions that can interact with other repair proteins and SSBs. As TDP1and LigIIIalpha together repair adducts caused by TOP1 cancer chemotherapy inhibitors, the defined interaction architecture and regulation of this enzyme complex provide insights into a key repair pathway in nonmalignant and cancer cells.

34171357	The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is an important regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. CREB is activated through phosphorylation of an evolutionarily conserved Ser residue (S133) within its intrinsically disordered kinase-inducible domain (KID). Phosphorylation of S133 in response to cAMP, Ca(2+), and other stimuli triggers an association of the KID with the KID-interacting (KIX) domain of the CREB-binding protein (CBP), a histone acetyl transferase (HAT) that promotes transcriptional activation. Here we addressed the mechanisms of CREB attenuation following bursts in CREB phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation of S133 is reversed by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is recruited to CREB through its B56 regulatory subunits. We found that a B56-binding site located at the carboxyl-terminal boundary of the KID (BS2) mediates high-affinity B56 binding, while a second binding site (BS1) located near the amino terminus of the KID mediates low affinity binding enhanced by phosphorylation of adjacent casein kinase (CK) phosphosites. Mutations that diminished B56 binding to BS2 elevated both basal and stimulus-induced phosphorylation of S133, increased CBP interaction with CREB, and potentiated the expression of CREB-dependent reporter genes. Cells from mice harboring a homozygous Creb(E153D) mutation that disrupts BS2 exhibited increased S133 phosphorylation stoichiometry and elevated transcriptional bursts to cAMP. These findings provide insights into substrate targeting by PP2A holoenzymes and establish a new mechanism of CREB attenuation that has implications for understanding CREB signaling in cell growth, metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and other physiologic contexts.

34157286	Post-translational modifications to tubulin are important for many microtubule-based functions inside cells. It was recently shown that methylation of tubulin by the histone methyltransferase SETD2 occurs on mitotic spindle microtubules during cell division, with its absence resulting in mitotic defects. However, the catalytic mechanism of methyl addition to tubulin is unclear. We used a truncated version of human wild type SETD2 (tSETD2) containing the catalytic SET and C-terminal Set2-Rpb1-interacting (SRI) domains to investigate the biochemical mechanism of tubulin methylation. We found that recombinant tSETD2 had a higher activity toward tubulin dimers than polymerized microtubules. Using recombinant single-isotype tubulin, we demonstrated that methylation was restricted to lysine 40 of alpha-tubulin. We then introduced pathogenic mutations into tSETD2 to probe the recognition of histone and tubulin substrates. A mutation in the catalytic domain (R1625C) allowed tSETD2 to bind to tubulin but not methylate it, whereas a mutation in the SRI domain (R2510H) caused loss of both tubulin binding and methylation. Further investigation of the role of the SRI domain in substrate binding found that mutations within this region had differential effects on the ability of tSETD2 to bind to tubulin versus the binding partner RNA polymerase II for methylating histones in vivo, suggesting distinct mechanisms for tubulin and histone methylation by SETD2. Finally, we found that substrate recognition also requires the negatively charged C-terminal tail of alpha-tubulin. Together, this study provides a framework for understanding how SETD2 serves as a dual methyltransferase for both histone and tubulin methylation.

34153319	Fibrosis is a pronounced feature of heart disease and the result of dysregulated activation of resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Recent work identified stress-induced degradation of the cytoskeletal protein betaIV-spectrin as an important step in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, loss of betaIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism for CaMKII-dependent regulation of betaIV-spectrin and CF activity. Computational screening and MS revealed a critical serine residue (S2250 in mouse and S2254 in human) in betaIV-spectrin phosphorylated by CaMKII. Disruption of betaIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction or alanine substitution of betaIV-spectrin Ser2250 (betaIV-S2254A) prevented CaMKII-induced degradation, whereas a phosphomimetic construct (betaIV-spectrin with glutamic acid substitution at serine 2254 [betaIV-S2254E]) showed accelerated degradation in the absence of CaMKII. To assess the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event, we expressed exogenous betaIV-S2254A and betaIV-S2254E constructs in betaIV-spectrin-deficient CFs, which have increased proliferation and fibrotic gene expression compared with WT CFs. betaIV-S2254A but not betaIV-S2254E normalized CF proliferation, gene expression, and contractility. Pathophysiological targeting of betaIV-spectrin phosphorylation and subsequent degradation was identified in CFs activated with the profibrotic ligand angiotensin II, resulting in increased proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 nuclear accumulation. While therapeutic delivery of exogenous WT betaIV-spectrin partially reversed these trends, betaIV-S2254A completely negated increased CF proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 translocation. Moreover, we observed betaIV-spectrin phosphorylation and associated loss in total protein within human heart tissue following heart failure. Together, these data illustrate a considerable role for the betaIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction in activating profibrotic signaling.

34146543	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor activated by exogenous halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, including the environmental toxin TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and naturally occurring dietary and endogenous compounds. The activated AHR enhances transcription of specific genes including phase I and phase II metabolism enzymes and other targets genes such as the TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP). The regulation of AHR activation is a dynamic process: immediately after transcriptional activation of the AHR by TCDD, the AHR is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is subjected to proteasomal degradation. However, the mechanisms regulating AHR degradation are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of two enzymes reported to enhance AHR breakdown: the cullin 4B (CUL4B)(AHR) complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the AHR and other proteins for ubiquitination, and TiPARP, which targets proteins for ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that can increase susceptibility to degradation. Using a WT mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line and an MEF cell line in which CUL4B has been deleted (MEF(Cul4b-null)), we discovered that loss of CUL4B partially prevented AHR degradation after TCDD exposure, while knocking down TiPARP in MEF(Cul4b-null) cells completely abolished AHR degradation upon TCDD treatment. Increased TCDD-activated AHR protein levels in MEF(Cul4b-null) and MEF(Cul4b-null) cells in which TiPARP was knocked down led to enhanced AHR transcriptional activity, indicating that CUL4B and TiPARP restrain AHR action. This study reveals a novel function of TiPARP in controlling TCDD-activated AHR nuclear export and subsequent proteasomal degradation.

34144039	Abl family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases activated by diverse cellular stimuli that regulate cytoskeleton organization, morphogenesis, and adhesion. The catalytic activity of Abl family kinases is tightly regulated in cells by a complex set of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and post-translational modifications. For example, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), important for cell proliferation and chemotaxis, is a potent activator of Abl family kinases. However, the molecular mechanism by which PDGFRbeta engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. We show here that the Abl2 Src homology 2 domain directly binds to phosphotyrosine Y771 in the PDGFRbeta cytoplasmic domain. PDGFRbeta directly phosphorylates multiple novel sites on the N-terminal half of Abl2, including Y116, Y139, and Y161 within the Src homology 3 domain, and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310 are all located at or near the Src homology 3/Src homology 2-kinase linker interface, which helps maintain Abl family kinases in an autoinhibited conformation. We also found that PDGFRbeta-mediated phosphorylation of Abl2 in vitro activates Abl2 kinase activity, but mutation of these four tyrosines (Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310) to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRbeta-mediated activation of Abl2. These findings reveal how PDGFRbeta engages and phosphorylates Abl2 leading to activation of the kinase, providing a framework to understand how growth factor receptors engage and activate Abl family kinases.

34118235	Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell division in multicellular organisms.

34089703	Phospholipase A1 (PLA1) hydrolyzes the fatty acids of glycerophospholipids, which are structural components of the cellular membrane. Genetic mutations in DDHD1, an intracellular PLA1, result in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in humans. However, the regulation of DDHD1 activity has not yet been elucidated in detail. In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation of DDHD1 and identified the responsible protein kinases. We performed MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis and Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in alanine-substitution mutants in HEK293 cells and revealed multiple phosphorylation sites in human DDHD1, primarily Ser8, Ser11, Ser723, and Ser727. The treatment of cells with a protein phosphatase inhibitor induced the hyperphosphorylation of DDHD1, suggesting that multisite phosphorylation occurred not only at these major, but also at minor sites. Site-specific kinase-substrate prediction algorithms and in vitro kinase analyses indicated that cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1/cyclin A2 phosphorylated Ser8, Ser11, and Ser727 in DDHD1 with a preference for Ser11 and that CDK5/p35 also phosphorylated Ser11 and Ser727 with a preference for Ser11. In addition, casein kinase CK2alpha1 was found to phosphorylate Ser104, although this was not a major phosphorylation site in cultivated HEK293 cells. The evaluation of the effects of phosphorylation revealed that the phosphorylation mimic mutants S11/727E exhibit only 20% reduction in PLA1 activity. However, the phosphorylation mimics were mainly localized to focal adhesions, whereas the phosphorylation-resistant mutants S11/727A were not. This suggested that phosphorylation alters the subcellular localization of DDHD1 without greatly affecting its PLA1 activity.

34029587	Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.

34023381	A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that mediates both inflammation and ubiquitination in mammals, but the related mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) screening, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell model to identify novel A20-interacting proteins. We confirmed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, also known as ring finger protein 41 (RNF41), interacted with A20 in LPS-stimulated cells. Further co-IP analysis demonstrated that when A20 was knocked out, degradation-inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of inflammatory effector MyD88 was decreased, but protein interaction-mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of another inflammatory effector TBK1 was increased. Moreover, western blot experiments showed that A20 inhibition induced an increase in levels of MyD88 and phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins as well as of TBK1 and a downstream effector, while Nrdp1 inhibition induced an increase in MyD88 but a decrease in TBK1 levels. When A20 and Nrdp1 were coinhibited, no further change in MyD88 was observed, but TBK1 levels were significantly decreased compared with those upon A20 inhibition alone. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses revealed that the ZnF4 domain of A20 is required for Nrdp1 polyubiquitination. Upon LPS stimulation, the inhibition of Nrdp1 alone increased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha but decreased IFN-beta secretion, as observed in other studies, suggesting that Nrdp1 preferentially promotes the production of IFN-beta. Taken together, these results demonstrated that A20/Nrdp1 interaction is important for A20 anti-inflammation, thus revealing a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of A20.

34298014	Insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) encode endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins that regulate intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, some of which orchestrate lipid metabolism via interaction with INSIGs. Recently, it was reported that expression of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) was induced by certain oxysterols; the precise of mechanism is unclear. Herein, we show that INSIGs mediate ATF4 upregulation upon interaction with oxysterol. Oxysterols that possess a high affinity for INSIG, such as 27- and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), markedly induced the increase of ATF4 protein when compared with other oxysterols. In addition, ATF4 upregulation by these oxysterols was attenuated in INSIG1/2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and recovered by either INSIG1 or INSIG2 rescue. Mechanistic studies revealed that the binding of 25HC to INSIG is critical for increased ATF4 protein via activation of protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha. Knockout of INSIG1 or INSIG2 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells attenuated ATF4 protein upregulation, indicating that only one of the endogenous INSIGs, unlike overexpression of intrinsic INSIG1 or INSIG2, was insufficient for ATF4 induction. Furthermore, ATF4 proactively upregulated the cell death-inducible gene expression, such as Chop, Chac1, and Trb3, thereby markedly reducing cell viability with 25HC. These findings support a model whereby that INSIGs sense an increase in oxysterol in the endoplasmic reticulum and induce an increase of ATF4 protein via the protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha pathway, thereby promoting cell death.	Insulin-induced genes INSIG1 and INSIG2 mediate oxysterol-dependent activation of the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34293347	NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces the superoxide anion radical (O2(-)), which has functions in both cell signaling and immune defense. NOX2 is a multimeric-protein complex consisting of several protein subunits including the GTPase Rac. NOX2 uniquely facilitates an oxidative burst, which is described by initially slow O2(-) production, which increases over time. The NOX2 oxidative burst is considered critical to immune defense because it enables expedited O2(-) production in response to infections. However, the mechanism of the initiation and progression of this oxidative burst and its implications for regulation of NOX2 have not been clarified. In this study, we show that the NOX2 oxidative burst is a result of autoactivation of NOX2 coupled with the redox function of Rac. NOX2 autoactivation begins when active Rac triggers NOX2 activation and the subsequent production of O2(-), which in turn activates redox-sensitive Rac. This activated Rac further activates NOX2, amplifying the feedforward cycle and resulting in a NOX2-mediated oxidative burst. Using mutagenesis-based kinetic and cell analyses, we show that enzymatic activation of Rac is exclusively responsible for production of the active Rac trigger that initiates NOX2 autoactivation, whereas redox-mediated Rac activation is the main driving force of NOX2 autoactivation and contributes to generation of approximately 98% of the active NOX2 in cells. The results of this study provide insight into the regulation of NOX2 function, which could be used to develop therapeutics to control immune responses associated with dysregulated NOX2 oxidative bursts.

34216618	The neurotrophin receptors p75 and tyrosine protein kinase receptor A (TrkA) play important roles in the development and survival of the nervous system. Biochemical data suggest that p75 and TrkA reciprocally regulate the activities of each other. For instance, p75 is able to regulate the response of TrkA to lower concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), and TrkA promotes shedding of the extracellular domain of p75 by alpha-secretases in a ligand-dependent manner. The current model suggests that p75 and TrkA are regulated by means of a direct physical interaction; however, the nature of such interaction has been elusive thus far. Here, using NMR in micelles, multiscale molecular dynamics, FRET, and functional studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction between TrkA and p75 through their respective transmembrane domains (TMDs). Molecular dynamics of p75-TMD mutants suggests that although the interaction between TrkA and p75 TMDs is maintained upon mutation, a specific protein interface is required to facilitate TrkA active homodimerization in the presence of NGF. The same mutations in the TMD protein interface of p75 reduced the activation of TrkA by NGF as well as reducing cell differentiation. In summary, we provide a structural model of the p75-TrkA receptor complex necessary for neuronal development stabilized by TMD interactions.	Interaction between the transmembrane domains of neurotrophin receptors p75 and TrkA mediates their reciprocal activation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34216621	The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the prevention of many age-related diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol, a plant polyphenol, exhibits antiaging, antitumor, and vascular protection effects by activating Sirt1. However, the molecular mechanism of Sirt1 activation as induced by resveratrol remains unclear. By knockdown/rescue experiments, fluorometric Sirt1 activity assay, immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, we identify here that the tumor suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) as a direct activator of Sirt1 elicited by resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes the binding between LKB1 and Sirt1, which we first reported, and this binding leads to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Sirt1 at three different serine residues in the C terminus of Sirt1. Mechanistically, LKB1-mediated phosphorylation increases intramolecular interactions in Sirt1, such as the binding of the C terminus to the deacetylase core domain, thereby eliminating DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1, Sirt1 endogenous inhibitor) inhibition and promoting Sirt1-substrate interaction. Functionally, LKB1-dependent Sirt1 activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through deacetylation and activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. These results identify Sirt1 as a context-dependent target of LKB1 and suggest that a resveratrol-stimulated LKB1-Sirt1 pathway plays a vital role in mitochondrial metabolism, a key physiological process that contributes to numerous age-related diseases.	Resveratrol-induced Sirt1 phosphorylation by LKB1 mediates mitochondrial metabolism.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34302808	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to drive key cancer pathways but the functions of majority of lncRNAs are unknown making a case for comprehensive functional evaluation of lncRNAs. With an aim to identify lncRNAs dysregulated in human cancers, we analyzed the cancer patient database of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which revealed an upregulated lncRNA, LINC02381 (renamed HOXC10mRNA stabilizing factor or HMS in this study), whose depletion results in proliferation defects and inhibition of colony formation of human cancer cells. In order to identify the binding targets of HMS, we screened for cis-genes and discovered that HOXC10, an oncogene, is downregulated in the absence of HMS. Depletion of HMS does not affect the HOXC10 promoter activity but inhibits the HOXC10 3'-UTR-linked luciferase reporter activity. Since lncRNAs have been known to associate with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to stabilize mRNA transcripts, we screened for different RBPs and discovered that HuR, an ELAV family protein, stabilizes HOXC10 mRNA. Using RNA pull-down and deletion mapping experiments, we show that HuR physically interacts with the cytosine-rich stretch of HMS and HOXC10 3'-UTR to stabilize HOXC10 mRNA. HOXC10 is overexpressed in many human cancers, and our discovery highlights that lncRNA HMS sustains the HOXC10 mRNA levels to maintain the invasive phenotypes of cancer cells.	The lncRNA HMS recruits RNA-binding protein HuR to stabilize the 3'-UTR of HOXC10 mRNA.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34214498	Apart from prevention using vaccinations, the management options for COVID-19 remain limited. In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-kappaB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.	Famotidine inhibits toll-like receptor 3-mediated inflammatory signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34265306	The Hippo pathway is a key regulatory pathway that is tightly regulated by mechanical cues such as tension, pressure, and contact with the extracellular matrix and other cells. At the distal end of the pathway is the yes-associated protein (YAP), a well-characterized transcriptional regulator. Through binding to transcription factors such as the TEA Domain TFs (TEADs) YAP regulates expression of several genes involved in cell fate, proliferation and death decisions. While the function of YAP as direct transcriptional regulator has been extensively characterized, only a small number of studies examined YAP function as a regulator of gene expression via microRNAs. We utilized bioinformatic approaches, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-Seq, to identify potential new targets of YAP regulation and identified miR-30a as a YAP target gene in Schwann cells. We find that YAP binds to the promoter and regulates the expression of miR-30a. Moreover, we identify several YAP-regulated genes that are putative miR-30a targets and focus on two of these, protein tyrosine pohosphatase non-receptor type 13 (PTPN13) and Kruppel like factor 9. We find that YAP regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and death is mediated, to a significant extent, through miR-30a regulation of PTPN13 in Schwann cells. These findings identify a new regulatory function by YAP, mediated by miR-30a, to downregulate expression of PTPN13 and Kruppel like factor 9. These studies expand our understanding of YAP function as a regulator of miRNAs and illustrate the complexity of YAP transcriptional functions.	Transcriptional regulation of miR-30a by YAP impacts PTPN13 and KLF9 levels and Schwann cell proliferation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34298015	Radial migration during cortical development is required for formation of the six-layered structure of the mammalian cortex. Defective migration of neurons is linked to several developmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. A unique swollen structure called the dilation is formed in migrating neurons and is required for movement of the centrosome and nucleus. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which this dilation forms is unclear. We report that CAMDI, a gene whose deletion is associated with psychiatric behavior, is degraded by cell division cycle protein 20 (Cdc20)-anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) cell-cycle machinery after centrosome migration into the dilation in mouse brain development. We also show that CAMDI is restabilized in the dilation until the centrosome enters the dilation, at which point it is once again immediately destabilized. CAMDI degradation is carried out by binding to Cdc20-APC/C via the destruction box degron of CAMDI. CAMDI destruction box mutant overexpression inhibits dilation formation and neuronal cell migration via maintaining the stabilized state of CAMDI. These results indicate that CAMDI is a substrate of the Cdc20-APC/C system and that the oscillatory regulation of CAMDI protein correlates with dilation formation for proper cortical migration.	Oscillation of Cdc20-APC/C-mediated CAMDI stability is critical for cortical neuron migration.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34224728	Ras-association domain family (RASSF) proteins are encoded by numerous tumor suppressor genes that frequently become silenced in human cancers. RASSF10 is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in cancers and has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism(s) remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that RASSF10 inhibits Cdk1/cyclin-B kinase complex formation to maintain stable levels of cyclin-B for inducing mitotic arrest during cell cycle. Using LC-MS/MS, live cell imaging, and biochemical approaches, we identify Nucleophosmin (NPM) as a novel functional target of RASSF10 and revealed that RASSF10 expression promoted the nuclear accumulation of GADD45a and knockdown of either NPM or GADD45a, resulting in impairment of RASSF10-mediated G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RASSF10 is a substrate for the E3 ligase ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) and show that an NPM-dependent downregulation of RNF2 expression is critical to maintain stable RASSF10 levels in cells for efficient mitotic arrest. Interestingly, the Kaplan-Meier plot analysis shows a positive correlation of RASSF10 and NPM expression with greater gastric cancer patient survival and the reverse with expression of RNF2, suggesting that they may have a role in cancer progression. Finally, our findings provide insights into the mode of action of the RASSF10/NPM/RNF2 signaling cascade on controlling cell proliferation and may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the prevention of gastric cancer metastasis.

34270961	Transcription factors (TFs) harboring broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domains play important roles in development and disease. These BTB domains are thought to recruit transcriptional modulators to target DNA regions. However, a systematic molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of this TF family is lacking. Here, we identify the zinc finger BTB-TF Zbtb2 from a genetic screen for regulators of exit from pluripotency and demonstrate that its absence perturbs embryonic stem cell differentiation and the gene expression dynamics underlying peri-implantation development. We show that ZBTB2 binds the chromatin remodeler Ep400 to mediate downstream transcription. Independently, the BTB domain directly interacts with nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase and histone chaperone histone regulator A. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase recruitment is a common feature of BTB TFs, and based on phylogenetic analysis, we propose that this is a conserved evolutionary property. Binding to UBN2, in contrast, is specific to ZBTB2 and requires a C-terminal extension of the BTB domain. Taken together, this study identifies a BTB-domain TF that recruits chromatin modifiers and a histone chaperone during a developmental cell state transition and defines unique and shared molecular functions of the BTB-domain TF family.	The BTB-domain transcription factor ZBTB2 recruits chromatin remodelers and a histone chaperone during the exit from pluripotency.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34245780	TBK1 responds to microbes to initiate cellular responses critical for host innate immune defense. We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1 and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Although TBK1 has been linked to Akt phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase, has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs, macrophages, and mice bearing an Mtor S2159A knock-in allele (Mtor(A/A)) using in vitro kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promotes mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C). Mechanistically, TBK1 coimmunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus, basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2 (and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal cross talk between TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological settings.	The innate immune kinase TBK1 directly increases mTORC2 activity and downstream signaling to Akt.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34245781	"The cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) are well established as regulators of blood pressure and fluid volume, but they also stimulate adipocyte lipolysis and control the gene program of nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. The NP ""clearance"" receptor C (NPRC) functions to clear NPs from the circulation via peptide internalization and degradation and thus is an important regulator of NP signaling and adipocyte metabolism. It is well known that the Nprc gene is highly expressed in adipose tissue and dynamically regulated upon nutrition and environmental changes. However, the molecular basis for how Nprc gene expression is regulated is still poorly understood. Here, we identified the nuclear receptor transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as a transcriptional regulator of Nprc expression in mouse adipocytes. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, levels of Nprc expression increase in parallel with PPARgamma induction. Rosiglitazone, a classic PPARgamma agonist, increases, whereas siRNA knockdown of PPARgamma reduces, Nprc expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By using chromosome conformation capture and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that PPARgamma controls Nprc gene expression in adipocytes through its long-range distal enhancers. Furthermore, the induction of Nprc expression in adipose tissue during high-fat diet feeding is found to be associated with increased PPARgamma enhancer activity. Our findings define PPARgamma as a mediator of adipocyte Nprc gene expression and establish a new connection between PPARgamma and the control of adipocyte NP signaling in obesity."	Diet-dependent natriuretic peptide receptor C expression in adipose tissue is mediated by PPARgamma via long-range distal enhancers.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34411563	Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils, which are required for proper development of elastic tissues, including the heart and lungs. Through protein-protein interactions with latent transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), microfibrils regulate TGF-beta signaling. Mutations within the 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of FBN1 cause autosomal dominant disorders including Marfan Syndrome, which is characterized by disrupted TGF-beta signaling. We recently identified two novel protein O-glucosyltransferases, Protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 (POGLUT2) and 3 (POGLUT3), that modify a small fraction of EGF repeats on Notch. Here, using mass spectral analysis, we show that POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 also modify over half of the EGF repeats on FBN1, fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and LTBP1. While most sites are modified by both enzymes, some sites show a preference for either POGLUT2 or POGLUT3. POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 are homologs of POGLUT1, which stabilizes Notch proteins by addition of O-glucose to Notch EGF repeats. Like POGLUT1, POGLUT2 and 3 can discern a folded versus unfolded EGF repeat, suggesting POGLUT2 and 3 are involved in a protein folding pathway. In vitro secretion assays using the N-terminal portion of recombinant FBN1 revealed reduced FBN1 secretion in POGLUT2 knockout, POGLUT3 knockout, and POGLUT2 and 3 double-knockout HEK293T cells compared with wild type. These results illustrate that POGLUT2 and 3 function together to O-glucosylate protein substrates and that these modifications play a role in the secretion of substrate proteins. It will be interesting to see how disease variants in these proteins affect their O-glucosylation.

34391780	Phosphorylation (activation) and dephosphorylation (deactivation) of the slit diaphragm proteins NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are critical for maintaining the kidney epithelial podocyte actin cytoskeleton and, therefore, proper glomerular filtration. However, the mechanisms underlying these events remain largely unknown. Here we show that NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are novel receptor proteins for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and can be phosphorylated independently of the mesenchymal epithelial transition receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion through engagement of their extracellular domains by HGF. Furthermore, we demonstrate SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2-dependent dephosphorylation of these proteins. To establish HGF as a ligand, purified baculovirus-expressed NEPHRIN and NEPH1 recombinant proteins were used in surface plasma resonance binding experiments. We report high-affinity interactions of NEPHRIN and NEPH1 with HGF, although NEPHRIN binding was 20-fold higher than that of NEPH1. In addition, using molecular modeling we constructed peptides that were used to map specific HGF-binding regions in the extracellular domains of NEPHRIN and NEPH1. Finally, using an in vitro model of cultured podocytes and an ex vivo model of Drosophila nephrocytes, as well as chemically induced injury models, we demonstrated that HGF-induced phosphorylation of NEPHRIN and NEPH1 is centrally involved in podocyte repair. Taken together, this is the first study demonstrating a receptor-based function for NEPHRIN and NEPH1. This has important biological and clinical implications for the repair of injured podocytes and the maintenance of podocyte integrity.

34298020	Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of kinases and shares a highly conserved kinase domain with other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members. The activation of NLK contributes to the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), reducing c-myb expression and mechanistic target of rapamycin activity, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target. Unlike other anemias, the hematopoietic effects of DBA are largely restricted to the erythroid lineage. Mutations in ribosomal genes induce ribosomal insufficiency and reduced protein translation, dramatically impacting early erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of patients with DBA. We sought to identify compounds that suppress NLK and increases erythropoiesis in ribosomal insufficiency. We report that the active component of ginseng, ginsenoside Rb1, suppresses NLK expression and improves erythropoiesis in in vitro models of DBA. Ginsenoside Rb1-mediated suppression of NLK occurs through the upregulation of miR-208, which binds to the 3'-UTR of NLK mRNA and targets it for degradation. We also compare ginsenoside Rb1-mediated upregulation of miR-208 with metformin-mediated upregulation of miR-26. We conclude that targeting NLK expression through miRNA binding of the unique 3'-UTR is a viable alternative to the challenges of developing small-molecule inhibitors to target the highly conserved kinase domain of this specific kinase.

34343568	Cytokinesis, the final step of mitosis, is mediated by an actomyosin contractile ring, the formation of which is temporally and spatially regulated following anaphase onset. Aurora-B is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, which regulates various processes during mitosis; it is not understood, however, how Aurora-B is involved in cytokinesis. Here, we show that Aurora-B and myosin-IIB form a complex in vivo during telophase. Aurora-B phosphorylates the myosin-IIB rod domain at threonine 1847 (T(1847)), abrogating the ability of myosin-IIB monomers to form filaments. Furthermore, phosphorylation of myosin-IIB filaments by Aurora-B also promotes filament disassembly. We show that myosin-IIB possessing a phosphomimetic mutation at T(1847) was unable to rescue cytokinesis failure caused by myosin-IIB depletion. Cells expressing a phosphoresistant mutation at T(1847) had significantly longer intercellular bridges, implying that Aurora-B-mediated phosphorylation of myosin-IIB is important for abscission. We propose that myosin-IIB is a substrate of Aurora-B and reveal a new mechanism of myosin-IIB regulation by Aurora-B in the late stages of mitosis.	Aurora-B phosphorylates the myosin II heavy chain to promote cytokinesis.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34391782	Multifunctionality of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) comprising antiproteolytic as well as cytokinic activity has been attributed to its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. The molecular basis of the emerging proinflammatory cytokinic activity of TIMP-1 is still not completely understood. The cytokine receptor invariant chain (CD74) is involved in many inflammation-associated diseases and is highly expressed by immune cells. CD74 triggers zeta chain-associated protein kinase-70 (ZAP-70) signaling-associated activation upon interaction with its only known ligand, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Here, we demonstrate TIMP-1-CD74 interaction by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy in cells engineered to overexpress CD74. In silico docking in HADDOCK predicted regions of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 (N-TIMP-1) to interact with CD74. This was experimentally confirmed by confocal microscopy demonstrating that recombinant N-TIMP-1 lacking the entire C-terminal domain was sufficient to bind CD74. Interaction of TIMP-1 with endogenously expressed CD74 was demonstrated in the Namalwa B lymphoma cell line by dot blot binding assays as well as confocal microscopy. Functionally, we demonstrated that TIMP-1-CD74 interaction triggered intracellular ZAP-70 activation. N-TIMP-1 was sufficient to induce ZAP-70 activation and interference with the cytokine-binding site of CD74 using a synthetic peptide-abrogated TIMP-1-mediated ZAP-70 activation. Altogether, we here identified CD74 as a receptor and mediator of cytokinic TIMP-1 activity and revealed TIMP-1 as moonlighting protein harboring both cytokinic and antiproteolytic activity within its N-terminal domain. Recognition of this functional TIMP-1-CD74 interaction may shed new light on clinical attempts to therapeutically target ligand-induced CD74 activity in cancer and other inflammatory diseases.

34416231	The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein is a key player in tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was recently found to be inactivated by tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25)-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, the deubiquitinase (Dub) coordinate TRIM25 in PTEN ubiquitination is still elusive. In the present study, we found that this K63-linked polyubiquitination could be ablated by the ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) in a screen against a panel of Dubs. We found using coimmununoprecipitation/immunoblotting that USP10 interacted with PTEN and reduced the K63-linked polyubiquitination of PTEN mediated by TRIM25 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10, but not its inactive C424A deubiquitinating mutant or other Dubs, abolished PTEN from K63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by TRIM25. In contrast to TRIM25, USP10 restored PTEN phosphatase activity and reduced the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, thereby inhibiting AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin progrowth signaling transduction in NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10 was downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and primary tissues, whereas TRIM25 was upregulated. Consistent with its molecular activity, re-expression of USP10 suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockout of USP10 promoted NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that USP10 coordinates TRIM25 to modulate PTEN activity. Specifically, USP10 activates PTEN by preventing its K63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by TRIM25 and suppresses the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting NSCLC proliferation, indicating that it may be a potential drug target for cancer treatment.	The deubiquitinase USP10 restores PTEN activity and inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34375639	Mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism are essential for regulating the inflammatory state of monocytes. This state is partially controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), a coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Disruption of these processes can also contribute to the initiation of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-dependent N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation has recently been shown to regulate a variety of inflammatory processes. However, the role of m(6)A mRNA methylation in affecting mitochondrial metabolism in monocytes under inflammation is unclear, nor is there an established relationship between m(6)A methylation and PGC-1alpha. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism by which METTL3 acts during oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced monocyte inflammation, where METTL3 and YTH N(6)-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) cooperatively modify PGC-1alpha mRNA, mediating its degradation, decreasing PGC-1alpha protein levels, and thereby enhancing the inflammatory response. METTL3 coordinated with YTHDF2 to suppress the expression of PGC-1alpha, as well as that of cytochrome c (CYCS) and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2 (NDUFC2) and reduced ATP production and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). This subsequently increased the accumulation of cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in inflammatory monocytes. These data may provide new insights into the role of METTL3-dependent m(6)A modification of PGC-1alpha mRNA in the monocyte inflammation response. These data also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of monocyte-macrophage inflammation-associated diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

34358562	Protein acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification, which is regulated by lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and lysine deacetyltransferase (KDAC). Although protein acetylation has been shown to regulate synaptic plasticity, this was mainly for histone protein acetylation. The function and regulation of nonhistone protein acetylation in synaptic plasticity and learning remain largely unknown. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca(2+) sensor, plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). During LTP induction, activation of NMDA receptor triggers Ca(2+) influx, and the Ca(2+) binds with CaM and activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha). In our previous study, we demonstrated that acetylation of CaM was important for synaptic plasticity and fear learning in mice. However, the KAT responsible for CaM acetylation is currently unknown. Here, following an HEK293 cell-based screen of candidate KATs, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is identified as the most active KAT for CaM. We further demonstrate that SRC3 interacts with and acetylates CaM in a Ca(2+) and NMDA receptor-dependent manner. We also show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic downregulation of SRC3 impairs CaM acetylation, synaptic plasticity, and contextual fear learning in mice. Moreover, the effects of SRC3 inhibition on synaptic plasticity and fear learning could be rescued by 3KQ-CaM, a mutant form of CaM, which mimics acetylation. Together, these observations demonstrate that SRC3 acetylates CaM and regulates synaptic plasticity and learning in mice.	SRC3 acetylates calmodulin in the mouse brain to regulate synaptic plasticity and fear learning.	The Journal of biological chemistry
34270958	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of metabolism, inflammation, and cancer. In addition, the nutrient-sensing kinase 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of cellular energy in coordination with PPARdelta. However, the molecular mechanism of the AMPK/PPARdelta pathway on cancer progression is still unclear. Here, we found that activated AMPK induced PPARdelta-S50 phosphorylation in cancer cells, whereas the PPARdelta/S50A (nonphosphorylation mimic) mutant reversed this event. Further analysis showed that the PPARdelta/S50E (phosphorylation mimic) but not the PPARdelta/S50A mutant increased PPARdelta protein stability, which led to reduced p62/SQSTM1-mediated degradation of misfolded PPARdelta. Furthermore, PPARdelta-S50 phosphorylation decreased PPARdelta transcription activity and alleviated PPARdelta-mediated uptake of glucose and glutamine in cancer cells. Soft agar and xenograft tumor model analysis showed that the PPARdelta/S50E mutant but not the PPARdelta/S50A mutant inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, which was associated with inhibition of Glut1 and SLC1A5 transporter protein expression. These findings reveal a new mechanism of AMPK-induced PPARdelta-S50 phosphorylation, accumulation of misfolded PPARdelta protein, and inhibition of PPARdelta transcription activity contributing to the suppression of colon tumor formation.	AMPK phosphorylates PPARdelta to mediate its stabilization, inhibit glucose and glutamine uptake and colon tumor growth.	The Journal of biological chemistry
32941788	One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of approximately 17,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identify a natural variant in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients but also describe the emergence of natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with an extended ORF3b gene that may potentially affect COVID-19 pathogenesis.

32966793	The glyoxalase system is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed enzyme system, which is responsible for the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a spontaneous by-product of energy metabolism. This study is able to show that a phosphorylation of threonine-107 (T107) in the (rate-limiting) Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) protein, mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta (CamKIIdelta), is associated with elevated catalytic efficiency of Glo1 (lower KM; higher Vmax). Additionally, we observe proteasomal degradation of non-phosphorylated Glo1 via ubiquitination does occur more rapidly as compared with native Glo1. The absence of CamKIIdelta is associated with poor detoxification capacity and decreased protein content of Glo1 in a murine CamKIIdelta knockout model. Therefore, phosphorylation of T107 in the Glo1 protein by CamKIIdelta is a quick and precise mechanism regulating Glo1 activity, which is experimentally linked to an altered Glo1 status in cancer, diabetes, and during aging.	Phosphorylation of T107 by CamKIIdelta Regulates the Detoxification Efficiency and Proteomic Integrity of Glyoxalase 1.	Cell reports
32966797	Hemopexin (Hx) is a scavenger of labile heme. Herein, we present data defining the role of tumor stroma-expressed Hx in suppressing cancer progression. Labile heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Collectively, these results reveal that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme-driven tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/or arrest cancer dissemination.

32966780	FAM46C is a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase uniquely mutated in up to 20% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, implying a tissue-specific tumor suppressor function. Here, we report that FAM46C selectively stabilizes mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted proteins, thereby concertedly enhancing the expression of proteins that control ER protein import, folding, N-glycosylation, and trafficking and boosting protein secretion. This role requires the interaction with the ER membrane resident proteins FNDC3A and FNDC3B. In MM cells, FAM46C expression raises secretory capacity beyond sustainability, inducing ROS accumulation, ATP shortage, and cell death. FAM46C activity is regulated through rapid proteasomal degradation or the inhibitory interaction with the ZZ domain of the autophagic receptor p62 that hinders its association with FNDC3 proteins via sequestration in p62(+) aggregates. Altogether, our data disclose a p62/FAM46C/FNDC3 circuit coordinating sustainable secretory activity and survival, providing an explanation for the MM-specific oncosuppressive role of FAM46C and uncovering potential therapeutic opportunities against cancer.

32966783	To explore the mechanism of Rab5/RAB-5 activation during endocytic recycling, we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen and identify a recycling regulator, LET-502/ROCK. LET-502 preferentially interacts with RAB-5(GDP) and activates RABX-5 GEF activity toward RAB-5, presumably by disrupting the self-inhibiting conformation of RABX-5. Furthermore, we find that the concomitant loss of LET-502 and another CED-10 effector, TBC-2/RAB-5-GAP, results in an endosomal buildup of RAB-5, indicating that CED-10 directs TBC-2-mediated RAB-5 inactivation and re-activates RAB-5 via LET-502 afterward. Then, we compare the functional position of LET-502 with that of RME-6/RAB-5-GEF. Loss of LET-502-RABX-5 module or RME-6 leads to diminished RAB-5 presence in spatially distinct endosome groups. We conclude that in the intestine of C. elegans, RAB-5 resides in discrete endosome subpopulations. Under the oversight of CED-10, LET-502 synergizes with RABX-5 to revitalize RAB-5 on a subset of endosomes in the deep cytosol, ensuring the progress of basolateral recycling.

32997990	Nuclear actin has been elusive due to the lack of knowledge about molecular mechanisms. From actin-containing chromatin remodeling complexes, we discovered an arginine mono-methylation mark on an evolutionarily conserved R256 residue of actin (R256me1). Actin R256 mutations in yeast affect nuclear functions and cause diseases in human. Interestingly, we show that an antibody specific for actin R256me1 preferentially stains nuclear actin over cytoplasmic actin in yeast, mouse, and human cells. We also show that actin R256me1 is regulated by protein arginine methyl transferase-5 (PRMT5) in HEK293 cells. A genome-wide survey of actin R256me1 mark provides a landscape for nuclear actin correlated with transcription. Further, gene expression and protein interaction studies uncover extensive correlations between actin R256me1 and active transcription. The discovery of actin R256me1 mark suggests a fundamental mechanism to distinguish nuclear actin from cytoplasmic actin through post-translational modification (PTM) and potentially implicates an actin PTM mark in transcription and human diseases.

32997987	Kinetochores are macromolecular protein assemblies at centromeres that mediate accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The outer kinetochore KNL1(SPC105), MIS12(MTW1), and NDC80(NDC80) complexes assemble the KMN network, which harbors the sites of microtubule binding and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. The buildup of the KMN network that transmits microtubule pulling forces to budding yeast point centromeres is poorly understood. Here, we identify 225 inter-protein crosslinks by mass spectrometry on KMN complexes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that delineate the KMN subunit connectivity for outer kinetochore assembly. C-Terminal motifs of Nsl1 and Mtw1 recruit the SPC105 complex through Kre28, and both motifs aid tethering of the NDC80 complex by the previously reported Dsn1 C terminus. We show that a hub of three C-terminal MTW1 subunit motifs mediates the cooperative stabilization of the KMN network, which is augmented by a direct NDC80-SPC105 association.

32997997	Uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors induces leukemia. To self-renew, leukemia cells must continuously activate genes that were previously active in their mother cells. Here, we describe the circuitry of a transactivation system responsible for oncogenic self-renewal. MLL recruits RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters by its CXXC domain and activates transcription by transcriptional regulators, including the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex, DOT1L, and p300/CBP histone acetyl transferases. MOZ also targets a broad range of CpG-rich promoters through association with RNAP2 and MLL. Leukemic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AFX constitutively activate CpG-rich promoters by aberrantly recruiting p300/CBP. Pharmacological inhibition of MLL or DOT1L induces differentiation of MOZ-TIF2-transformed cells. These results reveal that activation of unmethylated CpG-rich promoters mediated by MLL is the central mechanism of oncogenic self-renewal in MOZ-rearranged leukemia and indicate that the molecularly targeted therapies intended for MLL-rearranged leukemia can be applied for MOZ-rearranged leukemia.

33027649	The Mediator complex relays regulatory signals from gene-specific transcription factors to the basal transcriptional machinery. However, the role of individual Mediator subunits in different tissues remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MED19 is essential for adipogenesis and maintenance of white adipose tissue (WAT) by mediating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcriptional activity. MED19 knockdown blocks white adipogenesis, but not brown adipogenesis or C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Adipose-specific MED19 knockout (KO) in mice results in a striking loss of WAT, whitening of brown fat, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Inducible adipose-specific MED19 KO in adult animals also results in lipodystrophy, demonstrating its requirement for WAT maintenance. Global gene expression analysis reveals induction of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation and impaired expression of adipose-specific genes, resulting from decreased PPARgamma residency on adipocyte gene promoters and reduced association of PPARgamma with RNA polymerase II. These results identify MED19 as a crucial facilitator of PPARgamma-mediated gene expression in adipose tissue.

33027666	mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Raptor, a scaffolding protein that recruits substrates to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), is known to be phosphorylated during mitosis, but the significance of this phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that raptor expression and mTORC1 activity are dramatically reduced in cells arrested in mitosis. Expression of a non-phosphorylatable raptor mutant reactivates mTORC1 and significantly reduces cytotoxicity of the mitotic poison Taxol. This effect is mediated via degradation of PDCD4, a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits eIF4A activity and is negatively regulated by the mTORC1/S6K pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A is able to enhance the effects of Taxol and restore sensitivity in Taxol-resistant cancer cells. These findings indicate that the mTORC1/S6K/PDCD4/eIF4A axis has a pivotal role in the death versus slippage decision during mitotic arrest and may be exploited clinically to treat tumors resistant to anti-mitotic agents.

32979938	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and host immune response determine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but studies evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here, we use unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation, and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds importin Karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We identify two sets of viral proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 suppress IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a SARS-CoV-2 replicon replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2 evasion of IFN-I response and its potential impact on viral transmission and pathogenesis.	Evasion of Type I Interferon by SARS-CoV-2.

33027667	Despite the important roles of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) and transient receptor potential vanilloind 1 (TRPV1) in inflammatory hypersensitivity, how PKCepsilon is involved in the regulation of thermal hyperalgesia is not fully understood. We report here that PKCepsilon is SUMOylated at a C-terminal lysine residue (K534), which enhances the sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel. We demonstrate that PKCepsilon phosphorylation promotes its SUMOylation, which in turn regulates the phosphorylation level of TRPV1 serine 800 residue via controlling the binding of PKCepsilon and TRPV1 and increased PKCepsilon kinase activity. More importantly, the reduced ability of PKCepsilon knockdown mice to develop inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia was rescued by viral infection of lumbar 4/5 dorsal root ganglia neurons of wild-type PKCepsilon, but not the SUMOylation-deficient PKCepsilon mutant. Therefore, the SUMOylation of PKCepsilon potentiates inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia through stabilizing the interaction with TRPV1 to enhance its function by phosphorylation.	PKCepsilon SUMOylation Is Required for Mediating the Nociceptive Signaling of Inflammatory Pain.	Cell reports
33053360	Here, we ask how neural stem cells (NSCs) transition in the developing neocortex from a rapidly to a slowly proliferating state, a process required to maintain lifelong stem cell pools. We identify LRIG1, known to regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in other cell types, as a negative regulator of cortical NSC proliferation. LRIG1 is expressed in murine cortical NSCs as they start to proliferate more slowly during embryogenesis and then peaks postnatally when they transition to give rise to a portion of adult NSCs. Constitutive or acute loss of Lrig1 in NSCs over this developmental time frame causes stem cell expansion due to increased proliferation. LRIG1 controls NSC proliferation by associating with and negatively regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These data support a model in which LRIG1 dampens the stem cell response to EGFR ligands within the cortical environment to slow their proliferation as they transition to postnatal adult NSCs.

33053355	Current models of mRNA turnover indicate that cytoplasmic degradation is coupled with translation. However, our understanding of the molecular events that coordinate ribosome transit with the mRNA decay machinery is still limited. Here, we show that 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes trigger co-translational mRNA decay. Human cells lacking these proteins accumulate mRNAs with prominent ribosome pausing. They include, among others, transcripts encoding secretory and membrane-bound proteins or tubulin subunits. In addition, 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes fail to reduce mRNA levels in the absence of ribosome stalling or upon disruption of their interaction with the cap structure, DDX6, and ZNF598. We further find that co-translational binding of GIGYF1/2 to the mRNA marks transcripts with perturbed elongation to decay. Our studies reveal how a repressor complex linked to neurological disorders minimizes the protein output of a subset of mRNAs.	4EHP and GIGYF1/2 Mediate Translation-Coupled Messenger RNA Decay.

33053339	While plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to potentiate cellular migration via proteolytic regulation, this adipokine is implicated as an oncogenic ligand in the tumor microenvironment. To understand the underlying paracrine mechanism, here, we conduct transcriptomic analysis of 1,898 endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) exposed and unexposed to PAI-1-secreting adipose stromal cells. The PAI-1-dependent action deregulates crosstalk among tumor-promoting and tumor-repressing pathways, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). When PAI-1 is tethered to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), the internalized signaling causes downregulation of SMAD4 at the transcriptional and post-translational levels that attenuates TGF-beta-related transcription programs. Repression of genes encoding the junction and adhesion complex preferentially occurs in SMAD4-underexpressed EECs of persons with obesity. The findings highlight a role of PAI-1 signaling that renders ineffective intercellular communication for the development of adiposity-associated endometrial cancer.

33086067	Hhex encodes a homeobox transcriptional regulator important for embryonic development and hematopoiesis. Hhex is highly expressed in NK cells, and its germline deletion results in significant defects in lymphoid development, including NK cells. To determine if Hhex is intrinsically required throughout NK cell development or for NK cell function, we generate mice that specifically lack Hhex in NK cells. NK cell frequency is dramatically reduced, while NK cell differentiation, IL-15 responsiveness, and function at the cellular level remain largely normal in the absence of Hhex. Increased IL-15 availability fails to fully reverse NK lymphopenia following conditional Hhex deletion, suggesting that Hhex regulates developmental pathways extrinsic to those dependent on IL-15. Gene expression and functional genetic approaches reveal that Hhex regulates NK cell survival by directly binding Bcl2l11 (Bim) and repressing expression of this key apoptotic mediator. These data implicate Hhex as a transcriptional regulator of NK cell homeostasis and immunity.	Hhex Directly Represses BIM-Dependent Apoptosis to Promote NK Cell Development and Maintenance.

33086065	TMEM18 is the strongest candidate for childhood obesity identified from GWASs, yet as for most GWAS-derived obesity-susceptibility genes, the functional mechanism remains elusive. We here investigate the relevance of TMEM18 for adipose tissue development and obesity. We demonstrate that adipocyte TMEM18 expression is downregulated in children with obesity. Functionally, downregulation of TMEM18 impairs adipocyte formation in zebrafish and in human preadipocytes, indicating that TMEM18 is important for adipocyte differentiation in vivo and in vitro. On the molecular level, TMEM18 activates PPARG, particularly upregulating PPARG1 promoter activity, and this activation is repressed by inflammatory stimuli. The relationship between TMEM18 and PPARG1 is also evident in adipocytes of children and is clinically associated with obesity and adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Our findings indicate a role of TMEM18 as an upstream regulator of PPARG signaling driving healthy adipogenesis, which is dysregulated with adipose tissue dysfunction and obesity.

33147467	The germinal center (GC) reaction is essential for long-lived humoral immunity. However, molecular requirements for the induction of Bcl6, the master regulator for GC B cell differentiation, remain unclear. Through screening for cytokines and other stimuli that regulate Bcl6 expression, we identify IL-4 as the strongest inducer. IL-4 signaling alters the metabolomic profile in activated B cells and induces accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG), which is required for activation of the Bcl6 gene locus. Mechanistically, after IL-4 treatment, STAT6 bound to the known enhancers in the Bcl6 locus recruits UTX, a demethylase for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 that requires alphaKG as a cofactor. In turn, the H3K27me3 demethylation activates the enhancers and transcription of the Bcl6 gene. We propose that IL-4-mediated metabolic reprogramming in B cells is pivotal for epigenomic activation of Bcl6 expression to promote GC B cell differentiation.

33086059	The immune system is not only required for preventing threats exerted by pathogens but also essential for developing immune tolerance to avoid tissue damage. This study identifies a distinct mechanism by which MYSM1 suppresses innate immunity and autoimmunity. The expression of MYSM1 is induced upon DNA virus infection and by intracellular DNA stimulation. MYSM1 subsequently interacts with STING and cleaves STING K63-linked ubiquitination to suppress cGAS-STING signaling. Notably, Mysm1-deficient mice exhibit a hyper-inflammatory response, acute tissue damage, and high mortality upon virus infection. Moreover, in the PBMCs of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), MYSM1 production decreases, while type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions increase. Importantly, MYSM1 treatment represses the production of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of SLE patients. Thus, MYSM1 is a critical repressor of innate immunity and autoimmunity and is thus a potential therapeutic agent for infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.

33086058	Cytosolic proteins are required for regulation of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (Nox) isozymes. Here we show that Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing YSC84-like 1 (SH3YL1), as a Nox4 cytosolic regulator, mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced H2O2 generation, leading to acute kidney injury. The SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE proteins (SYLF) region and SH3 domain of SH3YL1 contribute to formation of a complex with Nox4-p22(phox). Interaction of p22(phox) with SH3YL1 is triggered by LPS, and the complex induces H2O2 generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in mouse tubular epithelial cells. After LPS injection, SH3YL1 knockout mice show lower levels of acute kidney injury biomarkers, decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased infiltration of macrophages, and reduced tubular damage compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The results strongly suggest that SH3YL1 is involved in renal failure in LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mice. We demonstrate that formation of a ternary complex of p22(phox)-SH3YL1-Nox4, leading to H2O2 generation, induces severe renal failure in the LPS-induced AKI model.

33086070	The Hippo signaling pathway maintains organ size and tissue homeostasis via orchestration of cell proliferation and apoptosis. How this pathway triggers cell apoptosis remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify NR4A1 as a target of the Hippo pathway that mediates the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effects of the Hippo pathway whereby YAP regulates the transcription, phosphorylation, and mitochondrial localization of NR4A1. NR4A1, in turn, functions as a feedback inhibitor of YAP to promote its degradation, thereby inhibiting the function of YAP during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis. Our studies elucidate a regulatory loop between NR4A1 and YAP to coordinate Hippo signaling activity during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis and highlight NR4A1 as a marker of Hippo signaling, as well as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

33086055	MutSalpha and MutSbeta play important roles in DNA mismatch repair and are linked to inheritable cancers and degenerative disorders. Here, we show that MSH2 and MSH3, the two components of MutSbeta, bind SLX4 protein, a scaffold for the assembly of the SLX1-SLX4-MUS81-EME1-XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex. SMX promotes the resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs), which are intermediates in homologous recombinational repair. We find that MutSbeta binds HJs and stimulates their resolution by SLX1-SLX4 or SMX in reactions dependent upon direct interactions between MutSbeta and SLX4. In contrast, MutSalpha does not stimulate HJ resolution. MSH3-depleted cells exhibit reduced sister chromatid exchanges and elevated levels of homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) at mitosis, consistent with defects in the processing of recombination intermediates. These results demonstrate a role for MutSbeta in addition to its established role in the pathogenic expansion of CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats, which is causative of myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease.

33147459	Bioenergetic reprogramming during hypoxia adaption is critical to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and progression. However, the mechanism underlying the orchestration of mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) and glycolysis in hypoxia is not fully understood. Here, we report that mitochondrial UQCC3 (C11orf83) expression increases in hypoxia and correlates with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Loss of UQCC3 impairs HCC cell proliferation in hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UQCC3 forms a positive feedback loop with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) to sustain UQCC3 expression and ROS generation in hypoxic HCC cells and subsequently maintains mitochondrial structure and function and stabilizes HIF-1alpha expression to enhance glycolysis under hypoxia. Thus, UQCC3 plays an indispensable role for bioenergetic reprogramming of HCC cells during hypoxia adaption by simultaneously regulating OXPHOS and glycolysis. The positive feedback between UQCC3 and ROS indicates a self-modulating model within mitochondria that initiates the adaptation of HCC to hypoxic stress.

33147463	Dysregulated gene expression is a common feature of cancer and may underlie some aspects of tumor progression, including tumor relapse. Here, we show that recurrent mammary tumors exhibit global changes in gene expression and histone modifications and acquire dependence on the G9a histone methyltransferase. Genetic ablation of G9a delays tumor recurrence, and pharmacologic inhibition of G9a slows the growth of recurrent tumors. Mechanistically, G9a activity is required to silence pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), through H3K9 methylation at gene promoters. G9a inhibition induces re-expression of these cytokines, leading to p53 activation and necroptosis. Recurrent tumors upregulate receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) expression and are dependent upon RIPK3 activity. High RIPK3 expression renders recurrent tumors sensitive to necroptosis following G9a inhibition. These findings demonstrate that G9a-mediated silencing of pro-necroptotic proteins is a critical step in tumor recurrence and suggest that G9a is a targetable dependency in recurrent breast cancer.

33147457	We report here that the autocrine signaling mediated by growth and differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of cytokines, maintains Ewing sarcoma growth by preventing Src hyperactivation. Surprisingly, Ewing sarcoma depends on the prodomain, not the BMP domain, of GDF6. We demonstrate that the GDF6 prodomain is a ligand for CD99, a transmembrane protein that has been widely used as a marker of Ewing sarcoma. The binding of the GDF6 prodomain to the CD99 extracellular domain results in recruitment of CSK (C-terminal Src kinase) to the YQKKK motif in the intracellular domain of CD99, inhibiting Src activity. GDF6 silencing causes hyperactivation of Src and p21-dependent growth arrest. We demonstrate that two GDF6 prodomain mutants linked to Klippel-Feil syndrome are hyperactive in CD99-Src signaling. These results reveal a cytokine signaling pathway that regulates the CSK-Src axis and cancer cell proliferation and suggest the gain-of-function activity for disease-causing GDF6 mutants.

33176141	Nerve injury in somatosensory pathways may lead to neuropathic pain, which affects the life quality of approximately 8% of people. Long-term enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission along somatosensory pathways contributes to neuropathic pain. Caspase 3 (Casp3) plays a non-apoptotic role in the hippocampus and regulates internalization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits. Whether Casp3-AMPAR interaction is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury remained unknown. Here, we show that nerve injury suppresses long-term depression (LTD) and downregulates Casp3 in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Interfering with interactions between Casp3 and AMPAR subunits or reducing Casp3 activity in the ACC suppresses LTD induction and causes peripheral hypersensitivity. Overexpression of Casp3 restores LTD and reduces peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. We reveal how Casp3 is involved in the maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that restoration of LTD via Casp3 provides a therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain management.

33176142	Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that function in a multitude of physiological contexts to perform chemosensing, mechanosensing, and fluid propulsion. The process of ciliogenesis is highly regulated, and disruptions result in disease states termed ciliopathies. Here, we report that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (ppargc1a) is essential for ciliogenesis in nodal, mono-, and multiciliated cells (MCCs) and for discernment of renal tubule ciliated cell fate during embryogenesis. ppargc1a performs these functions by affecting prostaglandin signaling, whereby cilia formation and renal MCC fate are restored with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment in ppargc1a-deficient animals. Genetic disruption of ppargc1a specifically reduces expression of the prostanoid biosynthesis gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (ptgs1), and suboptimal knockdown of both genes shows this synergistic effect. Furthermore, ptgs1 overexpression rescues ciliogenesis and renal MCCs in ppargc1a-deficient embryos. These findings position Ppargc1a as a key genetic regulator of prostaglandin signaling during ciliated cell ontogeny.

33176146	Tissue injury is one of the most severe environmental perturbations for a living organism. When damage occurs in adult Drosophila, there is a local response of the injured tissue and a coordinated action across different tissues to help the organism overcome the deleterious effect of an injury. We show a change in the transcriptome of hemocytes at the site of tissue injury, with pronounced activation of the Toll signaling pathway. We find that induction of the cytokine upd-3 and Toll receptor activation occur in response to injury alone, in the absence of a pathogen. Intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in hemocytes is essential for upd-3 induction and is facilitated by the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide through a channel protein Prip. Importantly, hemocyte activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the site of a sterile injury provide protection to flies on subsequent infection, demonstrating training of the innate immune system.

33176151	Transcription factor EB (TFEB) activates lysosomal biogenesis genes in response to environmental cues. Given implications of impaired TFEB signaling and lysosomal dysfunction in metabolic, neurological, and infectious diseases, we aim to systematically identify TFEB-directed circuits by examining transcriptional responses to TFEB subcellular localization and stimulation. We reveal that steady-state nuclear TFEB is sufficient to activate transcription of lysosomal, autophagy, and innate immunity genes, whereas other targets require higher thresholds of stimulation. Furthermore, we identify shared and distinct transcriptional signatures between mTOR inhibition and bacterial autophagy. Using a genome-wide CRISPR library, we find TFEB targets that protect cells from or sensitize cells to lysosomal cell death. BHLHE40 and BHLHE41, genes responsive to high, sustained levels of nuclear TFEB, act in opposition to TFEB upon lysosomal cell death induction. Further investigation identifies genes counter-regulated by TFEB and BHLHE40/41, adding this negative feedback to the current understanding of TFEB regulatory mechanisms.

33207203	The Drosophila midgut is an excellent system for characterizing cell cycle regulation in the context of tissue homeostasis. Two major progenitor cell types populate the midgut: mitotic intestinal stem cells and their post-mitotic daughters, enteroblasts. Although regulatory networks that control stem cell proliferation are well characterized, how enteroblast mitotic-cell-cycle exit is coordinated with endocycle entry and enterocyte specification remains poorly defined. Myt1 is a conserved Cdk1 inhibitory kinase that regulates mitotic timing during animal development. Here, we use myt1-null mutants and cell-specific RNA interference to investigate Myt1 function in stem cells and enteroblast progenitors. Myt1 depletion alters cell cycle kinetics and promotes ectopic stem cell and enteroblast mitoses at the expense of enteroblast-enterocyte differentiation. These aberrant enteroblast mitoses rely upon cyclin A, implicating Myt1 inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk1 as a mechanism for the coupling mitotic exit with differentiation in enteroblasts.

33207199	After optic nerve crush (ONC), the cell bodies and distal axons of most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) degenerate. RGC somal and distal axon degenerations were previously thought to be controlled by two parallel pathways, involving activation of the kinase dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and loss of the axon survival factor nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-2 (NMNAT2), respectively. Here, we report that palmitoylation of both DLK and NMNAT2 by the palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC17 couples these signals. ZDHHC17-dependent palmitoylation enables DLK-dependent somal degeneration after ONC and also ensures NMNAT-dependent distal axon integrity in healthy optic nerves. We provide evidence that ZDHHC17 also controls survival-versus-degeneration decisions in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we identify conserved motifs in NMNAT2 and DLK that govern their ZDHHC17-dependent regulation. These findings suggest that the control of somal and distal axon integrity should be considered as a single, holistic process, mediated by the concerted action of two palmitoylation-dependent pathways.

33207200	The NLRP3 inflammasome, a critical component of the innate immune system, induces caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1beta maturation in response to microbial infection and cellular damage. However, aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we identify the receptor for activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) as a component of the NLRP3 complexes in macrophages. RACK1 interacts with NLRP3 and NEK7 but not ASC. Suppression of RACK1 expression abrogates caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta release in response to NLRP3- but not NLRC4- or AIM2-activating stimuli. This RACK1 function is independent of its ribosomal binding activity. Mechanistically, RACK1 promotes the active conformation of NLRP3 induced by activating stimuli and subsequent inflammasome assembly. These results demonstrate that RACK1 is a critical mediator for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

33238115	Unveiling the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration provides new opportunities to develop treatments for diabetic ulcers and other chronic skin lesions. Here, we show that Ccl2 secretion by epidermal keratinocytes is directly orchestrated by Nrf2, a prominent transcriptional regulator of tissue regeneration that is activated early after cutaneous injury. Through a unique feedback mechanism, we find that Ccl2 from epidermal keratinocytes not only drives chemotaxis of macrophages into the wound but also triggers macrophage expression of EGF, which in turn activates basal epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. Notably, we find dysfunctional activation of Nrf2 in epidermal keratinocytes of diabetic mice after wounding, which partly explains regenerative impairments associated with diabetes. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the critical relationship between keratinocyte and macrophage signaling during tissue repair, providing the basis for continued investigation of the therapeutic value of Nrf2.

33238122	Gene expression is controlled by the collective binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory regions. Deciphering gene-centered regulatory networks is vital to understanding and controlling gene misexpression in human disease; however, systematic approaches to uncovering regulatory networks have been lacking. Here we present high-throughput interrogation of gene-centered activation networks (HIGAN), a pipeline that employs a suite of multifaceted genomic approaches to connect upstream signaling inputs, trans-acting TFs, and cis-regulatory elements. We apply HIGAN to understand the aberrant activation of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B, an intrinsic source of cancer hypermutation. We reveal that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and AP-1 pathways are the most salient trans-acting inputs, with minor roles for other inflammatory pathways. We identify a cis-regulatory architecture dominated by a major intronic enhancer that requires coordinated NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity with secondary inputs from distal regulatory regions. Our data demonstrate how integration of cis and trans genomic screening platforms provides a paradigm for building gene-centered regulatory networks.

33264610	The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) signalosome is essential for B cell maturation. Proper signaling strength is maintained through the PI3K negative regulator phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Although a role for microRNA (miRNA)-dependent control of the PTEN-PI3K axis has been described, the contribution of individual miRNAs to the regulation of this crucial signaling modality in mature B lymphocytes remains to be elucidated. Our analyses reveal that ablation of miR-29 specifically in B lymphocytes results in an increase in PTEN expression and dampening of the PI3K pathway in mature B cells. This dysregulation has a profound impact on the survival of B lymphocytes and results in increased class switch recombination and decreased plasma cell differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ablation of one copy of Pten is sufficient to ameliorate the phenotypes associated with miR-29 loss. Our data suggest a critical role for the miR-29-PTEN-PI3K regulatory axis in mature B lymphocytes.	miR-29 Sustains B Cell Survival and Controls Terminal Differentiation via Regulation of PI3K Signaling.

33264621	The widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are derivatives of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). SA is well known to regulate plant immunity and development, whereas there have been few reports focusing on the effects of NSAIDs in plants. Our studies here reveal that NSAIDs exhibit largely overlapping physiological activities to SA in the model plant Arabidopsis. NSAID treatments lead to shorter and agravitropic primary roots and inhibited lateral root organogenesis. Notably, in addition to the SA-like action, which in roots involves binding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), NSAIDs also exhibit PP2A-independent effects. Cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that many NSAIDs bind directly to and inhibit the chaperone activity of TWISTED DWARF1, thereby regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and subsequent endosomal trafficking. Our findings uncover an unexpected bioactivity of human pharmaceuticals in plants and provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the cellular action of this class of anti-inflammatory compounds.

33296645	Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of programed cell death caused by the metabolically regulated lipid peroxidation and holds promise for cancer treatment, but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we observe that lactate-rich liver cancer cells exhibit enhanced resistance to the ferroptotic damage induced by common ferroptosis inducers such as Ras-selective lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) and Erastin and that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated lactate uptake could promote ATP production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and deactivate the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the downstream stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1 (SCD1) to enhance the production of anti-ferroptosis monounsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, blocking the lactate uptake via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1)/MCT1 inhibition promotes ferroptosis by activating the AMPK to downregulate SCD1, which may synergize with its acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-promoting effect to amplify the ferroptotic susceptibility. In vitro and in vivo evidence confirms that lactate regulates the ferroptosis of HCC cells and highlights its translational potential as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis-based tumor treatment.

33296647	Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS), upon sensing cytosolic DNA, catalyzes the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which activates STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling. cGAS is also present in the nucleus, but the relevant nuclear function or mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that nuclear cGAS is indispensable for inducing cytokines and chemokines triggered by RNA/DNA viruses. Unexpectedly, the DNA-binding/nucleotidyltransferase activity of cGAS is dispensable for RNA-virus-induced genes expression. cGAS deficiency does not affect the phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mechanistically, nuclear-localized cGAS interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5), which catalyzes the symmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 at Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters, thus facilitating the access of IRF3. Deficiency of Prmt5 or disrupting its catalytic activity suppresses the production of type I interferons (IFNs), impairing the host defenses against RNA/DNA virus infections. Taken together, our study uncovers a non-canonical function of nuclear-localized cGAS in innate immunity via regulating histone arginine modification.

33326784	Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with the capacity to elicit adaptive features, including clonal expansion and immunological memory. Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is essential for NK cell development, the roles of this transcription factor and its upstream cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 during infection have not been carefully investigated. In this study, we investigate how STAT5 regulates transcription during viral infection. We demonstrate that STAT5 is induced in NK cells by IL-12 and STAT4 early after infection and that partial STAT5 deficiency results in a defective capacity of NK cells to generate long-lived memory cells. Furthermore, we find a functional dichotomy of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling outputs during viral infection, whereby both cytokines drive clonal expansion, but only IL-15 is required for memory NK cell survival. We thus highlight a role for STAT5 signaling in promoting an optimal anti-viral NK cell response.	Divergent Role for STAT5 in the Adaptive Responses of Natural Killer Cells.	Cell reports
33357429	Cytokines are highly pleiotropic ligands that regulate the immune response. Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4(+) T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.

33357426	The chromatin protein positive coactivator 4 (PC4) has multiple functions, including chromatin compaction. However, its role in immune cells is largely unknown. We show that PC4 orchestrates chromatin structure and gene expression in mature B cells. B-cell-specific PC4-deficient mice show impaired production of antibody upon antigen stimulation. The PC4 complex purified from B cells contains the transcription factors (TFs) IKAROS and IRF4. IKAROS protein is reduced in PC4-deficient mature B cells, resulting in de-repression of their target genes in part by diminished interactions with gene-silencing components. Upon activation, the amount of IRF4 protein is not increased in PC4-deficient B cells, resulting in reduction of plasma cells. Importantly, IRF4 reciprocally induces PC4 expression via a super-enhancer. PC4 knockdown in human B cell lymphoma and myeloma cells reduces IKAROS protein as an anticancer drug, lenalidomide. Our findings establish PC4 as a chromatin regulator of B cells and a possible therapeutic target adjoining IKAROS in B cell malignancies.

33357430	During chronic infection, the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNgamma) damages hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by disrupting quiescence and promoting excessive terminal differentiation. However, the mechanism by which IFNgamma hinders HSC quiescence remains undefined. Using intravital 3-dimensional microscopy, we find that IFNgamma disrupts the normally close interaction between HSCs and CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the HSC niche. IFNgamma stimulation increases expression of the cell surface protein BST2, which we find is required for IFNgamma-dependent HSC relocalization and activation. IFNgamma stimulation of HSCs increases their E-selectin binding by BST2 and homing to the bone marrow, which depends on E-selectin binding. Upon chronic infection, HSCs from mice lacking BST2 are more quiescent and more resistant to depletion than HSCs from wild-type mice. Overall, this study defines a critical mechanism by which IFNgamma promotes niche relocalization and activation in response to inflammatory stimulation and identifies BST2 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence.

33378666	The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) controls cell metabolism and survival in response to environmental inputs. Dysregulation of mTORC2 signaling has been linked to diverse human diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting the importance of a tightly controlled mTORC2. While mTORC2 assembly is a critical determinant of its activity, the factors regulating this event are not well understood, and it is unclear whether this process is regulated by growth factors. Here, we present data, from human cell lines and mice, describing a mechanism by which growth factors regulate ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) deubiquitinase to stimulate mTORC2 assembly and activity. USP9X removes Lys63-linked ubiquitin from RICTOR to promote its interaction with mTOR, thereby facilitating mTORC2 signaling. As mTORC2 is central for cellular homeostasis, understanding the mechanisms regulating mTORC2 activation toward its downstream targets is vital for our understanding of physiological processes and for developing new therapeutic strategies in pathology.	mTORC2 Assembly Is Regulated by USP9X-Mediated Deubiquitination of RICTOR.

33378676	"The present study demonstrates that topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) forms both RNA and DNA cleavage complexes (TOP3Bccs) in vivo and reveals a pathway for repairing TOP3Bccs. For inducing and detecting cellular TOP3Bccs, we engineer a ""self-trapping"" mutant of TOP3B (R338W-TOP3B). Transfection with R338W-TOP3B induces R-loops, genomic damage, and growth defect, which highlights the importance of TOP3Bcc repair mechanisms. To determine how cells repair TOP3Bccs, we deplete tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDP1 and TDP2). TDP2-deficient cells show elevated TOP3Bccs both in DNA and RNA. Conversely, overexpression of TDP2 lowers cellular TOP3Bccs. Using recombinant human TDP2, we demonstrate that TDP2 can process both denatured and proteolyzed TOP3Bccs. We also show that cellular TOP3Bccs are ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase TRIM41 before undergoing proteasomal processing and excision by TDP2."

33378683	Altering ubiquitination by disruption of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) affects hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. However, comprehensive knowledge of DUB function during hematopoiesis in vivo is lacking. Here, we systematically inactivate DUBs in mouse hematopoietic progenitors using in vivo small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screens. We find that multiple DUBs may be individually required for hematopoiesis and identify ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as essential for HSC maintenance in vitro and in transplantations and Usp15 knockout (KO) mice in vivo. USP15 is highly expressed in human hematopoietic tissues and leukemias. USP15 depletion in murine progenitors and leukemia cells impairs in vitro expansion and increases genotoxic stress. In leukemia cells, USP15 interacts with and stabilizes FUS (fused in sarcoma), a known DNA repair factor, directly linking USP15 to the DNA damage response (DDR). Our study underscores the importance of DUBs in preserving normal hematopoiesis and uncovers USP15 as a critical DUB in safeguarding genome integrity in HSCs and leukemia cells.

33378667	Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate IRE1alpha endoribonuclease in mammalian cells, which mediates XBP1 mRNA splicing to produce an active transcription factor. This promotes the expression of specific genes to alleviate ER stress, thereby attenuating IRE1alpha. Although sustained activation of IRE1alpha is linked to human diseases, it is not clear how IRE1alpha is attenuated during ER stress. Here, we identify that Sec63 is a subunit of the previously identified IRE1alpha/Sec61 translocon complex. We find that Sec63 recruits and activates BiP ATPase through its luminal J-domain to bind onto IRE1alpha. This leads to inhibition of higher-order oligomerization and attenuation of IRE1alpha RNase activity during prolonged ER stress. In Sec63-deficient cells, IRE1alpha remains activated for a long period of time despite the presence of excess BiP in the ER. Thus, our data suggest that the Sec61 translocon bridges IRE1alpha with Sec63/BiP to regulate the dynamics of IRE1alpha signaling in cells.

33406430	Early lineage-specific master regulators are essential for the specification of cell types. However, once cells are committed to a specific fate, it is critical to restrict the activity of such factors to enable differentiation. To date, it remains unclear how these factors are silenced. Using the Drosophila mesoderm as a model and a comparative genomic approach, we identify the Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) to be critical for the repression of the master regulator Twist. Mesoderm-specific Ubx loss-of-function experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 and overexpression studies demonstrate that Ubx majorly impacts twist transcription. A mechanistic analysis reveals that Ubx requires the NK-homeodomain protein Tinman to bind to the twist promoter. Furthermore, we find these factor interactions to be critical for silencing by recruiting the Polycomb DNA binding protein Pleiohomeotic. Altogether, our data reveal that Ubx is a critical player in mediating the silencing of Twist, which is crucial for coordinated muscle differentiation.

33406428	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report a key beta cell-macrophage crosstalk pathway mediated by the miRNA-29-TNF-receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) axis. beta cell-specific transgenic miR-29a/b/c mice are predisposed to develop glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The metabolic effect of beta cell miR-29 is largely mediated through macrophages because either depletion of macrophages or reconstitution with miR-29-signaling defective bone marrow improves metabolic parameters in the transgenic mice. Mechanistically, our data show that miR-29 promotes the recruitment and activation of circulating monocytes and macrophages and, hence, inflammation, via miR-29 exosomes in a TRAF3-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate the ability of beta cells to modulate the systemic inflammatory tone and glucose homeostasis via miR-29 in response to nutrient overload.

33406413	Potent therapeutic inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate adenocarcinoma can lead to the emergence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a phenomenon associated with enhanced cell plasticity. Here, we show that microRNA-194 (miR-194) is a regulator of epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. In clinical prostate cancer samples, miR-194 expression and activity were elevated in NEPC and inversely correlated with AR signaling. miR-194 facilitated the emergence of neuroendocrine features in prostate cancer cells, a process mediated by its ability to directly target a suite of genes involved in cell plasticity. One such target was FOXA1, which encodes a transcription factor with a vital role in maintaining the prostate epithelial lineage. Importantly, a miR-194 inhibitor blocked epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation and inhibited the growth of cell lines and patient-derived organoids possessing neuroendocrine features. Overall, our study reveals a post-transcriptional mechanism regulating the plasticity of prostate cancer cells and provides a rationale for targeting miR-194 in NEPC.

33406417	Piwi proteins are a subfamily of Argonaute proteins that maintain germ cells in eukaryotes. However, the role of their human homologs in cancer stem cells, and more broadly in cancer, is poorly understood. Here, we report that Piwi-like family members are overexpressed in glioblastoma (GBM), with Piwil1 (Hiwi) most frequently overexpressed (88%). Piwil1 is enriched in glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) to maintain self-renewal. Silencing Piwil1 in GSCs leads to global changes in gene expression resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. Piwil1 knockdown increases expression of the transcriptional co-regulator BTG2 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, leading to reduced c-Myc expression, as well as loss of expression of stem cell factors Olig2 and Nestin. Piwil1 regulates mRNA stability of BTG2, FBXW7, and CDKN1B. In animal models of GBM, Piwil1 knockdown suppresses tumor growth and promotes mouse survival. These findings support a role of Piwil1 in GSC maintenance and glioblastoma progression.	Piwil1 Regulates Glioma Stem Cell Maintenance and Glioblastoma Progression.	Cell reports
33406421	O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is a unique enzyme introducing O-GlcNAc moiety on target proteins, and it critically regulates various cellular processes in diverse cell types. However, its roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain elusive. Here, using Ogt conditional knockout mice, we show that OGT is essential for HSPCs. Ogt is highly expressed in HSPCs, and its disruption induces rapid loss of HSPCs with increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. In particular, Ogt-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose quiescence, cannot be maintained in vivo, and become vulnerable to regenerative and competitive stress. Interestingly, Ogt-deficient HSCs accumulate defective mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy with decreased key mitophagy regulator, Pink1, through dysregulation of H3K4me3. Furthermore, overexpression of PINK1 restores mitophagy and the number of Ogt-deficient HSCs. Collectively, our results reveal that OGT critically regulates maintenance and stress response of HSCs by ensuring mitochondrial quality through PINK1-dependent mitophagy.

33440148	Recent studies have profiled the innate immune signatures in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and suggest that cellular responses to viral challenge may affect disease severity. Yet the molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-kappaB/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.

33472080	The JAK/STAT1 pathway is generally activated by cytokines, providing essential antiviral defense. Here, we identify that STAT1 activation is independent of cytokines and JAKs at the early infection stage of some viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Instead, STAT1 is activated mainly through spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) downstream of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I/mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (RIG-I/MAVS) signaling. Syk deletion profoundly impairs immediate innate immunity, as evidenced by the finding that Syk deletion attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and reduces the expressions of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral response to IAV infection is also significantly suppressed in the STAT1(Y701F) knockin mice. The results demonstrate that STAT1 activation is dependent on Syk rather than the cytokine-activated JAK signaling at the early stage of viral infection, which is critical for initial antiviral immunity. Our finding provides insights into the complicated mechanisms underlying host immune responses to viral infection.	Critical role of Syk-dependent STAT1 activation in innate antiviral immunity.

33472079	Mitochondria not only serve as a platform for innate immune signaling transduction but also enhance immune responses by releasing mitochondrial DNA and RNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether mitochondrial matrix proteins could be liberated and involved in immune responses remains enigmatic. Here, we identify the mitochondrial protein ERA G-protein-like 1 (ERAL1) as a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-interacting protein by using proximity-based labeling technology. ERAL1 deficiency markedly reduces the downstream antiviral signaling triggered by RNA viruses. Moreover, ERAL1-deficient mice are more susceptible to lethality following RNA virus infection than wild-type mice. After virus infection, ERAL1 is released from mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore. The cytosolic ERAL1 facilitates lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of retinoicacid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and promotes downstream MAVS polymerization, thus positively regulating antiviral responses.	The mitochondrial protein ERAL1 suppresses RNA virus infection by facilitating RIG-I-like receptor signaling.	Cell reports
33472082	The endolysosomal system fulfills a wide variety of cellular functions, many of which are modulated through interactions with other organelles. In particular, the ER exerts spatiotemporal constraints on the organization and motility of endosomes and lysosomes. We have recently described the ER transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF26 as a regulator of endolysosomal perinuclear positioning and transport dynamics. Here, we report that the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2J1, also anchored in the ER membrane, partners with RNF26 in this context, and that the cellular activity of the resulting E2/E3 pair is localized in a perinuclear ER subdomain and supported by transmembrane interactions. Through modification of SQSTM1/p62 on lysine 435, the ER-embedded UBE2J1/RNF26 ubiquitylation complex recruits endosomal adaptors to immobilize their cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region of the cell. The resulting spatiotemporal compartmentalization promotes the trafficking of activated EGFR to lysosomes and facilitates the termination of EGF-induced AKT signaling.

33503422	DNA replication is challenged by numerous exogenous and endogenous factors that can interfere with the progression of replication forks. Substantial accumulation of single-stranded DNA during DNA replication activates the DNA replication stress checkpoint response that slows progression from S/G2 to M phase to protect genomic integrity. Whether and how mild replication stress restricts proliferation remains controversial. Here, we identify a cell cycle exit mechanism that prevents S/G2 phase arrested cells from undergoing mitosis after exposure to mild replication stress through premature activation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C(CDH1)). We find that replication stress causes a gradual decrease of the levels of the APC/C(CDH1) inhibitor EMI1/FBXO5 through Forkhead box O (FOXO)-mediated inhibition of its transcription factor E2F1. By doing so, FOXOs limit the time during which the replication stress checkpoint is reversible and thereby play an important role in maintaining genomic stability.

33503437	"Muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a quiescent (non-proliferative) stem cell population in uninjured skeletal muscle. Although SCs have been investigated for nearly 60 years, the molecular drivers that transform quiescent SCs into the rapidly dividing (activated) stem/progenitor cells that mediate muscle repair after injury remain largely unknown. Here we identify a prominent FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) mRNA and protein signature in recently activated SCs that is rapidly, heterogeneously, and transiently induced by muscle damage. We further reveal a requirement for FOS to efficiently initiate key stem cell functions, including cell cycle entry, proliferative expansion, and muscle regeneration, via induction of ""pro-regenerative"" target genes that stimulate cell migration, division, and differentiation. Disruption of one of these Fos/AP-1 targets, NAD(+)-consuming mono-ADP-ribosyl-transferase 1 (Art1), in SCs delays cell cycle entry and impedes progenitor cell expansion and muscle regeneration.

33503415	The cell-cycle phase is a major determinant of repair pathway choice at DNA double strand breaks, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or homologous recombination (HR). Chk1 responds to genotoxic stress in S/G2 phase, but here, we report a role of Chk1 in directly promoting NHEJ repair in G1 phase. ASF1A is a histone chaperone, but it promotes NHEJ through a pathway independent of its histone-chaperone activity. Chk1 activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase on DNA breaks in G1 promotes NHEJ through direct phosphorylation of ASF1A at Ser-166. ASF1A phosphorylated at Ser-166 interacts with the repair protein MDC1 and thus enhances MDC1's interaction with ATM and the stable localization of ATM at DNA breaks. Chk1 deficiency suppresses all steps downstream of MDC1 following a DNA break in G1, namely histone ubiquitination, 53BP1 localization to the DNA break, and NHEJ. Thus, ASF1A phosphorylation by Chk1 is essential for DNA break repair by NHEJ in G1.	Chk1 promotes non-homologous end joining in G1 through direct phosphorylation of ASF1A.	Cell reports
33535045	The signal adaptor MyD88, an essential component of TLR signaling, plays an important role in gut-microbiome interactions. However, its contribution to colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is still controversial. Far less is known about the specific effects of MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts in CAC development. Here, we used a CAC mouse model in which MyD88 was selectively depleted in myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast MyD88-deficient mice are resistant to azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced tumorigenesis, as evidenced by the decrease in the number and sizes of tumors. MyD88 deficiency in myofibroblasts attenuates intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation after acute DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts increases the secretion of osteopontin (OPN), which promotes macrophage M2 polarization through binding to alphavbeta3 and CD44, leading to activation of the STAT3/PPARgamma pathway. Thus, MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts crucially contributes to colorectal cancer development and provides a promising therapeutic target for the prevention of colitis-associated carcinogenesis.

33567272	Bacterial pneumonia is a global healthcare burden, and unwarranted inflammation is suggested as an important cause of mortality. Optimum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are essential to reduce inflammation and improve survival in pneumonia. Elevated levels of the mitochondrial-DAMP cardiolipin (CL), reported in tracheal aspirates of pneumonia patients, have been shown to block IL-10 production from lung MDSCs. Although CL-mediated K107 SUMOylation of PPARgamma has been suggested to impair this IL-10 production, the mechanism remains elusive. We identify PIAS2 to be the specific E3-SUMOligase responsible for this SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify a concomitant CL-mediated PPARgamma S112 phosphorylation, mediated by JNK-MAPK, to be essential for PIAS2 recruitment. Furthermore, using a clinically tested peptide inhibitor targeting JNK-MAPK, we blocked these post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PPARgamma and rescued IL-10 expression, improving survival in murine pneumonia models. Thus, we explore the mechanism of mito-DAMP-mediated impaired lung inflammation resolution and propose a therapeutic strategy targeting PPARgamma PTMs.	Cardiolipin-mediated PPARgamma S112 phosphorylation impairs IL-10 production and inflammation resolution during bacterial pneumonia.

33567255	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global health threat caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Emerging evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dysregulated immune response and a delayed interferon (IFN) expression in patients, which contribute largely to the viral pathogenesis and development of COVID-19. However, underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the activation and repression of the innate immune response by SARS-CoV-2. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RNA activates the RIG-I-MAVS-dependent IFN signaling pathway. We further uncover that ORF9b immediately accumulates and antagonizes the antiviral type I IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection on primary human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. ORF9b targets the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) essential modulator NEMO and interrupts its K63-linked polyubiquitination upon viral stimulation, thereby inhibiting the canonical IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha)/beta/gamma-NF-kappaB signaling and subsequent IFN production. Our findings thus unveil the innate immunosuppression by ORF9b and provide insights into the host-virus interplay during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

33596425	The intestine is under constant exposure to chemicals, antigens, and microorganisms from the external environment. Apical aspects of transporting epithelial cells (enterocytes) form a brush-border membrane (BBM), shaped by packed microvilli coated with a dense glycocalyx. We present evidence showing that the glycocalyx forms an epithelial barrier that prevents exogenous molecules and live bacteria from gaining access to BBM. We use a multi-omics approach to investigate the function and regulation of membrane mucins exposed on the BBM during postnatal development of the mouse small intestine. Muc17 is identified as a major membrane mucin in the glycocalyx that is specifically upregulated by IL-22 as part of an epithelial defense repertoire during weaning. High levels of IL-22 at time of weaning reprogram neonatal postmitotic progenitor enterocytes to differentiate into Muc17-expressing enterocytes, as found in the adult intestine during homeostasis. Our findings propose a role for Muc17 in epithelial barrier function in the small intestine.	IL-22 promotes the formation of a MUC17 glycocalyx barrier in the postnatal small intestine during weaning.	Cell reports
33596423	SOX17 has been implicated in arterial specification and the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the murine embryo. However, knowledge about molecular pathways and stage-specific effects of SOX17 in humans remains limited. Here, using SOX17-knockout and SOX17-inducible human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), paired with molecular profiling studies, we reveal that SOX17 is a master regulator of HOXA and arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium (HE) and is required for the specification of HE with robust lympho-myeloid potential and DLL4(+)CXCR4(+) phenotype resembling arterial HE at the sites of HSC emergence. Along with the activation of NOTCH signaling, SOX17 directly activates CDX2 expression, leading to the upregulation of the HOXA cluster genes. Since deficiencies in HOXA and NOTCH signaling contribute to the impaired in vivo engraftment of hPSC-derived hematopoietic cells, the identification of SOX17 as a key regulator linking arterial and HOXA programs in HE may help to program HSC fate from hPSCs.	SOX17 integrates HOXA and arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium to drive definitive lympho-myeloid hematopoiesis.	Cell reports
33596420	Aberrant expression of nuclear transporters and deregulated subcellular localization of their cargo proteins are emerging as drivers and therapeutic targets of cancer. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear exporter exportin-6 and its cargo profilin-1 constitute a functionally important and frequently deregulated axis in cancer. Exportin-6 upregulation occurs in numerous cancer types and is associated with poor patient survival. Reducing exportin-6 level in breast cancer cells triggers antitumor effects by accumulating nuclear profilin-1. Mechanistically, nuclear profilin-1 interacts with eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL) within the super elongation complex (SEC) and inhibits the ability of the SEC to drive transcription of numerous pro-cancer genes including MYC. XPO6 and MYC are positively correlated across diverse cancer types including breast cancer. Therapeutically, exportin-6 loss sensitizes breast cancer cells to the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1. Thus, exportin-6 upregulation is a previously unrecognized cancer driver event by spatially inhibiting nuclear profilin-1 as a tumor suppressor.	Cancer-associated exportin-6 upregulation inhibits the transcriptionally repressive and anticancer effects of nuclear profilin-1.	Cell reports
33596426	Mossy cells (MCs) are a unique group of excitatory neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region important for emotion, learning, and memory. Due to the lack of a reliable method to isolate MCs from other cell types, how MCs integrate neural information and convey it to their synaptic targets for engaging a specific function are still unknown. Here, we report that MCs control the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by synapsing directly onto local somatostatin-expressing (SST) cells. MC-SST synaptic transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP), requiring Gria2-lacking Ca(2+)-permeable anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (Ca(2+)AR). A long noncoding RNA (Gria2I) is associated with Gria2 transcriptional repressors in SST cells. Silencing Gria2I induces Gria2 transcription, blocks LTP of MCs-SST synaptic transmission, and reduces the efficacy of memory retrieval. Thus, MCs directly and functionally innervate local SST neurons, and this innervation controls the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by Gria2I inhibition of Gria2 transcription.	A circuit of mossy cells controls the efficacy of memory retrieval by Gria2I inhibition of Gria2.	Cell reports
33626359	Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) drives tumor development in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer. The transcription factor GATA3 has been closely linked to ER function, but its precise role in this setting remains unclear. Quantitative proteomics was used to assess changes to the ER complex in response to GATA3 depletion. Unexpectedly, few proteins were lost from the ER complex in the absence of GATA3, with the only major change being depletion of the dioxygenase TET2. TET2 binding constituted a near-total subset of ER binding in multiple breast cancer models, with loss of TET2 associated with reduced activation of proliferative pathways. TET2 knockdown did not appear to change global methylated cytosine (5mC) levels; however, oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was significantly reduced, and these events occurred at ER enhancers. These findings implicate TET2 in the maintenance of 5hmC at ER sites, providing a potential mechanism for TET2-mediated regulation of ER target genes.	TET2 is a component of the estrogen receptor complex and controls 5mC to 5hmC conversion at estrogen receptor cis-regulatory regions.	Cell reports
33626345	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. One major obstacle to treatment is a lack of effective molecular-targeted therapies. In this study, we find that EphA2 expression and signaling are enriched in human HCC and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of EphA2 suppresses the initiation and growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated EphA2 inhibition significantly delays tumor development in a genetically engineered murine model of HCC. Mechanistically, we discover that targeting EphA2 suppresses both AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling, two separate oncogenic pathways in HCC. We also identify a small molecule kinase inhibitor of EphA2 that suppresses tumor progression in a murine HCC model. Together, our results suggest EphA2 as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.	Targeting EphA2 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and progression by dual inhibition of JAK1/STAT3 and AKT signaling.	Cell reports
33657371	Muscle differentiation is a multifaceted and tightly controlled process required for the formation of skeletal muscle fibers. Satellite cells are the direct cellular contributors to muscle repair in injuries or disorders. Here, we show that autotaxin (Atx) expression and activity is required for satellite cell differentiation. Conditional ablation of Atx or its pharmacological inhibition impairs muscle repair. Mechanistically, we identify LPAR1 as the key receptor in Atx-LPA signaling. Myogenic gene array and pathway analysis identified that Atx-LPA signaling activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), an mTOR-dependent master regulator of muscle cell growth via LPAR1. Furthermore, Atx transgenic mice show muscle hypertrophic effects and accelerated regeneration. Intramuscular injections of Atx/LPA show muscle hypertrophy. In addition, the regulatory effects of Atx on differentiation are conserved in human myoblasts. This study identifies Atx as a critical master regulator in murine and human muscles, identifying a promising extracellular ligand in muscle formation, regeneration, and hypertrophy.	Atx regulates skeletal muscle regeneration via LPAR1 and promotes hypertrophy.	Cell reports
33657363	Type I interferons (IFNs) induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to viral infection. Induction of these ISGs must be regulated for an efficient and controlled antiviral response, but post-transcriptional controls of these genes have not been well defined. Here, we identify a role for the RNA base modification N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in the regulation of ISGs. Using ribosome profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, coupled with m(6)A-immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we identify a subset of ISGs, including IFITM1, whose translation is enhanced by m(6)A and the m(6)A methyltransferase proteins METTL3 and METTL14. We further determine that the m(6)A reader YTHDF1 increases the expression of IFITM1 in an m(6)A-binding-dependent manner. Importantly, we find that the m(6)A methyltransferase complex promotes the antiviral activity of type I IFN. Thus, these studies identify m(6)A as having a role in post-transcriptional control of ISG translation during the type I IFN response for antiviral restriction.

33657382	Cancer cells use actin-based membrane protrusions, invadopodia, to degrade stroma and invade. In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), the endothelin A receptor (ETAR) drives invadopodia by a not fully explored coordinated function of beta-arrestin1 (beta-arr1). Here, we report that beta-arr1 links the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/betaPIX complex to activate Rac3 GTPase, acting as a central node in the adhesion-based extracellular matrix (ECM) sensing and degradation. Downstream, Rac3 phosphorylates PAK1 and cofilin and promotes invadopodium-dependent ECM proteolysis and invasion. Furthermore, ETAR/ILK/Rac3 signaling supports the communication between cancer and mesothelial cells, favoring SOC cell adhesion and transmigration. In vivo, ambrisentan, an ETAR antagonist, inhibits the adhesion and spreading of tumor cells to intraperitoneal organs, and invadopodium marker expression. As prognostic factors, high EDNRA/ILK expression correlates with poor SOC clinical outcome. These findings provide a framework for the ET-1R/beta-arr1 pathway as an integrator of ILK/Rac3-dependent adhesive and proteolytic signaling to invadopodia, favoring cancer/stroma interactions and metastatic behavior.	Endothelin-1 drives invadopodia and interaction with mesothelial cells through ILK.	Cell reports
33691099	Calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria is a critical contributor to apoptosis. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ovarian killer (BOK) localizes to the ER and binds the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosophate receptor (IP3R). Here, we show that BOK is necessary for baseline mitochondrial calcium levels and stimulus-induced calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BOK have decreased proximity of the ER to the mitochondria and altered protein composition of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which form essential calcium microdomains. Rescue of the ER-mitochondrial juxtaposition with drug-inducible interorganelle linkers reveals a kinetic disruption, which when overcome in Bok(-/-) cells is still insufficient to rescue thapsigargin-induced calcium transfer and apoptosis. Likewise, a BOK mutant unable to interact with IP3R restores ER-mitochondrial proximity, but not ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer, MAM protein composition, or apoptosis. This work identifies the dynamic coordination of ER-mitochondrial contact by BOK as an important control point for apoptosis.	BOK controls apoptosis by Ca(2+) transfer through ER-mitochondrial contact sites.	Cell reports
33730592	Loss of integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins can trigger a variety of cellular changes that affect cell viability. Foremost among these is the activation of anoikis, caspase-mediated cell death induced by ECM detachment. In addition, loss of ECM attachment causes profound alterations in cellular metabolism, which can lead to anoikis-independent cell death. Here, we describe a surprising role for serum and glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1) in the promotion of energy production when cells are detached. Our data demonstrate that SGK1 activation is necessary and sufficient for ATP generation during ECM detachment and anchorage-independent growth. More specifically, SGK1 promotes a substantial elevation in glucose uptake because of elevated GLUT1 transcription. In addition, carbon flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is necessary to accommodate elevated glucose uptake and PPP-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is necessary for ATP production. Thus, our data show SGK1 as master regulator of glucose metabolism and cell survival during ECM-detached conditions.	SGK1 signaling promotes glucose metabolism and survival in extracellular matrix detached cells.	Cell reports
33730578	Rab1A is a small GTPase known for its role in vesicular trafficking. Recent evidence indicates that Rab1A is essential for amino acids (aas) sensing and signaling to regulate mTORC1 in normal and cancer cells. However, Rab1A's in vivo function in mammals is not known. Here, we report the generation of tamoxifen (TAM)-induced whole body Rab1A knockout (Rab1A(-/-)) in adult mice. Rab1A(-/-) mice are viable but become hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant due to impaired insulin transcription and beta-cell proliferation and maintenance. Mechanistically, Rab1A mediates AA-mTORC1 signaling, particularly branched chain amino acids (BCAA), to regulate the stability and localization of the insulin transcription factor Pdx1. Collectively, these results reveal a physiological role of aa-Rab1A-mTORC1 signaling in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis in mammals. Intriguingly, Rab1A expression is reduced in beta-cells of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, which is correlated with loss of insulin expression, suggesting that Rab1A downregulation contributes to T2D progression.	Amino acids-Rab1A-mTORC1 signaling controls whole-body glucose homeostasis.	Cell reports
33730589	Senescent cells trigger their own immune-mediated destruction, termed senescence surveillance. This is dependent on the inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes COX2, an enzyme with complex roles in cancer. The role COX2 plays during senescence surveillance is unknown. Here, we show that during RAS-induced senescence (RIS), COX2 is a critical regulator of SASP composition and senescence surveillance in vivo. COX2 regulates the expression of multiple inflammatory SASP components through an autocrine feedback loop involving its downstream product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), binding to EP4. During in vivo hepatocyte RIS, Cox2 is critical to tumor suppression, Cxcl1 expression, and immune-mediated senescence surveillance, partially through PGE2. Loss of Cox2 in RIS dysregulates the intrahepatic immune microenvironment, with enrichment of immunosuppressive immature myeloid cells and CD4(+) regulatory T lymphocytes. Therefore, COX2 and PGE2 play a critical role in senescence, shaping SASP composition, promoting senescence surveillance and tumor suppression in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis.	COX2 regulates senescence secretome composition and senescence surveillance through PGE2.	Cell reports
33730584	Although many of the factors, epigenetic changes, and cell cycle stages that distinguish repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) from non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are known, the underlying mechanisms that determine pathway choice are incompletely understood. Previously, we found that the transcription factor Sp1 is recruited to DSBs and is necessary for repair. Here, we demonstrate that Sp1 localizes to DSBs in G1 and is necessary for recruitment of the NHEJ repair factor, 53BP1. Phosphorylation of Sp1-S59 in early S phase evicts Sp1 and 53BP1 from the break site; inhibition of that phosphorylation results in 53BP1 and Sp1 remaining at DSBs in S phase cells, precluding BRCA1 binding and suppressing HR. Expression of Sp1-S59A increases sensitivity of BRCA1(+/+) cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition similar to BRCA1 deficiency. These data demonstrate how Sp1 integrates the cell cycle and DSB repair pathway choice to favor NHEJ.	DSB repair pathway choice is regulated by recruitment of 53BP1 through cell cycle-dependent regulation of Sp1.	Cell reports
33730565	Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to the RING-between-RING family. Mutations in the Parkin-encoding gene PARK2 are associated with familial Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigate the interplay between Parkin and the inflammatory cytokine-induced ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10. FAT10 targets hundreds of proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. We show that FAT10 gets conjugated to Parkin and mediates its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Parkin binds to the E2 enzyme of FAT10 (USE1), auto-FAT10ylates itself, and facilitates FAT10ylation of the Parkin substrate Mitofusin2 in vitro and in cells, thus identifying Parkin as a FAT10 E3 ligase. On mitochondrial depolarization, FAT10ylation of Parkin inhibits its activation and ubiquitin-ligase activity causing impairment of mitophagy progression and aggravation of rotenone-mediated death of dopaminergic neuronal cells. In conclusion, FAT10ylation inhibits Parkin and mitophagy rendering FAT10 a likely inflammation-induced exacerbating factor and potential drug target for Parkinson's disease.	Parkin is an E3 ligase for the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10, which inhibits Parkin activation and mitophagy.	Cell reports
33761359	ATP-competitive inhibitors have been developed as promising anti-cancer agents. However, drug-resistance frequently occurs, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that the activation of c-Src and its downstream phosphorylation cascade can be paradoxically induced by Src-targeted and RTK-targeted kinase inhibitors. We reveal that inhibitor binding induces a conformational change in c-Src, leading to the association of the active form c-Src with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Reduction of the inhibitor concentration results in the dissociation of inhibitors from the c-Src-FAK complex, which allows c-Src to phosphorylate FAK and initiate FAK-Grb2-mediated Erk signaling. Furthermore, a drug-resistant mutation in c-Src, which reduces the affinity of inhibitors for c-Src, converts Src inhibitors into facilitators of cell proliferation by enhancing the phosphorylation of FAK and Erk in c-Src-mutated cells. Our data thus reveal paradoxical enhancement of cell growth evoked by target-based kinase inhibitors, providing potentially important clues for the future development of effective and safe cancer treatment.

33789098	The breast cancer type I susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and BRCA1-associated RING domain protein I (BARD1) heterodimer promote genome integrity through pleiotropic functions, including DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization is required for their mutual stability, HR function, and role in tumor suppression; however, the upstream signaling events governing BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization are unclear. Here, we show that SIRT2, a sirtuin deacetylase and breast tumor suppressor, promotes BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization through deacetylation. SIRT2 complexes with BRCA1-BARD1 and deacetylates conserved lysines in the BARD1 RING domain, interfacing BRCA1, which promotes BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization and consequently BRCA1-BARD1 stability, nuclear retention, and localization to DNA damage sites, thus contributing to efficient HR. Our findings define a mechanism for regulation of BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization through SIRT2 deacetylation, elucidating a critical upstream signaling event directing BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization, which facilitates HR and tumor suppression, and delineating a role for SIRT2 in directing DSB repair by HR.	SIRT2 promotes BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization through deacetylation.	Cell reports
33789117	Flux through the RAF-MEK-ERK protein kinase cascade is shaped by phosphatases acting on the core components of the pathway. Despite being an established drug target and a hub for crosstalk regulation, little is known about dephosphorylation of MEK, the central kinase within the cascade. Here, we identify PPP6C, a phosphatase frequently mutated or downregulated in melanoma, as a major MEK phosphatase in cells exhibiting oncogenic ERK pathway activation. Recruitment of MEK to PPP6C occurs through an interaction with its associated regulatory subunits. Loss of PPP6C causes hyperphosphorylation of MEK at activating and crosstalk phosphorylation sites, promoting signaling through the ERK pathway and decreasing sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Recurrent melanoma-associated PPP6C mutations cause MEK hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that they promote disease at least in part by activating the core oncogenic pathway driving melanoma. Collectively, our studies identify a key negative regulator of ERK signaling that may influence susceptibility to targeted cancer therapies.	PPP6C negatively regulates oncogenic ERK signaling through dephosphorylation of MEK.	Cell reports
33789097	The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex detects and processes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Its DNA binding and processing activities are regulated by transitions between an ATP-bound state and a post-hydrolysis cutting state that is nucleolytically active. Mre11 endonuclease activity is stimulated by Sae2, whose lack increases MRX persistence at DSBs and checkpoint activation. Here we show that the Rif2 protein inhibits Mre11 endonuclease activity and is responsible for the increased MRX retention at DSBs in sae2Delta cells. We identify a Rad50 residue that is important for Rad50-Rif2 interaction and Rif2 inhibition of Mre11 nuclease. This residue is located near a Rad50 surface that binds Sae2 and is important in stabilizing the Mre11-Rad50 (MR) interaction in the cutting state. We propose that Sae2 stimulates Mre11 endonuclease activity by stabilizing a post-hydrolysis MR conformation that is competent for DNA cleavage, whereas Rif2 antagonizes this Sae2 function and stabilizes an endonuclease inactive MR conformation.	Sae2 and Rif2 regulate MRX endonuclease activity at DNA double-strand breaks in opposite manners.	Cell reports
33826889	Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal brain maturation are less understood. Here, we identify the miR-29 family to be strikingly induced during the late stages of brain maturation. Brain maturation is associated with a transient, postnatal period of de novo non-CG (CH) DNA methylation mediated by DNMT3A. We examine whether an important function of miR-29 during brain maturation is to restrict the period of CH methylation via its targeting of Dnmt3a. Deletion of miR-29 in the brain, or knockin mutations preventing miR-29 to specifically target Dnmt3a, result in increased DNMT3A expression, higher CH methylation, and repression of genes associated with neuronal activity and neuropsychiatric disorders. These mouse models also develop neurological deficits and premature lethality. Our results identify an essential role for miR-29 in restricting CH methylation in the brain and illustrate the importance of CH methylation regulation for normal brain maturation.	MicroRNA-29 is an essential regulator of brain maturation through regulation of CH methylation.	Cell reports
33826887	The colon epithelium is a primary point of interaction with the microbiome and is regenerated by a few rapidly cycling colonic stem cells (CSCs). CSC self-renewal and proliferation are regulated by growth factors and the presence of bacteria. However, the molecular link connecting the diverse inputs that maintain CSC homeostasis remains largely unknown. We report that CSC proliferation is mediated by redox-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1). NOX1 expression is CSC specific and is restricted to proliferative CSCs. In the absence of NOX1, CSCs fail to generate ROS and have a reduced proliferation rate. NOX1 expression is regulated by Toll-like receptor activation in response to the microbiota and serves to link CSC proliferation with the presence of bacterial components in the crypt. The TLR-NOX1-EGFR axis is therefore a critical redox signaling node in CSCs facilitating the quiescent-proliferation transition and responds to the microbiome to maintain colon homeostasis.	NOX1-dependent redox signaling potentiates colonic stem cell proliferation to adapt to the intestinal microbiota by linking EGFR and TLR activation.	Cell reports
33852844	The huntingtin (HTT) protein transports various organelles, including vesicles containing neurotrophic factors, from embryonic development throughout life. To better understand how HTT mediates axonal transport and why this function is disrupted in Huntington's disease (HD), we study vesicle-associated HTT and find that it is dimethylated at a highly conserved arginine residue (R118) by the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6). Without R118 methylation, HTT associates less with vesicles, anterograde trafficking is diminished, and neuronal death ensues-very similar to what occurs in HD. Inhibiting PRMT6 in HD cells and neurons exacerbates mutant HTT (mHTT) toxicity and impairs axonal trafficking, whereas overexpressing PRMT6 restores axonal transport and neuronal viability, except in the presence of a methylation-defective variant of mHTT. In HD flies, overexpressing PRMT6 rescues axonal defects and eclosion. Arginine methylation thus regulates HTT-mediated vesicular transport along the axon, and increasing HTT methylation could be of therapeutic interest for HD.	Huntingtin-mediated axonal transport requires arginine methylation by PRMT6.	Cell reports
33910019	Several neurodegenerative diseases present Tau accumulation as the main pathological marker. Tau post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are increased in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that Tau hyper-acetylation at residue 174 increases its own nuclear presence and is the result of DNA damage signaling or the lack of SIRT6, both causative of neurodegeneration. Tau-K174ac is deacetylated in the nucleus by SIRT6. However, lack of SIRT6 or chronic DNA damage results in nuclear Tau-K174ac accumulation. Once there, it induces global changes in gene expression, affecting protein translation, synthesis, and energy production. Concomitantly, Alzheimer's disease (AD) case subjects show increased nucleolin and a decrease in SIRT6 levels. AD case subjects present increased levels of nuclear Tau, particularly Tau-K174ac. Our results suggest that increased Tau-K174ac in AD case subjects is the result of DNA damage signaling and SIRT6 depletion. We propose that Tau-K174ac toxicity is due to its increased stability, nuclear accumulation, and nucleolar dysfunction.	SIRT6-CBP-dependent nuclear Tau accumulation and its role in protein synthesis.

33910006	The primary cilium (PC) regulates signalization linked to external stress sensing. Previous works established a functional interplay between the PC and the autophagic machinery. When ciliogenesis is promoted by serum deprivation, the autophagy protein ATG16L1 and the ciliary protein IFT20 are co-transported to the PC. Here, we demonstrate that IFT20 and ATG16L1 are part of the same complex requiring the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 and a Y-E-F-I motif in IFT20. We show that ATG16L1-deficient cells exhibit aberrant ciliary structures, which accumulate PI4,5P2, whereas PI4P, a lipid normally concentrated in the PC, is absent. Finally, we demonstrate that INPP5E, a phosphoinositide-associated phosphatase responsible for PI4P generation, interacts with ATG16L1 and that a perturbation of the ATG16L1/IFT20 complex alters its trafficking to the PC. Altogether, our results reveal a function of ATG16L1 in ciliary lipid and protein trafficking, thus directly contributing to proper PC dynamics and functions.	The autophagy protein ATG16L1 cooperates with IFT20 and INPP5E to regulate the turnover of phosphoinositides at the primary cilium.	Cell reports
33910002	MYC-driven medulloblastoma is a major therapeutic challenge due to frequent metastasis and a poor 5-year survival rate. MYC gene amplification results in transcriptional dysregulation, proliferation, and survival of malignant cells. To identify therapeutic targets in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, we employ a CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen targeting 1,140 genes. We identify CDK7 as a mediator of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic depletion, we observe cessation of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models and increases in apoptosis. The results are attributed to repression of a core set of MYC-driven transcriptional programs mediating DNA repair. CDK7 inhibition alters RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and MYC association at DNA repair genes. Blocking CDK7 activity sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation leading to accrual of DNA damage, extending survival and tumor latency in xenograft mouse models. Our studies establish the selective inhibition of MYC-driven medulloblastoma by CDK7 inhibition combined with radiation as a viable therapeutic strategy.	Transcriptional control of DNA repair networks by CDK7 regulates sensitivity to radiation in MYC-driven medulloblastoma.	Cell reports
33951433	The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7) is a central regulator that promotes stem growth by activating growth-related gene expression during shade-avoidance responses. Studying the co-factors of PIF7 can facilitate understanding of the mechanism of PIFs and light signal transduction. Here, we describe the identification of two bHLH transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60 (bHLH48/bHLH60), as essential partners for PIF7-dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation and function downstream of phytochrome B. These two bHLH factors display DNA binding activity and interact with PIF7. Genetic analysis indicated that bHLH48/bHLH60 and PIF7 are interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified the substantially overlapping downstream targets of bHLH60 and PIF7. Biochemical analysis revealed that bHLH48/bHLH60 enhance the DNA binding ability of PIF7. These results provide evidence that bHLH48/bHLH60 act as positive partners of PIF7 for mutual benefit in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation.	Two bHLH transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60, associate with phytochrome interacting factor 7 to regulate hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis.	Cell reports
33951440	mTOR, the sensor of nutrients and growth factors, has important roles in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. However, how mTOR controls gastric epithelial cell turnover and gastric cancer development, a leading malignancy, remains poorly understood. Here, we provide genetic evidence that mTOR activation promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation of Lgr5(+) gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs) in gastric homeostasis and tumorigenesis. mTOR signaling increases MEK1 and Smad1 expression and enhances activation of MEK1-ERKs and BMP-Smad1 pathways, respectively, in GEPs and gastric tumors. Mek1 deletion or inhibition rescues hyperproliferation, whereas Bmpr1a ablation or inhibition rescues differentiation defects of Tsc1(-/-) GEPs. Tsc1 deficiency in Lgr5(+) GEPs accelerates gastric tumor initiation and development, which require MEK1-ERKs for hyperplasia and BMP-Smad1 for differentiation suppression. These findings reveal how mTOR signaling controls Lgr5(+) GEP homeostasis and cancerization and suggest that ERKs and Smad1 signaling can be safely targeted to substitute mTOR inhibitors in gastric cancer therapy.	mTOR signaling regulates gastric epithelial progenitor homeostasis and gastric tumorigenesis via MEK1-ERKs and BMP-Smad1 pathways.

33979615	Dicotyledonous plants form an apical hook to protect the fragile apical meristem during upward protrusion from the soil. Etiolated pifq (pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5) seedlings display constitutive apical hook opening. Here, we show that PIF proteins control apical hook opening by regulating the expression of Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazole 3.1 (BUB3.1) and affecting cytokinesis. Consistent with the major function of BUB3.1 in the organization of phragmoplasts during cytokinesis, the phragmoplasts are well formed in dark-grown pifq but not in wild type. DNA staining and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrate that cellular endoreduplication levels are dramatically reduced in pifq. Chemical treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor of phragmoplast-based cytokinesis, shows that cytokinesis is involved in the apical hook opening. Genetically, BUB3.1 is epistatic to PIFq in the regulation of cytokinesis. Our findings reveal an organ-specific role of PIF proteins in regulating cytokinesis by BUB3.1 during apical hook development.	Phytochrome interacting factor proteins regulate cytokinesis in Arabidopsis.	Cell reports
33979607	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control critical aspects of cardiomyocyte function, but the repertoire of active RBPs in cardiomyocytes during the growth response is largely unknown. We define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a system-wide level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67 cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs, including several contractile proteins. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic RBP, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. We identify mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4 in cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4 target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) are discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the expression of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding to specific mRNAs in response to pathological growth stimulation.	Identification of dynamic RNA-binding proteins uncovers a Cpeb4-controlled regulatory cascade during pathological cell growth of cardiomyocytes.	Cell reports
34010654	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder, with impaired brain development caused by mutations in MECP2; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We know from previous work that MeCP2 facilitates the processing of a specific microRNA, miR-199a, by associating with the Drosha complex to regulate neuronal functions. Here, we show that the MeCP2/miR-199a axis regulates neural stem/precursor cell (NS/PC) differentiation. A shift occurs from neuronal to astrocytic differentiation of MeCP2- and miR-199a-deficient NS/PCs due to the upregulation of a miR-199a target, Smad1, a downstream transcription factor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Moreover, miR-199a expression and treatment with BMP inhibitors rectify the differentiation of RTT patient-derived NS/PCs and development of brain organoids, respectively, suggesting that facilitation of BMP signaling accounts for the impaired RTT brain development. Our study illuminates the molecular pathology of RTT and reveals the MeCP2/miR-199a/Smad1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for RTT.	MeCP2 controls neural stem cell fate specification through miR-199a-mediated inhibition of BMP-Smad signaling.	Cell reports
34010649	Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles subjected to fission and fusion events. During mitosis, mitochondrial fission ensures equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells. If and how this process can actively drive mitotic progression remains largely unknown. Here, we discover a pathway linking mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main mitochondrial receptor for the Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is directly phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D (PKD) specifically during mitosis. PKD-dependent MFF phosphorylation is required and sufficient for mitochondrial fission in mitotic but not in interphasic cells. Phosphorylation of MFF is crucial for chromosome segregation and promotes cell survival by inhibiting adaptation of the mitotic checkpoint. Thus, PKD/MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.	A PKD-MFF signaling axis couples mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression.

34038728	Increased vascular permeability and leakage are hallmarks of several pathologies and determine disease progression and severity by facilitating inflammatory/metastatic cell infiltration. Using tissue-specific genetic ablation in endothelial cells, we have investigated in vivo the role of Tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) member with pleiotropic effects in inflammation and cancer. In response to proinflammatory stimuli, endothelial Tpl2 deletion alters tight junction claudin-5 protein expression through inhibition of JNK signaling and lysosomal degradation activation, resulting in reduced vascular permeability and immune cell infiltration. This results in significantly attenuated disease scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fewer tumor nodules in a hematogenic lung cancer metastasis model. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of Tpl2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Tpl2 knockdown recapitulates our findings and reduces lung metastatic tumor invasions. These results establish an endothelial-specific role for Tpl2 and highlight the therapeutic potential of blocking the endothelial-specific Tpl2 pathway in chronic inflammatory and metastatic diseases.	Endothelial Tpl2 regulates vascular barrier function via JNK-mediated degradation of claudin-5 promoting neuroinflammation or tumor metastasis.	Cell reports
34038729	Autophagy dysregulation is implicated in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanism by which the autophagy machinery regulates metabolism is largely unknown. Autophagy is generally considered a degradation process via lysosomes. Here, we unveil a metabolically important non-cell-autonomous, non-degradative mechanism regulated by the essential autophagy protein Becn1 in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet challenge, autophagy-hyperactive Becn1(F121A) mice show systemically improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of energy homeostasis, via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism mediated by adiponectin, an adipose-derived metabolic hormone. Adipose-specific Becn1(F121A) expression is sufficient to activate AMPK in non-adipose tissues and improve systemic insulin sensitivity by increasing adiponectin secretion. Further, Becn1 enhances adiponectin secretion by interacting with components of the exocyst complex via the coiled-coil domain. Together, our study demonstrates that Becn1 improves insulin sensitivity by facilitating adiponectin secretion through binding the exocyst in adipose tissue.	The autophagy protein Becn1 improves insulin sensitivity by promoting adiponectin secretion via exocyst binding.	Cell reports
34038725	Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) regulate the occurrence of obesity and its related diseases. Here, we found that serine/threonine protein kinase 24 (Stk24) expression is downregulated significantly in ATMs in obese subjects or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We further identified that glucolipotoxicity downregulated Stk24 expression in ATMs. Stk24-deficient mice develop severe HFD-induced metabolic disorders and insulin insensitivity. Mechanistically, Stk24 intervenes in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in ATMs by associating directly with NLRP3, decreasing interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secretion. Accordingly, Stk24 deficiency in the hematopoietic system promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which contributes to exacerbation of metabolic disorders. Intriguingly, Stk24 expression correlates negatively with body mass index (BMI) and the levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein in human subjects. These findings provide insights into the function and clinical implications of Stk24 in obesity-mediated metabolic disorders.	Stk24 protects against obesity-associated metabolic disorders by disrupting the NLRP3 inflammasome.	Cell reports
34038731	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. We show here that the protein NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) has a key role in the pathogenesis of mouse and human T1D. More specifically, downregulation of NLRP1 expression occurs during T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation, alongside greater expression of several molecules related to Th17 cell differentiation in a signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway. These changes lead to a consequent increase in interleukin 17 (IL-17) production within the pancreas and higher incidence of diabetes in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice. Finally, in patients with T1D and a SNP (rs12150220) in NLRP1, there is a robust decrease in IL-17 levels in serum and in memory Th17 cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results demonstrate that NLRP1 acts as a negative regulator of the Th17 cell polarization program, making it an interesting target for intervention during the early stages of T1D.	NLRP1 acts as a negative regulator of Th17 cell programming in mice and humans with autoimmune diabetes.	Cell reports
34038737	Cancer immunotherapy focuses on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Unlike RAS-mutated lung cancers, EGFR mutant tumors have a generally low response to immunotherapy. Because treatment outcomes vary by EGFR allele, intrinsic and microenvironmental factors may be involved. Among all non-immunological signaling pathways surveyed in patients' datasets, EGFR signaling is best associated with high PD-L1. Correspondingly, active EGFRs stabilize PD-L1 transcripts and depletion of PD-L1 severely inhibits EGFR-driven tumorigenicity and metastasis in mice. The underlying mechanisms involve the recruitment of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) to a cytoplasmic motif of PD-L1, which enhances PLC-gamma1 activation by EGFR. Once stimulated, PLC-gamma1 activates calcium flux, Rho GTPases, and protein kinase C, collectively promoting an aggressive phenotype. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies can inhibit these intrinsic functions of PD-L1. Our results portray PD-L1 as a molecular amplifier of EGFR signaling and improve the understanding of the resistance of EGFR(+) tumors to immunotherapy.	PD-L1 recruits phospholipase C and enhances tumorigenicity of lung tumors harboring mutant forms of EGFR.	Cell reports
34107258	Maintaining a suitable level of sensitivity to environmental cues is crucial for proper function of adult stem cells. Here, we explore how the intrinsic sensitivity of skin hair follicle (HF) progenitors to growth stimuli is dynamically regulated. We discover miR-24 is an miRNA whose expression in HF progenitors inversely correlates with their growth potency in vivo. We show that its upregulation in adult skin epithelium leads to blunted responses of HF progenitors to growth cues and retards hair regeneration, while its conditional ablation leads to hyper-sensitized growth responsiveness of HF progenitors and precocious hair regeneration. Mechanistically, we find that miR-24 limits the intrinsic growth competence of HF progenitor by directly targeting Plk3, whose downregulation leads to reduced expression of CCNE1, a key cyclin for cell-cycle entry. These findings reveal an miRNA-mediated dynamic and cell-intrinsic mechanism used by HF progenitors to adapt their regenerative competence for different physiological conditions.	miR-24 controls the regenerative competence of hair follicle progenitors by targeting Plk3.

34133934	Succinate functions both as a classical TCA cycle metabolite and an extracellular metabolic stress signal sensed by the mainly Gi-coupled succinate receptor SUCNR1. In the present study, we characterize and compare effects and signaling pathways activated by succinate and both classes of non-metabolite SUCNR1 agonists. By use of specific receptor and pathway inhibitors, rescue in G-protein-depleted cells and monitoring of receptor G protein activation by BRET, we identify Gq rather than Gi signaling to be responsible for SUCNR1-mediated effects on basic transcriptional regulation. Importantly, in primary human M2 macrophages, in which SUCNR1 is highly expressed, we demonstrate that physiological concentrations of extracellular succinate act through SUCNR1-activated Gq signaling to efficiently regulate transcription of immune function genes in a manner that hyperpolarizes their M2 versus M1 phenotype. Thus, sensing of stress-induced extracellular succinate by SUCNR1 is an important transcriptional regulator in human M2 macrophages through Gq signaling.	Extracellular succinate hyperpolarizes M2 macrophages through SUCNR1/GPR91-mediated Gq signaling.	Cell reports
34133930	MYC activates different metabolic programs in a cell-type- and cell-status-dependent manner. However, the role of MYC in inflammatory macrophages has not yet been determined. Metabolic and molecular analyses reveal that MYC, but not hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), is involved in enhancing early glycolytic flux during inflammatory macrophage polarization. Ablation of MYC decreases lactate production by regulating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and causes increased inflammatory cytokines by regulating interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in response to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, myeloid-specific deletion of MYC and pharmacological inhibition of the MYC/LDH axis enhance inflammation and the bacterial clearance in vivo. These results elucidate the potential role of the MYC/LDH/IRF4 axis in inflammatory macrophages by connecting early glycolysis with inflammatory responses and suggest that modulating early glycolytic flux mediated by the MYC/LDH axis can be used to open avenues for the therapeutic modulation of macrophage polarization to fight against bacterial infection.	MYC-mediated early glycolysis negatively regulates proinflammatory responses by controlling IRF4 in inflammatory macrophages.	Cell reports
34161765	Obesity has become a global pandemic. Identification of key factors in adipogenesis helps to tackle obesity and related metabolic diseases. Here, we show that DDB1 binds the histone reader BRWD3 to promote adipogenesis and diet-induced obesity. Although typically recognized as a component of the CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, DDB1 stimulates adipogenesis independently of CUL4. A DDB1 mutant that does not bind CUL4A or CUL4B fully restores adipogenesis in DDB1-deficient cells. Ddb1(+/-) mice show delayed postnatal development of white adipose tissues and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, by interacting with BRWD3, DDB1 is recruited to acetylated histones in the proximal promoters of ELK1 downstream immediate early response genes and facilitates the release of paused RNA polymerase II, thereby activating the transcriptional cascade in adipogenesis. Our findings have uncovered a CUL4-independent function of DDB1 in promoting the transcriptional cascade of adipogenesis, development of adipose tissues, and onset of obesity.	DDB1 binds histone reader BRWD3 to activate the transcriptional cascade in adipogenesis and promote onset of obesity.	Cell reports
34161760	Developing neurons initially form excessive neurites and then remodel them based on molecular cues and neuronal activity. Developing mitral cells in the olfactory bulb initially extend multiple primary dendrites. They then stabilize single primary dendrites while eliminating others. However, the mechanisms underlying selective dendrite remodeling remain elusive. Using CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout screening combined with in utero electroporation, we identify BMPR-2 as a key regulator for selective dendrite stabilization. Bmpr2 knockout and its rescue experiments show that BMPR-2 inhibits LIMK without ligands and thereby permits dendrite destabilization. In contrast, the overexpression of antagonists and agonists indicates that ligand-bound BMPR-2 stabilizes dendrites, most likely by releasing LIMK. Using genetic and FRET imaging experiments, we demonstrate that free LIMK is activated by NMDARs via Rac1, facilitating dendrite stabilization through F-actin formation. Thus, the selective stabilization of primary dendrites is ensured by concomitant inputs of BMP ligands and neuronal activity.	BMPR-2 gates activity-dependent stabilization of primary dendrites during mitral cell remodeling.	Cell reports
34161773	The type I interferon (IFN) pathway is a key component of innate immune response upon invasion of foreign pathogens. It is also under precise control to prevent excessive upregulation and undesired inflammation cascade. In the present study, we report that Riok3, an atypical kinase, negatively regulates retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) sensing-induced type I IFN signaling. Riok3 deficiency selectively inhibits RNA viral replication in vitro, resulting from an upregulated type I IFN pathway. Mice with myeloid-specific Riok3 knockout also show a more robust induction of type I IFN upon RNA virus infection and are more resistant to RNA virus-induced pathogenesis. Mechanistically, Riok3 recruits and interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM40, leading to the degradation of RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) via K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination. Collectively, our data reveal the mechanism that Riok3 employs to be a negative regulator of antiviral innate immunity.	Riok3 inhibits the antiviral immune response by facilitating TRIM40-mediated RIG-I and MDA5 degradation.	Cell reports
34161762	RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-beta), type III IFN (IFN-lambda3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-beta, IFN-lambda3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal inflammation.	DHX15 is required to control RNA virus-induced intestinal inflammation.	Cell reports
34192545	53BP1 is recruited to chromatin in the vicinity of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We identify the nuclear kinesin, KIF18B, as a 53BP1-interacting protein and define its role in 53BP1-mediated DSB repair. KIF18B is a molecular motor protein involved in destabilizing astral microtubules during mitosis. It is primarily nuclear throughout the interphase and is constitutively chromatin bound. Our observations indicate a nuclear function during the interphase for a kinesin previously implicated in mitosis. We identify a central motif in KIF18B, which we term the Tudor-interacting motif (TIM), because of its interaction with the Tudor domain of 53BP1. TIM enhances the interaction between the 53BP1 Tudor domain and dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4. TIM and the motor function of KIF18B are both required for efficient 53BP1 focal recruitment in response to damage and for fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. Our data suggest a role for KIF18B in efficient 53BP1-mediated end-joining of DSBs.	The nuclear kinesin KIF18B promotes 53BP1-mediated DNA double-strand break repair.	Cell reports
34192547	The contribution of adipose-derived FGF21 to energy homeostasis is unclear. Here we show that browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) by beta-adrenergic agonists requires autocrine FGF21 signaling. Adipose-specific deletion of the FGF21 co-receptor beta-Klotho renders mice unresponsive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, mice with liver-specific ablation of FGF21, which eliminates circulating FGF21, remain sensitive to beta-adrenergic browning of iWAT. Concordantly, transgenic overexpression of FGF21 in adipocytes promotes browning in a beta-Klotho-dependent manner without increasing circulating FGF21. Mechanistically, we show that beta-adrenergic stimulation of thermogenic gene expression requires FGF21 in adipocytes to promote phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma and mobilization of intracellular calcium. Moreover, we find that the beta-adrenergic-dependent increase in circulating FGF21 occurs through an indirect mechanism in which fatty acids released by adipocyte lipolysis subsequently activate hepatic PPARalpha to increase FGF21 expression. These studies identify FGF21 as a cell-autonomous autocrine regulator of adipose tissue function.	FGF21 promotes thermogenic gene expression as an autocrine factor in adipocytes.	Cell reports
34192548	To identify therapeutic targets for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, we conduct a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen and determine that suppression of BCAR1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK inhibition. Integrative analysis of genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens also identify BCAR1 as a top synthetic lethal interactor with mutant KRAS. BCAR1 encodes the SRC substrate p130Cas. We determine that SRC-inhibitor-mediated suppression of p130Cas phosphorylation impairs MYC transcription through a DOCK1-RAC1-beta-catenin-dependent mechanism. Additionally, genetic suppression of TUBB3, encoding the betaIII-tubulin subunit of microtubules, or pharmacological inhibition of microtubule function decreases levels of MYC protein in a calpain-dependent manner and potently sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK inhibition. Accordingly, the combination of a dual SRC/tubulin inhibitor with an ERK inhibitor cooperates to reduce MYC protein and synergistically suppress the growth of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer. Thus, we demonstrate that mechanistically diverse combinations with ERK inhibition suppress MYC to impair pancreatic cancer proliferation.	Targeting p130Cas- and microtubule-dependent MYC regulation sensitizes pancreatic cancer to ERK MAPK inhibition.	Cell reports
34233198	The low level of transcytosis is a unique feature of cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs), ensuring restrictive blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (MFSD2A) is a key regulator of the BBB function by suppressing caveolae-mediated transcytosis. However, the mechanisms regulating MFSD2A at the BBB have been barely explored. Here, we show that cerebrovascular EC-specific deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) results in a dramatic increase in vesicular transcytosis by the reduction of MFSD2A, leading to increased transcellular permeability of the BBB. Mechanistically, AKT signaling inhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2-mediated MFSD2A degradation. Consistently, cerebrovascular Nedd4-2 overexpression decreases MFSD2A levels, increases transcytosis, and impairs BBB permeability, recapitulating the phenotypes of Pten-deficient mice. Furthermore, Akt deletion decreases phosphorylated NEDD4-2 levels, restores MFSD2A levels, and normalizes BBB permeability in Pten-mutant mice. Altogether, our work reveals the essential physiological function of the PTEN/AKT/NEDD4-2/MFSD2A axis in the regulation of BBB permeability.	Brain endothelial PTEN/AKT/NEDD4-2/MFSD2A axis regulates blood-brain barrier permeability.	Cell reports
34233182	NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent Ca(2+) influx underpins multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. Most synaptic NMDAR currents in the adult forebrain are mediated by GluN2A-containing receptors, which are rapidly inserted into synapses during long-term potentiation (LTP); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that GluN2A is phosphorylated at Ser-1459 by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) in response to glycine stimulation that mimics LTP in primary neurons. Phosphorylation of Ser-1459 promotes GluN2A interaction with the sorting nexin 27 (SNX27)-retromer complex, thereby enhancing the endosomal recycling of NMDARs. Loss of SNX27 or CaMKIIalpha function blocks the glycine-induced increase in GluN2A-NMDARs on the neuronal membrane. Interestingly, mutations of Ser-1459, including the rare S1459G human epilepsy variant, prolong the decay times of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in heterosynapses by increasing the duration of channel opening. These findings not only identify a critical role of Ser-1459 phosphorylation in regulating the function of NMDARs, but they also explain how the S1459G variant dysregulates NMDAR function.

34233183	Repair after traumatic injury often starts with mitotic activation around the lesion edges. Early midline cells in the Drosophila embryonic CNS can enter into division following the traumatic disruption of microtubules. We demonstrate that microtubule disruption activates non-canonical TNF signaling by phosphorylation of TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (Tak1) and its target IkappaB kinase (Ik2), culminating in Dorsal/NfkappaB nuclear translocation and Jra/Jun expression. Tak1 and Ik2 are necessary for the damaged-induced divisions. Microtubule disruption caused by Tau accumulation is also reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human Tau expression in Drosophila midline cells is sufficient to induce Tak1 phosphorylation, Dorsal and Jra/Jun expression, and entry into mitosis. Interestingly, activation of Tak1 and Tank binding kinase 1 (Tbk1), the human Ik2 ortholog, and NfkappaB upregulation are observed in AD brains.	Microtubule disruption upon CNS damage triggers mitotic entry via TNF signaling activation.	Cell reports
34233189	BAF chromatin remodeling complexes play important roles in chromatin regulation and cancer. Here, we report that Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on the autocrine signaling mediated by NELL2, a secreted glycoprotein that has been characterized as an axon guidance molecule. NELL2 uses Robo3 as the receptor to transmit critical growth signaling. NELL2 signaling inhibits cdc42 and upregulates BAF complexes and EWS-FLI1 transcriptional output. We demonstrate that cdc42 is a negative regulator of BAF complexes, inducing actin polymerization and complex disassembly. Furthermore, we identify NELL2(high)CD133(high)EWS-FLI1(high) and NELL2(low)CD133(low)EWS-FLI1(low) populations in Ewing sarcoma, which display phenotypes consistent with high and low NELL2 signaling, respectively. We show that NELL2, CD133, and EWS-FLI1 positively regulate each other and upregulate BAF complexes and cell proliferation in Ewing sarcoma. These results reveal a signaling pathway regulating critical chromatin remodeling complexes and cancer cell proliferation.	NELL2-cdc42 signaling regulates BAF complexes and Ewing sarcoma cell growth.

34233195	The R2TP (RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RPAP3-PIH1D1) complex, in collaboration with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), functions as a chaperone for the assembly and stability of protein complexes, including RNA polymerases, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases (PIKKs) such as TOR and SMG1. PIKK stabilization depends on an additional complex of TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2 (TTT), whose structure and function are poorly understood. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human R2TP-TTT complex, together with biochemical experiments, reveals the mechanism of TOR recruitment to the R2TP-TTT chaperone. The HEAT-repeat TTT complex binds the kinase domain of TOR, without blocking its activity, and delivers TOR to the R2TP chaperone. In addition, TTT regulates the R2TP chaperone by inhibiting RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity and by modulating the conformation and interactions of the PIH1D1 and RPAP3 components of R2TP. Taken together, our results show how TTT couples the recruitment of TOR to R2TP with the regulation of this chaperone system.

34233190	MED20 is a non-essential subunit of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator complex, but its physiological function remains largely unknown. Here, we identify MED20 as a substrate of the anti-obesity CRL4-WDTC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through affinity purification and candidate screening. Overexpression of WDTC1 leads to degradation of MED20, whereas depletion of WDTC1 or CUL4A/B causes accumulation of MED20. Depleting MED20 inhibits adipogenesis, and a non-degradable MED20 mutant restores adipogenesis in WDTC1-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, knockout of Med20 in preadipocytes abolishes development of brown adipose tissues. Removing one allele of Med20 in preadipocytes protects mice from diet-induced obesity and reverses weight gain in Cul4a- or Cul4b-depleted mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals that MED20 organizes the early adipogenic complex by bridging C/EBPbeta and RNA polymerase II to promote transcription of the central adipogenic factor, PPARgamma. Our findings have thus uncovered a critical role of MED20 in promoting adipogenesis, development of adipose tissue and diet-induced obesity.	The Mediator subunit MED20 organizes the early adipogenic complex to promote development of adipose tissues and diet-induced obesity.	Cell reports
34260942	Mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is tightly regulated by a complex network composed of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that allow proper organismal development. O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is the sole glycosylation mark found on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and plays a pivotal role in regulating fundamental cellular processes; however, its function in ESC pluripotency is still largely unexplored. Here, we identify O-GlcNAcylation of proteasome activator subunit 3 (Psme3) protein as a node of the ESC pluripotency network. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAc modification of serine 111 (S111) of Psme3 promotes degradation of Ddx6, which is essential for processing body (P-body) assembly, resulting in the maintenance of ESC pluripotent state. Conversely, loss of Psme3 S111 O-GlcNAcylation stabilizes Ddx6 and increases P-body levels, culminating in spontaneous exit of ESC from the pluripotent state. Our findings establish O-GlcNAcylation at S111 of Psme3 as a switch that regulates ESC pluripotency via control of P-body homeostasis.	Site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of Psme3 maintains mouse stem cell pluripotency by impairing P-body homeostasis.	Cell reports
34260911	Recombination activating genes (RAGs), consisting of RAG1 and RAG2, are stringently regulated lymphoid-specific genes, which initiate V(D)J recombination in developing lymphocytes. We report the regulation of RAG1 through a microRNA (miRNA), miR-29c, in a B cell stage-specific manner in mice and humans. Various lines of experimentation, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, demonstrate the target specificity and direct interaction of miR-29c to RAG1. Modulation of miR-29c levels leads to change in V(D)J recombination efficiency in pre-B cells. The miR-29c expression is inversely proportional to RAG1 in a B cell developmental stage-specific manner, and miR-29c null mice exhibit a reduction in mature B cells. A negative correlation of miR-29c and RAG1 levels is also observed in leukemia patients, suggesting the potential use of miR-29c as a biomarker and a therapeutic target. Thus, our results reveal the role of miRNA in the regulation of RAG1 and its relevance in cancer.	MicroRNA miR-29c regulates RAG1 expression and modulates V(D)J recombination during B cell development.	Cell reports
34260936	Neuronal activity-induced enhancers drive gene activation. We demonstrate that BRG1, the core subunit of SWI/SNF-like BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, regulates neuronal activity-induced enhancers. Upon stimulation, BRG1 is recruited to enhancers in an H3K27Ac-dependent manner. BRG1 regulates enhancer basal activities and inducibility by affecting cohesin binding, enhancer-promoter looping, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and enhancer RNA expression. We identify a serine phosphorylation site in BRG1 that is induced by neuronal stimulations and is sensitive to CaMKII inhibition. BRG1 phosphorylation affects its interaction with several transcription co-factors, including the NuRD repressor complex and cohesin, possibly modulating BRG1-mediated transcription outcomes. Using mice with knockin mutations, we show that non-phosphorylatable BRG1 fails to efficiently induce activity-dependent genes, whereas phosphomimic BRG1 increases enhancer activity and inducibility. These mutant mice display anxiety-like phenotypes and altered responses to stress. Therefore, we reveal a mechanism connecting neuronal signaling to enhancer activities through BRG1 phosphorylation.	Neuronal activity-induced BRG1 phosphorylation regulates enhancer activation.	Cell reports
34260916	Proper lung function relies on the precise balance of specialized epithelial cells that coordinate to maintain homeostasis. Herein, we describe essential roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ in maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis, reporting that conditional deletion of Yap and Wwtr1/Taz in the lung epithelium of adult mice results in severe defects, including alveolar disorganization and the development of airway mucin hypersecretion. Through in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro molecular experiments, we reveal that reduced YAP/TAZ activity promotes intrinsic goblet transdifferentiation of secretory airway epithelial cells. Global gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses suggest that YAP/TAZ act cooperatively with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors and the NuRD complex to suppress the goblet cell fate program, directly repressing the SPDEF gene. Collectively, our study identifies YAP/TAZ as critical factors in lung epithelial homeostasis and offers molecular insight into the mechanisms promoting goblet cell differentiation, which is a hallmark of many lung diseases.	Yap/Taz inhibit goblet cell fate to maintain lung epithelial homeostasis.	Cell reports
34260923	Upon nutrient stimulation, pre-adipocytes undergo differentiation to transform into mature adipocytes capable of storing nutrients as fat. We profiled cellular metabolite consumption to identify early metabolic drivers of adipocyte differentiation. We find that adipocyte differentiation raises the uptake and consumption of numerous amino acids. In particular, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism precedes and promotes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a key regulator of adipogenesis. In early adipogenesis, the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 elevates BCAA catabolism through the activation of methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (MCCC). MCCC supports leucine oxidation by catalyzing the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) expression is decreased in adipose tissue of numerous diabetic mouse models, and its expression is most correlated with BCAA enzymes, suggesting a potential role for SIRT4 in adipose pathology through the alteration of BCAA metabolism. In summary, this work provides a temporal analysis of adipocyte differentiation and uncovers early metabolic events that stimulate transcriptional reprogramming.	SIRT4 is an early regulator of branched-chain amino acid catabolism that promotes adipogenesis.	Cell reports
34260941	The chloroplast is the main organelle for stress-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how chloroplastic ROS homeostasis is maintained under salt stress is largely unknown. We show that EGY3, a gene encoding a chloroplast-localized protein, is induced by salt and oxidative stresses. The loss of EGY3 function causes stress hypersensitivity while EGY3 overexpression increases the tolerance to both salt and chloroplastic oxidative stresses. EGY3 interacts with chloroplastic Cu/Zn-SOD2 (CSD2) and promotes CSD2 stability under stress conditions. In egy3-1 mutant plants, the stress-induced CSD2 degradation limits H2O2 production in chloroplasts and impairs H2O2-mediated retrograde signaling, as indicated by the decreased expression of retrograde-signal-responsive genes required for stress tolerance. Both exogenous application of H2O2 (or APX inhibitor) and CSD2 overexpression can rescue the salt-stress hypersensitivity of egy3-1 mutants. Our findings reveal that EGY3 enhances the tolerance to salt stress by promoting the CSD2 stability and H2O2-mediated chloroplastic retrograde signaling.	EGY3 mediates chloroplastic ROS homeostasis and promotes retrograde signaling in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.	Cell reports
34260926	Stable transmission of genetic material during cell division requires accurate chromosome segregation. PLK1 dynamics at kinetochores control establishment of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments and subsequent silencing of the spindle checkpoint. However, the regulatory mechanism responsible for PLK1 activity in prometaphase has not yet been affirmatively identified. Here we identify Apolo1, which tunes PLK1 activity for accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Apolo1 localizes to kinetochores during early mitosis, and suppression of Apolo1 results in misaligned chromosomes. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PLK1 activity reporter, we found that Apolo1 sustains PLK1 kinase activity at kinetochores for accurate attachment during prometaphase. Apolo1 is a cognate substrate of PLK1, and the phosphorylation enables PP1gamma to inactivate PLK1 by dephosphorylation. Mechanistically, Apolo1 constitutes a bridge between kinase and phosphatase, which governs PLK1 activity in prometaphase. These findings define a previously uncharacterized feedback loop by which Apolo1 provides fine-tuning for PLK1 to guide chromosome segregation in mitosis.	Feedback control of PLK1 by Apolo1 ensures accurate chromosome segregation.	Cell reports
34289349	Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for male fertility. Here, we report that mouse SSC generation is driven by a transcription factor (TF) cascade controlled by the homeobox protein, RHOX10, which acts by driving the differentiation of SSC precursors called pro-spermatogonia (ProSG). We identify genes regulated by RHOX10 in ProSG in vivo and define direct RHOX10-target genes using several approaches, including a rapid temporal induction assay: iSLAMseq. Together, these approaches identify temporal waves of RHOX10 direct targets, as well as RHOX10 secondary-target genes. Many of the RHOX10-regulated genes encode proteins with known roles in SSCs. Using an in vitro ProSG differentiation assay, we find that RHOX10 promotes mouse ProSG differentiation through a conserved transcriptional cascade involving the key germ-cell TFs DMRT1 and ZBTB16. Our study gives important insights into germ cell development and provides a blueprint for how to define TF cascades.	RHOX10 drives mouse spermatogonial stem cell establishment through a transcription factor signaling cascade.	Cell reports
34289359	Many neurological disorders show an increased prevalence of GluA2-lacking, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), which dramatically alters synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this distinct synaptic plasticity remains enigmatic. Here, we show that nerve injury potentiates postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, CP-AMPARs in the spinal dorsal horn via alpha2delta-1. Overexpressing alpha2delta-1, previously regarded as a Ca(2+) channel subunit, augments CP-AMPAR levels at the cell surface and synapse. Mechanistically, alpha2delta-1 physically interacts with both GluA1 and GluA2 via its C terminus, inhibits the GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly, and increases GluA2 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, alpha2delta-1 diminishes the availability and synaptic expression of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the spinal cord in neuropathic pain. Inhibiting alpha2delta-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the alpha2delta-1-AMPAR complex fully restores the intracellular assembly and synaptic dominance of heteromeric GluA1/GluA2 receptors. Thus, alpha2delta-1 is a pivotal AMPAR-interacting protein that controls the subunit composition and Ca(2+) permeability of postsynaptic AMPARs.	alpha2delta-1 switches the phenotype of synaptic AMPA receptors by physically disrupting heteromeric subunit assembly.	Cell reports
34289353	Activity-dependent GABAergic synapse plasticity is important for normal brain functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Npas4 (neuronal PAS-domain protein 4) transcriptionally regulates the expression of IQSEC3, a GABAergic synapse-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-GEF) that directly interacts with gephyrin. Neuronal activation by an enriched environment induces Npas4-mediated upregulation of IQSEC3 protein specifically in CA1 stratum oriens layer somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. SST(+) interneuron-specific knockout (KO) of Npas4 compromises synaptic transmission in these GABAergic interneurons, increases neuronal activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and reduces anxiety behavior, all of which are normalized by the expression of wild-type IQSEC3, but not a dominant-negative ARF-GEF-inactive mutant, in SST(+) interneurons of Npas4-KO mice. Our results suggest that IQSEC3 is a key GABAergic synapse component that is directed by Npas4 and ARF activity, specifically in SST(+) interneurons, to orchestrate excitation-to-inhibition balance and control anxiety-like behavior.	Npas4 regulates IQSEC3 expression in hippocampal somatostatin interneurons to mediate anxiety-like behavior.	Cell reports
34320350	In glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and lethal brain tumor, therapies suppressing recurrently altered signaling pathways failed to extend survival. However, in patient subsets, specific genetic lesions can confer sensitivity to targeted agents. By exploiting an integrated model based on patient-derived stem-like cells, faithfully recapitulating the original GBMs in vitro and in vivo, here, we identify a human GBM subset ( approximately 9% of all GBMs) characterized by ERBB3 overexpression and nuclear accumulation. ERBB3 overexpression is driven by inheritable promoter methylation or post-transcriptional silencing of the oncosuppressor miR-205 and sustains the malignant phenotype. Overexpressed ERBB3 behaves as a specific signaling platform for fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), driving PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, and overall metabolic upregulation. As a result, ERBB3 inhibition by specific antibodies is lethal for GBM stem-like cells and xenotransplants. These findings highlight a subset of patients eligible for ERBB3-targeted therapy.	ERBB3 overexpression due to miR-205 inactivation confers sensitivity to FGF, metabolic activation, and liability to ERBB3 targeting in glioblastoma.	Cell reports
34320363	Metastasis is a complex and poorly understood process. In pancreatic cancer, loss of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/BMP effector SMAD4 is correlated with changes in altered histopathological transitions, metastatic disease, and poor prognosis. In this study, we use isogenic cancer cell lines to identify SMAD4 regulated genes that contribute to the development of metastatic colonization. We perform an in vivo screen identifying FOSL1 as both a SMAD4 target and sufficient to drive colonization to the lung. The targeting of these genes early in treatment may provide a therapeutic benefit.	SMAD4 represses FOSL1 expression and pancreatic cancer metastatic colonization.	Cell reports
34320342	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are inactivated by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), the activities of which are tightly regulated during cell differentiation. Using knockdown screening and single-cell transcriptional analysis, we demonstrate that DUSP4 is the phosphatase that specifically inactivates p38 kinase to promote megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation. Mechanistically, PRMT1-mediated methylation of DUSP4 triggers its ubiquitinylation by an E3 ligase HUWE1. Interestingly, the mechanistic axis of the DUSP4 degradation and p38 activation is also associated with a transcriptional signature of immune activation in Mk cells. In the context of thrombocytopenia observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we demonstrate that high levels of p38 MAPK and PRMT1 are associated with low platelet counts and adverse prognosis, while pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or PRMT1 stimulates megakaryopoiesis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the PRMT1-DUSP4-p38 axis on Mk differentiation and present a strategy for treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.	Methylation of dual-specificity phosphatase 4 controls cell differentiation.	Cell reports
34320338	During microbial infection, bystander CD8(+) T cells that are not specific to infecting pathogens can be activated by interleukin (IL)-15. However, the tissue-homing properties of bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells have not been elucidated. Here, we examine the effects of IL-15 on the expression of chemokine receptors on CD8(+) T cells and their migration. IL-15 upregulates CCR5 in memory CD8(+) T cells in the absence of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enhances CCR5-dependent migration. IL-15-induced CCR5 upregulation is abrogated by TCR stimulation, indicating that CCR5 is upregulated in bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, CCR5 signals increase proliferation and cytotoxic protein expression in IL-15-treated memory CD8(+) T cells, although the increase has a small extent. CCR5 upregulation in bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells is associated with severe liver injury in patients with acute hepatitis A. Altogether, the results indicate that CCR5 upregulation by IL-15 mediates the migration of bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells.	IL-15 enhances CCR5-mediated migration of memory CD8(+) T cells by upregulating CCR5 expression in the absence of TCR stimulation.	Cell reports
34348155	Pancreatic beta-cell failure is the key pathogenic element of the complex metabolic deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D); its underlying pathomechanism is still elusive. Here, we identify pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2 (PHLPP1/2) as phosphatases whose upregulation leads to beta-cell failure in diabetes. PHLPP levels are highly elevated in metabolically stressed human and rodent diabetic beta-cells. Sustained hyper-activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the primary mechanism of the PHLPP upregulation linking chronic metabolic stress to ultimate beta-cell death. PHLPPs directly dephosphorylate and regulate activities of beta-cell survival-dependent kinases AKT and MST1, constituting a regulatory triangle loop to control beta-cell apoptosis. Genetic inhibition of PHLPPs markedly improves beta-cell survival and function in experimental models of diabetes in vitro, in vivo, and in primary human T2D islets. Our study presents PHLPPs as targets for functional regenerative therapy of pancreatic beta cells in diabetes.	Inhibition of PHLPP1/2 phosphatases rescues pancreatic beta-cells in diabetes.

34348154	The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates vesicular trafficking and scaffolds signal transduction. Key upstream components of the exocyst include monomeric RAL GTPases, which help mount cell-autonomous responses to trophic and immunogenic signals. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics-based characterization of dynamic and signal-dependent exocyst protein interactomes. Under viral infection, an Exo84 exocyst subcomplex assembles the immune kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) together with the Hippo kinase Macrophage Stimulating 1 (MST1). PKR phosphorylates MST1 to activate Hippo signaling and inactivate Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). By contrast, a Sec5 exocyst subcomplex recruits another immune kinase, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which interacted with and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RALB was necessary and sufficient for induction of Hippo and mTOR signaling through parallel exocyst subcomplex engagement, supporting the cellular response to virus infection and oncogenic signaling. This study highlights RALB-exocyst signaling subcomplexes as mechanisms for the integrated engagement of Hippo and mTOR signaling in cells challenged by viral pathogens or oncogenic signaling.	Exocyst protein subnetworks integrate Hippo and mTOR signaling to promote virus detection and cancer.	Cell reports
34348143	Phenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for cell and organism evolution by natural selection. Whereas the role of stochastic gene expression in phenotypic diversity of genetically identical cells is well studied, not much is known regarding the relationship between stochastic gene expression and individual behavioral variation in animals. We demonstrate that a specific miRNA (miR-466f-3p) is upregulated in the hippocampus of a portion of individual inbred mice upon a Morris water maze task. Significantly, miR-466f-3p positively regulates the neuron morphology, function and spatial learning, and memory capability of mice. Mechanistically, miR-466f-3p represses translation of MEF2A, a negative regulator of learning/memory. Finally, we show that varied upregulation of hippocampal miR-466f-3p results from randomized phosphorylation of hippocampal cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) in individuals. This finding of modulation of spatial learning and memory via a randomized hippocampal signaling axis upon neuronal stimulation represents a demonstration of how variation in tissue gene expression lead to varied animal behavior.	Activation of a hippocampal CREB-pCREB-miRNA-MEF2 axis modulates individual variation of spatial learning and memory capability.	Cell reports
34348164	The evolutionarily conserved Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is a key antioxidant response pathway that protects cells/organisms against detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Impaired Nrf2 function is associated with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. However, the function of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in the developing nervous systems has not been established. Here we demonstrate a cell-autonomous role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, composed of CncC/Nrf2, Keap1, and MafS, in governing neuronal remodeling during Drosophila metamorphosis. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling is activated downstream of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Mechanistically, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated via cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of CncC in an importin- and ecdysone-signaling-dependent manner. Moreover, Nrf2-Keap1 signaling regulates dendrite pruning independent of its canonical antioxidant response pathway, acting instead through proteasomal degradation. This study reveals an epistatic link between the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway and steroid hormone signaling and demonstrates an antioxidant-independent but proteasome-dependent role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in neuronal remodeling.	The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated by steroid hormone signaling to govern neuronal remodeling.	Cell reports
34380035	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) controls hepatic lipid homeostasis and is the target of lipid-lowering fibrate drugs. PPARalpha activation represses expression of let-7 microRNA (miRNA), but the function of let-7 in PPARalpha signaling and lipid metabolism is unknown. In the current study, a hepatocyte-specific let-7b/c2 knockout (let7b/c2(DeltaHep)) mouse line is generated, and these mice are found to exhibit pronounced resistance to diet-induced obesity and fatty liver. Let-7 inhibition by hepatocyte-specific let-7 sponge expression shows similar phenotypes as let7b/c2(DeltaHep) mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis reveals that hepatic PPARalpha signaling is repressed in let7b/c2(DeltaHep) mice. Protein expression of the obligate PPARalpha heterodimer partner retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) is reduced in the livers of let7b/c2(DeltaHep) mice. Ring finger protein 8 (Rnf8), which is a direct target of let-7, is elevated in let7b/c2(DeltaHep) mouse liver and identified as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for RXRalpha. This study highlights a let-7-RNF8-RXRalpha regulatory axis that modulates hepatic lipid catabolism.	Feedback repression of PPARalpha signaling by Let-7 microRNA.	Cell reports
34380027	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta) activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and plays a crucial role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we examine whether PPARbeta/delta activation effects depend on growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a stress response cytokine that regulates energy metabolism. Pharmacological PPARbeta/delta activation increases GDF15 levels and ameliorates glucose intolerance, fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation, and activates AMPK in HFD-fed mice, whereas these effects are abrogated by the injection of a GDF15 neutralizing antibody and in Gdf15(-/-) mice. The AMPK-p53 pathway is involved in the PPARbeta/delta-mediated increase in GDF15, which in turn activates again AMPK. Consistently, Gdf15(-/-) mice show reduced AMPK activation in skeletal muscle, whereas GDF15 administration results in AMPK activation in this organ. Collectively, these data reveal a mechanism by which PPARbeta/delta activation increases GDF15 levels via AMPK and p53, which in turn mediates the metabolic effects of PPARbeta/delta by sustaining AMPK activation.	GDF15 mediates the metabolic effects of PPARbeta/delta by activating AMPK.	Cell reports
34380042	Humoral immunity relies on the efficient differentiation of memory B cells (MBCs) into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). T helper (Th) signals upregulate B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by potentiating Src family kinases through increasing CD45 phosphatase activity (CD45 PA). In this study, we show that high CD45 PA in MBCs enhances BCR signaling and is essential for their effective ASC differentiation. Mechanistically, Th signals upregulate CD45 PA through intensifying the surface binding of a CD45 ligand, Galectin-1. CD45 PA works as a sensor of T cell help and defines high-affinity germinal center (GC) plasma cell (PC) precursors characterized by IRF4 expression in vivo. Increasing T cell help in vitro results in an incremental CD45 PA increase and enhances ASC differentiation by facilitating effective induction of the transcription factors IRF4 and BLIMP1. This study connects Th signals with BCR signaling through Galectin-1-dependent regulation of CD45 PA and provides a mechanism for efficient ASC differentiation of MBCs.	Integration of T helper and BCR signals governs enhanced plasma cell differentiation of memory B cells by regulation of CD45 phosphatase activity.	Cell reports
34407394	In Caenorhabditis elegans, ROS generated in response to intestinal infection induces SKN-1, a protective transcription factor homologous to nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1 or 2 (NRF1/2) in mammals. Many factors regulate SKN-1, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that activates SKN-1 by phosphorylation. In this work, another positive regulator of SKN-1 is identified: NIPI-3, a Tribbles pseudokinase. NIPI-3 has been reported to protect against intestinal infection by negatively regulating the CCAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) bZIP transcription factor CEBP-1. Here we demonstrate that CEBP-1 positively regulates the vhp-1 transcript, which encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the p38 MAPK called PMK-1. The increased levels of VHP-1 caused by CEBP-1 transcriptional enhancement result in less PMK-1 phosphorylation, affecting SKN-1 activity and intestinal resistance to the pathogen. The data support a model in which NIPI-3's negative regulation of CEBP-1 decreases VHP-1 phosphatase activity, allowing increased stimulation of SKN-1 activity by the p38 MAPK phosphorylation cascade in the intestine.	Tribbles pseudokinase NIPI-3 regulates intestinal immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans by controlling SKN-1/Nrf activity.	Cell reports
34407399	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer, for which chemotherapy remains standard treatment and additional therapeutic targets are requisite. Here, we show that AML cells secrete the stem cell growth factor R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) to promote their self-renewal and prevent cell differentiation. Although RSPO2 is a well-known WNT agonist, we reveal that it maintains AML self-renewal WNT independently, by inhibiting BMP receptor signaling. Autocrine RSPO2 signaling is also required to prevent differentiation and to promote self-renewal in normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as primary AML cells. Comprehensive datamining reveals that RSPO2 expression is elevated in patients with AML of poor prognosis. Consistently, inhibiting RSPO2 prolongs survival in AML mouse xenograft models. Our study indicates that in AML, RSPO2 acts as an autocrine BMP antagonist to promote cancer cell renewal and may serve as a marker for poor prognosis.	RSPO2 inhibits BMP signaling to promote self-renewal in acute myeloid leukemia.	Cell reports
32315377	Aberrant detection of endogenous nucleic acids by the immune system can cause inflammatory disease. The scaffold function of the signaling kinase RIPK1 limits spontaneous activation of the nucleic acid sensor ZBP1. Consequently, loss of RIPK1 in keratinocytes induces ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and skin inflammation. Whether nucleic acid sensing is required to activate ZBP1 in RIPK1-deficient conditions and which immune pathways are associated with skin disease remained open questions. Using knock-in mice with disrupted ZBP1 nucleic acid-binding activity, we report that sensing of endogenous nucleic acids by ZBP1 is critical in driving skin pathology characterized by antiviral and IL-17 immune responses. Inducing ZBP1 expression by interferons triggers necroptosis in RIPK1-deficient keratinocytes, and epidermis-specific deletion of MLKL prevents disease, demonstrating that cell-intrinsic events cause inflammation. These findings indicate that dysregulated sensing of endogenous nucleic acid by ZBP1 can drive inflammation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of IL-17-driven inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis.	Sensing of endogenous nucleic acids by ZBP1 induces keratinocyte necroptosis and skin inflammation.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32324863	Ubiquitination is an essential mechanism in the control of antiviral immunity upon virus infection. Here, we identify a series of ubiquitination-modulating enzymes that are modulated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Notably, TRIM24 is down-regulated through direct transcriptional suppression induced by VSV-activated IRF3. Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I) induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV infection. Mechanistically, VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation to mitochondria, where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its association with MAVS and TBK1, which consequently activates downstream antiviral signaling. Together, these findings establish TRIM24 as a critical positive regulator in controlling the activation of antiviral signaling and describe a previously unknown mechanism of TRIM24 function.	TRIM24 facilitates antiviral immunity through mediating K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32399548	A Th2 immune response is central to allergic airway inflammation, which afflicts millions worldwide. However, the mechanisms that augment GATA3 expression in an antigen-primed developing Th2 cell are not well understood. Here, we describe an unexpected role for Blimp-1, a transcriptional repressor that constrains autoimmunity, as an upstream promoter of GATA3 expression that is critical for Th2 cell development in the lung to inhaled but not systemically delivered allergens but is dispensable for TFH function and IgE production. Mechanistically, Blimp-1 acts through Bcl6, leading to increased GATA3 expression in lung Th2 cells. Surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-21, is required via STAT3 activation to up-regulate Blimp-1 and promote Th2 cell development. These data reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for an IL-10-STAT3-Blimp-1 circuit as an initiator of an inflammatory Th2 response in the lung to allergens. Thus, Blimp-1 in a context-dependent fashion can drive inflammation by promoting rather than terminating effector T cell responses.	Blimp-1 is essential for allergen-induced asthma and Th2 cell development in the lung.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32441762	Approximately one third of cancer patients die due to complexities related to cachexia. However, the mechanisms of cachexia and the potential therapeutic interventions remain poorly studied. We observed a significant positive correlation between SIRT1 expression and muscle fiber cross-sectional area in pancreatic cancer patients. Rescuing Sirt1 expression by exogenous expression or pharmacological agents reverted cancer cell-induced myotube wasting in culture conditions and mouse models. RNA-seq and follow-up analyses showed cancer cell-mediated SIRT1 loss induced NF-kappaB signaling in cachectic muscles that enhanced the expression of FOXO transcription factors and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a key regulator of reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between NOX4 expression and skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area in pancreatic cancer patients. Knocking out Nox4 in skeletal muscles or pharmacological blockade of Nox4 activity abrogated tumor-induced cachexia in mice. Thus, we conclude that targeting the Sirt1-Nox4 axis in muscles is an effective therapeutic intervention for mitigating pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.	SIRT1-NOX4 signaling axis regulates cancer cachexia.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32434218	Despite a critical role for MYC as an effector of oncogenic RAS, strategies to target MYC activity in RAS-driven cancers are lacking. In genetically engineered mouse models of lung and pancreatic cancer, oncogenic KRAS is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis, while addition of modest MYC overexpression drives robust tumor formation, suggesting that mechanisms beyond the RAS pathway play key roles in MYC regulation and RAS-driven tumorigenesis. Here we show that acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) cooperates with cancer cell-autonomous signals to increase MYC level, promoter occupancy, and activity. FGF1 is necessary and sufficient for paracrine regulation of MYC protein stability, signaling through AKT and GSK-3beta to increase MYC half-life. Patient specimens reveal a strong correlation between stromal CAF content and MYC protein level in the neoplastic compartment, and identify CAFs as the specific source of FGF1 in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our findings demonstrate that MYC is coordinately regulated by cell-autonomous and microenvironmental signals, and establish CAF-derived FGF1 as a novel paracrine regulator of oncogenic transcription.	Acidic fibroblast growth factor underlies microenvironmental regulation of MYC in pancreatic cancer.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32484502	Upon immunogenic challenge, lymph nodes become mechanically stiff as immune cells activate and proliferate within their encapsulated environments, and with resolution, they reestablish a soft baseline state. Here we show that sensing these mechanical changes in the microenvironment requires the mechanosensor YAP. YAP is induced upon activation and suppresses metabolic reprogramming of effector T cells. Unlike in other cell types in which YAP promotes proliferation, YAP in T cells suppresses proliferation in a stiffness-dependent manner by directly restricting the translocation of NFAT1 into the nucleus. YAP slows T cell responses in systemic viral infections and retards effector T cells in autoimmune diabetes. Our work reveals a paradigm whereby tissue mechanics fine-tune adaptive immune responses in health and disease.	Mechanosensing through YAP controls T cell activation and metabolism.

32453420	CDC-like kinase 3 (CLK3) is a dual specificity kinase that functions on substrates containing serine/threonine and tyrosine. But its role in human cancer remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that CLK3 was significantly up-regulated in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and identified a recurrent Q607R somatic substitution that represented a gain-of-function mutation in the CLK3 kinase domain. Gene ontology term enrichment suggested that high CLK3 expression in CCA patients mainly was associated with nucleotide metabolism reprogramming, which was further confirmed by comparing metabolic profiling of CCA cells. CLK3 directly phosphorylated USP13 at Y708, which promoted its binding to c-Myc, thereby preventing Fbxl14-mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and activating the transcription of purine metabolic genes. Notably, the CCA-associated CLK3-Q607R mutant induced USP13-Y708 phosphorylation and enhanced the activity of c-Myc. In turn, c-Myc transcriptionally up-regulated CLK3. Finally, we identified tacrine hydrochloride as a potential drug to inhibit aberrant CLK3-induced CCA. These findings demonstrate that CLK3 plays a crucial role in CCA purine metabolism, suggesting a potential therapeutic utility.	Targeting CLK3 inhibits the progression of cholangiocarcinoma by reprogramming nucleotide metabolism.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32438408	Talin critically controls integrin-dependent cell migration, but its regulatory role in skin dendritic cells (DCs) during inflammatory responses has not been investigated. Here, we show that talin1 regulates not only integrin-dependent Langerhans cell (LC) migration, but also MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR)-stimulated DC activation. Talin1-deficient LCs failed to exit the epidermis, resulting in reduced LC migration to skin-draining lymph nodes (sdLNs) and defective skin tolerance induction, while talin1-deficient dermal DCs unexpectedly accumulated in the dermis despite their actomyosin-dependent migratory capabilities. Furthermore, talin1-deficient DCs exhibited compromised chemotaxis, NFkappaB activation, and proinflammatory cytokine production. Mechanistically, talin1 was required for the formation of preassembled TLR complexes in DCs at steady state via direct interaction with MyD88 and PIP5K. Local production of PIP2 by PIP5K then recruited TIRAP to the preassembled complexes, which were required for TLR signalosome assembly during DC activation. Thus, talin1 regulates MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathways in DCs through a novel mechanism with implications for antimicrobial and inflammatory immune responses.	Talin1 controls dendritic cell activation by regulating TLR complex assembly and signaling.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32510550	Tumor cells rely on glutamine to fulfill their metabolic demands and sustain proliferation. The elevated consumption of glutamine can lead to intratumoral nutrient depletion, causing metabolic stress that has the potential to impact tumor progression. Here, we show that nutrient stress caused by glutamine deprivation leads to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that glutamine deficiency regulates EMT through the up-regulation of the EMT master regulator Slug, a process that is dependent on both MEK/ERK signaling and ATF4. We find that Slug is required in PDAC cells for glutamine deprivation-induced EMT, cell motility, and nutrient stress survival. Importantly, we decipher that Slug is associated with nutrient stress in PDAC tumors and is required for metastasis. These results delineate a novel role for Slug in the nutrient stress response and provide insight into how nutrient depletion might influence PDAC progression.	Glutamine depletion regulates Slug to promote EMT and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32717081	Kidney glomerulosclerosis commonly progresses to end-stage kidney failure, but pathogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that podocyte expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a complement C3 convertase regulator, crucially controls disease in murine models of adriamycin (ADR)-induced focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic glomerulosclerosis. ADR induces enzymatic cleavage of DAF from podocyte surfaces, leading to complement activation. C3 deficiency or prevention of C3a receptor (C3aR) signaling abrogates disease despite DAF deficiency, confirming complement dependence. Mechanistic studies show that C3a/C3aR ligations on podocytes initiate an autocrine IL-1beta/IL-1R1 signaling loop that reduces nephrin expression, causing actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Uncoupling IL-1beta/IL-1R1 signaling prevents disease, providing a causal link. Glomeruli of patients with FSGS lack DAF and stain positive for C3d, and urinary C3a positively correlates with the degree of proteinuria. Together, our data indicate that the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis involve loss of podocyte DAF, triggering local, complement-dependent, IL-1beta-induced podocyte injury, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets.	Loss of decay-accelerating factor triggers podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32697823	Th17 cell differentiation and pathogenicity depend on metabolic reprogramming inducing shifts toward glycolysis. Here, we show that the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme required for cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression, is a key factor mediating Th17 cell differentiation and autoimmune inflammation. We found that PKM2 is highly expressed throughout the differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) development. Strikingly, PKM2 is not required for the metabolic reprogramming and proliferative capacity of Th17 cells. However, T cell-specific PKM2 deletion impairs Th17 cell differentiation and ameliorates symptoms of EAE by decreasing Th17 cell-mediated inflammation and demyelination. Mechanistically, PKM2 translocates into the nucleus and interacts with STAT3, enhancing its activation and thereby increasing Th17 cell differentiation. Thus, PKM2 acts as a critical nonmetabolic regulator that fine-tunes Th17 cell differentiation and function in autoimmune-mediated inflammation.	PKM2 promotes Th17 cell differentiation and autoimmune inflammation by fine-tuning STAT3 activation.	The Journal of experimental medicine
32609329	The establishment of protective humoral immunity is dependent on the ability of mature B cells to undergo antibody gene diversification while adjusting to the physiological stressors induced by activation with the antigen. Mature B cells diversify their antibody genes by class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), which are both dependent on efficient induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Here, we identified PDGFA-associated protein 1 (Pdap1) as an essential regulator of cellular homeostasis in mature B cells. Pdap1 deficiency leads to sustained expression of the integrated stress response (ISR) effector activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and induction of the ISR transcriptional program, increased cell death, and defective AID expression. As a consequence, loss of Pdap1 reduces germinal center B cell formation and impairs CSR and SHM. Thus, Pdap1 protects mature B cells against chronic ISR activation and ensures efficient antibody diversification by promoting their survival and optimal function.

32860047	PD-L1 up-regulation in cancer contributes to immune evasion by tumor cells. Here, we show that Wnt ligand and activated EGFR induce the binding of the beta-catenin/TCF/LEF complex to the CD274 gene promoter region to induce PD-L1 expression, in which AKT activation plays an important role. beta-Catenin depletion, AKT inhibition, or PTEN expression reduces PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, enhances activation and tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and reduces tumor growth, accompanied by prolonged mouse survival. Combined treatment with a clinically available AKT inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody overcomes tumor immune evasion and greatly inhibits tumor growth. In addition, AKT-mediated beta-catenin S552 phosphorylation and nuclear beta-catenin are positively correlated with PD-L1 expression and inversely correlated with the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells in human glioblastoma specimens, highlighting the clinical significance of beta-catenin activation in tumor immune evasion.	beta-Catenin induces transcriptional expression of PD-L1 to promote glioblastoma immune evasion.

32991666	Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with the pathological characteristic of white matter injury often leads to lifelong cognitive and neurobehavioral dysfunction, but relevant therapies to promote remyelination are still unavailable. We found that histamine H2 receptor (H2R) negatively regulated the oligodendrocyte differentiation rate without affecting the oligodendrocytes at the oligodendrocyte precursor cell stage or mature stage following oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. Notably, selective deletion of the H2R gene (Hrh2) in differentiating oligodendrocytes (Hrh2fl/fl;CNPase-Cre) improved their differentiation, remyelination, and functional recovery following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia in mice. The regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation by H2R is mediated by binding with Axin2, which leads to up-regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, H2R antagonists also promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination and the recovery of cognition and motor functions following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. Thus, histamine H2R in oligodendrocytes could serve as a novel and effective therapeutic target for the retard of oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The H2R antagonists may have potential therapeutic value for neonatal HIE.	Histamine H2 receptor negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic white matter injury.

32986812	Posttranslational modification with SUMO is known to regulate the activity of transcription factors, but how SUMOylation of individual proteins might influence immunity is largely unexplored. The NFAT transcription factors play an essential role in antigen receptor-mediated gene regulation. SUMOylation of NFATc1 represses IL-2 in vitro, but its role in T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo is unclear. To this end, we generated a novel transgenic mouse in which SUMO modification of NFATc1 is prevented. Avoidance of NFATc1 SUMOylation ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as well as graft-versus-host disease. Elevated IL-2 production in T cells promoted T reg expansion and suppressed autoreactive or alloreactive immune responses. Mechanistically, increased IL-2 secretion counteracted IL-17 and IFN-gamma expression through STAT5 and Blimp-1 induction. Then, Blimp-1 repressed IL-2 itself, as well as the induced, proliferation-associated survival factor Bcl2A1. Collectively, these data demonstrate that prevention of NFATc1 SUMOylation fine-tunes T cell responses toward lasting tolerance. Thus, targeting NFATc1 SUMOylation presents a novel and promising strategy to treat T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.	Lack of NFATc1 SUMOylation prevents autoimmunity and alloreactivity.

33346797	Podocyte injury is a common hallmark in various glomerular diseases. The level of LRRC55 was increased in podocytes of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and membranous nephropathy (MN). Upregulated LRRC55 and increased intracellular Ca2+ led to BK channel activation and the loss of intracellular potassium, resulting in apoptosome formation and caspase-3 activation in angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated podocytes. Knockout of Lrrc55 or the BK channel prevented the BK current and ameliorated podocyte injury in Ang II-treated mice. Upstream, NFATc3 regulated the expression of LRRC55. Increased LRRC55 expression in podocytes was also evident in animal models of FSGS, DN, and MN. Treatment with losartan or LRRC55 siRNA suppressed LRRC55 expression, prevented BK channel activation, and attenuated podocyte injury in animal models of FSGS, DN, and MN. In conclusion, upregulated LRRC55 promotes BK channel activation and aggravates cell injury in podocytes in FSGS, DN, and MN. LRRC55 inhibition may represent a new therapeutic approach for podocyte injury.	Upregulated LRRC55 promotes BK channel activation and aggravates cell injury in podocytes.

33355624	Autophagy programs the metabolic and functional fitness of regulatory T (T reg) cells to establish immune tolerance, yet the mechanisms governing autophagy initiation in T reg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZFP91 facilitates autophagy activation to sustain T reg cell metabolic programming and functional integrity. T reg cell-specific deletion of Zfp91 caused T reg cell dysfunction and exacerbated colonic inflammation and inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis. TCR-triggered autophagy induction largely relied on T reg cell-derived ZFP91 to restrict hyperglycolysis, which is required for the maintenance of T reg cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, ZFP91 rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR stimulation and then mediated BECN1 ubiquitination to promote BECN1-PIK3C3 complex formation. Therefore, our results highlight a ZFP91-dependent mechanism promoting TCR-initiated autophagosome maturation to maintain T reg cell homeostasis and function.	ZFP91 is required for the maintenance of regulatory T cell homeostasis and function.	The Journal of experimental medicine
33125052	During thymocyte development, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) provide appropriate instructive cues in the thymic microenvironment for not only negative selection but also the generation of regulatory T (T reg) cells. Here, we identify that miR-155, a microRNA whose expression in T reg cells has previously been shown to be crucial for their development and homeostasis, also contributes to thymic T reg (tT reg) cell differentiation by promoting mTEC maturation. Mechanistically, we show that RANKL stimulation induces expression of miR-155 to safeguard the thymic medulla through targeting multiple known and previously uncharacterized molecules within the TGFbeta signaling pathway, which is recognized for its role in restricting the maturation and expansion of mTECs. Our work uncovers a miR-155-TGFbeta axis in the thymic medulla to determine mTEC maturity and, consequently, the quantity of tT reg cells and suggests that miR-155 ensures proper tT reg cell development in both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic manners.	miR-155 promotes T reg cell development by safeguarding medullary thymic epithelial cell maturation.

33710283	The role of the PYHIN family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), another important inflammasome sensor, in EAE remains unclear. In this study, we found that AIM2 negatively regulates the pathogenesis of EAE independent of inflammasome activation. AIM2 deficiency enhanced microglia activation and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, thereby promoting neuroinflammation and demyelination during EAE. Mechanistically, AIM2 negatively regulates the DNA-PK-AKT3 in microglia to control neuroinflammation synergistically induced by cGAS and DNA-PK. Administration of a DNA-PK inhibitor reduced the severity of the EAE. Collectively, these findings identify a new role for AIM2 in controlling the onset of EAE. Furthermore, delineation of the underlying inflammasome-independent mechanism highlights cGAS and DNA-PK signaling as potential targets for the treatment of heterogeneous MS.

33755722	The oncogene DEK is found fused with the NUP214 gene creating oncoprotein DEK-NUP214 that induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients, and secreted DEK protein functions as a hematopoietic cytokine to regulate hematopoiesis; however, the intrinsic role of nuclear DEK in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains largely unknown. Here, we show that HSCs lacking DEK display defects in long-term self-renew capacity, eventually resulting in impaired hematopoiesis. DEK deficiency reduces quiescence and accelerates mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs, in part, dependent upon activating mTOR signaling. At the molecular level, DEK recruits the corepressor NCoR1 to repress acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and restricts the chromatin accessibility of HSCs, governing the expression of quiescence-associated genes (e.g., Akt1/2, Ccnb2, and p21). Inhibition of mTOR activity largely restores the maintenance and potential of Dek-cKO HSCs. These findings highlight the crucial role of nuclear DEK in preserving HSC potential, uncovering a new link between chromatin remodelers and HSC homeostasis, and have clinical implications.	Nuclear DEK preserves hematopoietic stem cells potential via NCoR1/HDAC3-Akt1/2-mTOR axis.	The Journal of experimental medicine
33688917	Although widely used for their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, the prescription of glucocorticoid analogues (e.g., dexamethasone) has been associated with deleterious glucose metabolism, compromising their long-term therapeutic use. However, the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. In the present study, through transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of two mouse models, we identified a growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta (Gadd45beta)-dependent pathway that stimulates hepatic glucose production (HGP). Functional studies showed that overexpression of Gadd45beta in vivo or in cultured hepatocytes activates gluconeogenesis and increases HGP. In contrast, liver-specific Gadd45beta-knockout mice were resistant to high-fat diet- or steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Of pathophysiological significance, hepatic Gadd45beta expression is up-regulated in several mouse models of obesity and diabetic patients. Mechanistically, Gadd45beta promotes DNA demethylation of PGC-1alpha promoter in conjunction with TET1, thereby stimulating PGC-1alpha expression to promote gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia. Collectively, these findings unveil an epigenomic signature involving Gadd45beta/TET1/DNA demethylation in hepatic glucose metabolism, enabling the identification of pathogenic factors in diabetes.	Hepatic Gadd45beta promotes hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance through DNA demethylation of PGC-1alpha.	The Journal of experimental medicine
33779682	Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a life-threatening disease for which there is a lack of effective therapy preventing aortic rupture. During AAA formation, pathological vascular remodeling is driven by macrophage infiltration, and the mechanisms regulating macrophage-mediated inflammation remain undefined. Recent evidence suggests that an epigenetic enzyme, JMJD3, plays a critical role in establishing macrophage phenotype. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of human AAA tissues, we identified increased JMJD3 in aortic monocyte/macrophages resulting in up-regulation of an inflammatory immune response. Mechanistically, we report that interferon-beta regulates Jmjd3 expression via JAK/STAT and that JMJD3 induces NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription in infiltrating aortic macrophages. In vivo targeted inhibition of JMJD3 with myeloid-specific genetic depletion (JMJD3f/fLyz2Cre+) or pharmacological inhibition in the elastase or angiotensin II-induced AAA model preserved the repressive H3K27me3 on inflammatory gene promoters and markedly reduced AAA expansion and attenuated macrophage-mediated inflammation. Together, our findings suggest that cell-specific pharmacologic therapy targeting JMJD3 may be an effective intervention for AAA expansion.	Inhibition of macrophage histone demethylase JMJD3 protects against abdominal aortic aneurysms.	The Journal of experimental medicine
33914044	TGFbeta is essential for the generation of anti-tumor Th9 cells; on the other hand, it causes resistance against anti-tumor immunity. Despite recent progress, the underlying mechanism reconciling the double-edged effect of TGFbeta signaling in Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy remains elusive. Here, we find that TGFbeta-induced down-regulation of bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) represents the key mechanism preventing the sustained activation of TGFbeta signaling and thus impairing Th9 inducibility. Mechanistically, BFAR mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of TGFbetaR1 at K268, which is critical to activate TGFbeta signaling. Thus, BFAR deficiency or K268R knock-in mutation suppresses TGFbetaR1 ubiquitination and Th9 differentiation, thereby inhibiting Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy. More interestingly, BFAR-overexpressed Th9 cells exhibit promising therapeutic efficacy to curtail tumor growth and metastasis and promote the sensitivity of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint immunotherapy. Thus, our findings establish BFAR as a key TGFbeta-regulated gene to fine-tune TGFbeta signaling that causes Th9 induction insensitivity, and they highlight the translational potential of BFAR in promoting Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy.	BFAR coordinates TGFbeta signaling to modulate Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy.	The Journal of experimental medicine
34143182	Central precocious puberty (CPP), largely caused by germline mutations in the MKRN3 gene, has been epidemiologically linked to cancers. MKRN3 is frequently mutated in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with five cohorts. Genomic MKRN3 aberrations are significantly enriched in NSCLC samples harboring oncogenic KRAS mutations. Low MKRN3 expression levels correlate with poor patient survival. Reconstitution of MKRN3 in MKRN3-inactivated NSCLC cells directly abrogates in vitro and in vivo tumor growth and proliferation. MKRN3 knockout mice are susceptible to urethane-induced lung cancer, and lung cell-specific knockout of endogenous MKRN3 accelerates NSCLC tumorigenesis in vivo. A mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen identified PABPC1 as a major substrate for MKRN3. The tumor suppressor function of MKRN3 is dependent on its E3 ligase activity, and MKRN3 missense mutations identified in patients substantially compromise MKRN3-mediated PABPC1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, MKRN3 modulates cell proliferation through PABPC1 nonproteolytic ubiquitination and subsequently, PABPC1-mediated global protein synthesis. Our integrated approaches demonstrate that the CPP-associated gene MKRN3 is a tumor suppressor.	E3 ligase MKRN3 is a tumor suppressor regulating PABPC1 ubiquitination in non-small cell lung cancer.

32516305	Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway targeting organelles and macromolecules, thereby regulating various cellular functions. Phosphorylation is a key posttranscriptional protein modification implicated in the regulation of biological function including autophagy. Under asynchronous conditions, autophagy activity is predominantly suppressed by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, but whether autophagy-related genes (ATG) proteins are phosphorylated differentially throughout the sequential phases of the cell cycle remains unclear. In this issue, Li and colleagues report that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates the ULK complex during mitosis. This phosphorylation induces autophagy and, surprisingly, is shown to drive cell cycle progression. This work reveals a yet-unappreciated role for autophagy in cell cycle progression and enhances our understanding of the specific phase-dependent autophagy regulation during cellular growth and proliferation.	Mitotic phosphorylation of the ULK complex regulates cell cycle progression.	PLoS biology
32520957	In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1alpha) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1alpha/X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was induced independent of IFNgamma signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1 regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1alpha- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells. Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1alpha gene signature and CD274 gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow-derived macrophages with IRE1alpha deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of regulated IRE1alpha-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate CD274 gene expression. Thus, the IRE1alpha/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to failure of local immune surveillance.	IRE1alpha regulates macrophage polarization, PD-L1 expression, and tumor survival.	PLoS biology
32603375	Coordination of gene expression with nutrient availability supports proliferation and homeostasis and is shaped by protein acetylation. Yet how physiological/pathological signals link acetylation to specific gene expression programs and whether such responses are cell-type-specific is unclear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor, activated by glucose limitation to resolve nutrient supply-demand imbalances, critical for diabetes and cancer. Unexpectedly, we show here that, in gastrointestinal cancer cells, glucose activates AMPK to selectively induce EP300, but not CREB-binding protein (CBP). Consequently, EP300 is redirected away from nuclear receptors that promote differentiation towards beta-catenin, a driver of proliferation and colorectal tumorigenesis. Importantly, blocking glycogen synthesis permits reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and AMPK activation in response to glucose in previously nonresponsive cells. Notably, glycogen content and activity of the ROS/AMPK/EP300/beta-catenin axis are opposite in healthy versus tumor sections. Glycogen content reduction from healthy to tumor tissue may explain AMPK switching from tumor suppressor to activator during tumor evolution.	Paradoxical activation of AMPK by glucose drives selective EP300 activity in colorectal cancer.	PLoS biology
32702011	Maternal beta-catenin activity is essential and critical for dorsal induction and its dorsal activation has been thoroughly studied. However, how the maternal beta-catenin activity is suppressed in the nondorsal cells remains poorly understood. Nanog is known to play a central role for maintenance of the pluripotency and maternal -zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we reveal a novel role of Nanog as a strong repressor of maternal beta-catenin signaling to safeguard the embryo against hyperactivation of maternal beta-catenin activity and hyperdorsalization. In zebrafish, knockdown of nanog at different levels led to either posteriorization or dorsalization, mimicking zygotic or maternal activation of Wnt/beta-catenin activities, and the maternal zygotic mutant of nanog (MZnanog) showed strong activation of maternal beta-catenin activity and hyperdorsalization. Although a constitutive activator-type Nanog (Vp16-Nanog, lacking the N terminal) perfectly rescued the MZT defects of MZnanog, it did not rescue the phenotypes resulting from beta-catenin signaling activation. Mechanistically, the N terminal of Nanog directly interacts with T-cell factor (TCF) and interferes with the binding of beta-catenin to TCF, thereby attenuating the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. Therefore, our study establishes a novel role for Nanog in repressing maternal beta-catenin activity and demonstrates a transcriptional switch between beta-catenin/TCF and Nanog/TCF complexes, which safeguards the embryo from global activation of maternal beta-catenin activity.	Nanog safeguards early embryogenesis against global activation of maternal beta-catenin activity by interfering with TCF factors.	PLoS biology
32692742	Tight regulation of gene transcription and mRNA splicing is essential for plant growth and development. Here we demonstrate that a plant-specific protein, EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 1579 (EMB1579), controls multiple growth and developmental processes in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that EMB1579 forms liquid-like condensates both in vitro and in vivo, and the formation of normal-sized EMB1579 condensates is crucial for its cellular functions. We found that some chromosomal and RNA-related proteins interact with EMB1579 compartments, and loss of function of EMB1579 affects global gene transcription and mRNA splicing. Using floral transition as a physiological process, we demonstrate that EMB1579 is involved in FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)-mediated repression of flowering. Interestingly, we found that EMB1579 physically interacts with a homologue of Drosophila nucleosome remodeling factor 55-kDa (p55) called MULTIPLE SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 4 (MSI4), which has been implicated in repressing the expression of FLC by forming a complex with DNA Damage Binding Protein 1 (DDB1) and Cullin 4 (CUL4). This complex, named CUL4-DDB1MSI4, physically associates with a CURLY LEAF (CLF)-containing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (CLF-PRC2). We further demonstrate that EMB1579 interacts with CUL4 and DDB1, and EMB1579 condensates can recruit and condense MSI4 and DDB1. Furthermore, emb1579 phenocopies msi4 in terms of the level of H3K27 trimethylation on FLC. This allows us to propose that EMB1579 condensates recruit and condense CUL4-DDB1MSI4 complex, which facilitates the interaction of CUL4-DDB1MSI4 with CLF-PRC2 and promotes the role of CLF-PRC2 in establishing and/or maintaining the level of H3K27 trimethylation on FLC. Thus, we report a new mechanism for regulating plant gene transcription, mRNA splicing, and growth and development.	Phase separation of Arabidopsis EMB1579 controls transcription, mRNA splicing, and development.	PLoS biology
32678845	The evolution of transformed cancer cells into metastatic tumors is, in part, driven by altered intracellular signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The surface levels and activity of RTKs are governed mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), endosomal recycling, or degradation. In turn, oncogenic signaling downstream of RTKs can reciprocally regulate endocytic trafficking by creating feedback loops in cells to enhance tumor progression. We previously showed that FCH/F-BAR and Double SH3 Domain-Containing Protein (FCHSD2) has a cancer-cell specific function in regulating CME in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that FCHSD2 loss impacts recycling of the RTKs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proto-oncogene c-Met (MET), and shunts their trafficking into late endosomes and lysosomal degradation. Notably, FCHSD2 depletion results in the nuclear translocation of active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), leading to enhanced transcription and up-regulation of EGFR and MET. The small GTPase, Ras-related protein Rab-7A (Rab7), is essential for the FCHSD2 depletion-induced effects. Correspondingly, FCHSD2 loss correlates to higher tumor grades of NSCLC. Clinically, NSCLC patients expressing high FCHSD2 exhibit elevated survival, whereas patients with high Rab7 expression display decreased survival rates. Our study provides new insight into the molecular nexus for crosstalk between oncogenic signaling and RTK trafficking that controls cancer progression.	FCHSD2 controls oncogenic ERK1/2 signaling outcome by regulating endocytic trafficking.	PLoS biology
32817651	Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to cellular senescence, which contributes to advanced age-related disorders, it is unclear how Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), an essential transcriptional factor of cardiovascular remodeling, mediates the link between mitochondrial dynamics and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Here, we show that Klf5 down-regulation in VSMCs is correlated with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), an age-related vascular disease. Mice lacking Klf5 in VSMCs exacerbate vascular senescence and progression of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA by facilitating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Klf5 knockdown enhances, while Klf5 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, Klf5 activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) transcription through binding to the promoter of eIF5a, which in turn preserves mitochondrial integrity by interacting with mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). Accordingly, decreased expression of eIF5a elicited by Klf5 down-regulation leads to mitochondrial fission and excessive ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission decreases ROS production and VSMC senescence. Our studies provide a potential therapeutic target for age-related vascular disorders.	Klf5 down-regulation induces vascular senescence through eIF5a depletion and mitochondrial fission.	PLoS biology
32881857	The small GTPase RhoA is a central signaling enzyme that is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, and cell cycle progression. Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA-for instance, Galphaq-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via Galphaq-dependent activation of RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca2+/PKC, respectively, and further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal regulation.	Histamine-induced biphasic activation of RhoA allows for persistent RhoA signaling.	PLoS biology
33017390	Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Abeta phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5xFAD) mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Abeta was then impaired, and therefore Peli1 depletion suppressed the Abeta deposition in the brains of 5xFAD mice. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)beta, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of C/EBPbeta and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPbeta and the expression of CD36 and thus, promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of microglia-mediated neurological diseases.	Peli1 impairs microglial Abeta phagocytosis through promoting C/EBPbeta degradation.	PLoS biology
33186350	Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells, mouse models, and patients' tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient's survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer.	Nucleotide de novo synthesis increases breast cancer stemness and metastasis via cGMP-PKG-MAPK signaling pathway.	PLoS biology
33351793	Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRSS101D/S241D, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRSS101A/S241A, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the VEGFA promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRSS101A/S241A strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.	Phosphorylation of seryl-tRNA synthetase by ATM/ATR is essential for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.	PLoS biology
33362237	Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (LSM12) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (EPAC1) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the C9ORF72-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, LSM12 posttranscriptionally up-regulated EPAC1 expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in LSM12-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of LSM12 and EPAC1. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin beta1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the LSM12-EPAC1 pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.

33630828	The Hippo-YAP pathway responds to diverse environmental cues to manage tissue homeostasis, organ regeneration, tumorigenesis, and immunity. However, how phosphatase(s) directly target Yes-associated protein (YAP) and determine its physiological activity are still inconclusive. Here, we utilized an unbiased phosphatome screening and identified protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A/PP2Calpha) as the bona fide and physiological YAP phosphatase. We found that PPM1A was associated with YAP/TAZ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to directly eliminate phospho-S127 on YAP, which conferring YAP the nuclear distribution and transcription potency. Accordingly, genetic ablation or depletion of PPM1A in cells, organoids, and mice elicited an enhanced YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention and resulted in the diminished cell proliferation, severe gut regeneration defects in colitis, and impeded liver regeneration upon injury. These regeneration defects in murine model were largely rescued via a genetic large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) deficiency or the pharmacological inhibition of Hippo-YAP signaling. Therefore, we identify a physiological phosphatase of YAP/TAZ, describe its critical effects in YAP/TAZ cellular distribution, and demonstrate its physiological roles in mammalian organ regeneration.	The protein phosphatase PPM1A dephosphorylates and activates YAP to govern mammalian intestinal and liver regeneration.	PLoS biology
33626035	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling plays a critical role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. DeltaNp63alpha, the major isoform of p63 protein expressed in epithelial cells, is a key transcriptional regulator of cell adhesion program and functions as a critical metastasis suppressor. It has been documented that the expression of DeltaNp63alpha is tightly controlled by oncogenic signaling and is frequently reduced in advanced cancers. However, whether TGF-beta signaling regulates DeltaNp63alpha expression in promoting metastasis is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of TGF-beta signaling leads to stabilization of E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO3, which, in turn, targets DeltaNp63alpha for proteasomal degradation in a Smad-independent but Erk-dependent manner. Knockdown of FBXO3 or restoration of DeltaNp63alpha expression effectively rescues TGF-beta-induced EMT, cell motility, and tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clinical analyses reveal a significant correlation among TGF-beta receptor I (TbetaRI), FBXO3, and p63 protein expression and that high expression of TbetaRI/FBXO3 and low expression of p63 are associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Together, these results demonstrate that FBXO3 facilitates DeltaNp63alpha degradation to empower TGF-beta signaling in promoting tumor metastasis and that the TbetaRI-FBXO3-DeltaNp63alpha axis is critically important in breast cancer development and clinical prognosis. This study suggests that FBXO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.	Noncanonical TGF-beta signaling leads to FBXO3-mediated degradation of DeltaNp63alpha promoting breast cancer metastasis and poor clinical prognosis.	PLoS biology
33684096	The function of Sprouty2 (Spry2) in T cells is unknown. Using 2 different (inducible and T cell-targeted) knockout mouse strains, we found that Spry2 positively regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling by modulating the activity of LCK. Spry2-/- CD4+ T cells were unable to activate LCK, proliferate, differentiate into T helper cells, or produce cytokines. Spry2 deficiency abrogated type 2 inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in a murine model of asthma. Spry2 expression was higher in blood and airway CD4+ T cells from patients with asthma, and Spry2 knockdown impaired human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Spry2 deficiency up-regulated the lipid raft protein caveolin-1, enhanced its interaction with CSK, and increased CSK interaction with LCK, culminating in augmented inhibitory phosphorylation of LCK. Knockdown of CSK or dislodgment of caveolin-1-bound CSK restored ERK1/2 activation in Spry2-/- T cells, suggesting an essential role for Spry2 in LCK activation and T cell function.	Sprouty2 positively regulates T cell function and airway inflammation through regulation of CSK and LCK kinases.	PLoS biology
33705388	The regulation of protein synthesis is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially during stress responses, and its dysregulation could underlie the development of human diseases. The critical step during translation regulation is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha). Here we report the identification of a direct kinase of eIF2alpha, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), which phosphorylates eIF2alpha in response to proteotoxic stress. The activity of MARK2 was confirmed in the cells lacking the 4 previously known eIF2alpha kinases. MARK2 itself was found to be a substrate of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), which serves as a sensor for protein misfolding stress through a dynamic interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Both MARK2 and PKCdelta are activated via phosphorylation in proteotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative mouse models and in human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These results reveal a PKCdelta-MARK2-eIF2alpha cascade that may play a critical role in cellular proteotoxic stress responses and human diseases.

33657094	Mutations in mitochondrial replicative polymerase PolgammaA lead to progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). While PolgammaA is the known central player in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, it is unknown whether a regulatory process exists on the mitochondrial outer membrane which controlled its entry into the mitochondria. We now demonstrate that PolgammaA is ubiquitylated by mitochondrial E3 ligase, MITOL (or MARCH5, RNF153). Ubiquitylation in wild-type (WT) PolgammaA occurs at Lysine 1060 residue via K6 linkage. Ubiquitylation of PolgammaA negatively regulates its binding to Tom20 and thereby its mitochondrial entry. While screening different PEO patients for mitochondrial entry, we found that a subset of the PolgammaA mutants is hyperubiquitylated by MITOL and interact less with Tom20. These PolgammaA variants cannot enter into mitochondria, instead becomes enriched in the insoluble fraction and undergo enhanced degradation. Hence, mtDNA replication, as observed via BrdU incorporation into the mtDNA, was compromised in these PEO mutants. However, by manipulating their ubiquitylation status by 2 independent techniques, these PEO mutants were reactivated, which allowed the incorporation of BrdU into mtDNA. Thus, regulated entry of non-ubiquitylated PolgammaA may have beneficial consequences for certain PEO patients.	MITOL-dependent ubiquitylation negatively regulates the entry of PolgammaA into mitochondria.	PLoS biology
32324216	Resistance to androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapeutics in prostate cancer (PC) is a significant clinical problem. Mechanisms by which this is accomplished include AR amplification and expression of AR splice variants, demonstrating that AR remains a key therapeutic target in advanced disease. For the first time we show that IKBKE drives AR signalling in advanced PC. Significant inhibition of AR regulated gene expression was observed upon siRNA-mediated IKBKE depletion or pharmacological inhibition due to inhibited AR gene expression in multiple cell line models including a LNCaP derivative cell line resistant to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (LNCaP-EnzR). Phenotypically, this resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation, migration and colony forming ability suggesting that targeting IKBKE could circumvent resistance to AR targeting therapies. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition in the CWR22Rv1 xenograft mouse model reduced tumour size and enhanced survival. Critically, this was validated in patient-derived explants where enzymatic inactivation of IKBKE reduced cell proliferation and AR expression. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that IKBKE regulates AR levels via Hippo pathway inhibition to reduce c-MYC levels at cis-regulatory elements within the AR gene. Thus, IKBKE is a therapeutic target in advanced PC suggesting repurposing of clinically tested IKBKE inhibitors could be beneficial to castrate resistant PC patients.	IKBKE activity enhances AR levels in advanced prostate cancer via modulation of the Hippo pathway.	Nucleic acids research
32338744	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) frequently regulate the expression of other RBPs in mammalian cells. Such cross-regulation has been proposed to be important to control networks of coordinated gene expression; however, much remains to be understood about how such networks of cross-regulation are established and what the functional consequence is of coordinated or reciprocal expression of RBPs. Here we demonstrate that the RBPs CELF2 and hnRNP C regulate the expression of each other, such that depletion of one results in reduced expression of the other. Specifically, we show that loss of hnRNP C reduces the transcription of CELF2 mRNA, while loss of CELF2 results in decreased efficiency of hnRNP C translation. We further demonstrate that this reciprocal regulation serves to fine tune the splicing patterns of many downstream target genes. Together, this work reveals new activities of hnRNP C and CELF2, provides insight into a previously unrecognized gene regulatory network, and demonstrates how cross-regulation of RBPs functions to shape the cellular transcriptome.	Reciprocal regulation of hnRNP C and CELF2 through translation and transcription tunes splicing activity in T cells.	Nucleic acids research
32399566	Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are coupled to promote gene expression and regulation. However, mechanisms by which transcription and splicing influence each other are still under investigation. The ATPase Prp5p is required for pre-spliceosome assembly and splicing proofreading at the branch-point region. From an open UV mutagenesis screen for genetic suppressors of prp5 defects and subsequent targeted testing, we identify components of the TBP-binding module of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, Spt8p and Spt3p. Spt8Delta and spt3Delta rescue the cold-sensitivity of prp5-GAR allele, and prp5 mutants restore growth of spt8Delta and spt3Delta strains on 6-azauracil. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that prp5 alleles decrease recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to an intron-containing gene, which is rescued by spt8Delta. Further ChIP-seq reveals that global effects on Pol II-binding are mutually rescued by prp5-GAR and spt8Delta. Inhibited splicing caused by prp5-GAR is also restored by spt8Delta. In vitro assays indicate that Prp5p directly interacts with Spt8p, but not Spt3p. We demonstrate that Prp5p's splicing proofreading is modulated by Spt8p and Spt3p. Therefore, this study reveals that interactions between the TBP-binding module of SAGA and the spliceosomal ATPase Prp5p mediate a balance between transcription initiation/elongation and pre-spliceosome assembly.	Prp5-Spt8/Spt3 interaction mediates a reciprocal coupling between splicing and transcription.	Nucleic acids research
32421830	Originally identified as an RNA polymerase II interactor, Che-1/AATF (Che-1) has now been recognized as a multifunctional protein involved in cell-cycle regulation and cancer progression, as well as apoptosis inhibition and response to stress. This protein displays a peculiar nucleolar localization and it has recently been implicated in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a novel function of Che-1 in the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, in both cancer and normal cells. We demonstrate that Che-1 interacts with RNA polymerase I and nucleolar upstream binding factor (UBF) and promotes RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. Furthermore, this protein binds to the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and modulates its epigenetic state by contrasting the recruitment of HDAC1. Che-1 downregulation affects RNA polymerase I and UBF recruitment on rDNA and leads to reducing rDNA promoter activity and 47S pre-rRNA production. Interestingly, Che-1 depletion induces abnormal nucleolar morphology associated with re-distribution of nucleolar proteins. Finally, we show that upon DNA damage Che-1 re-localizes from rDNA to TP53 gene promoter to induce cell-cycle arrest. This previously uncharacterized function of Che-1 confirms the important role of this protein in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation and response to stress.	Che-1/AATF binds to RNA polymerase I machinery and sustains ribosomal RNA gene transcription.	Nucleic acids research
32374842	We have previously found that UV-induced DNA damage causes hyperphosphorylation of the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), inhibition of transcriptional elongation and changes in alternative splicing (AS) due to kinetic coupling between transcription and splicing. In an unbiased search for protein kinases involved in the AS response to DNA damage, we have identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) as an unforeseen participant. Unlike Cdk9 inhibition, GSK-3 inhibition only prevents CTD hyperphosphorylation triggered by UV but not basal phosphorylation. This effect is not due to differential degradation of the phospho-CTD isoforms and can be reproduced, at the AS level, by overexpression of a kinase-dead GSK-3 dominant negative mutant. GSK-3 inhibition abrogates both the reduction in RNAPII elongation and changes in AS elicited by UV. We show that GSK-3 phosphorylates the CTD in vitro, but preferentially when the substrate is previously phosphorylated, consistently with the requirement of a priming phosphorylation reported for GSK-3 efficacy. In line with a role for GSK-3 in the response to DNA damage, GSK-3 inhibition prevents UV-induced apoptosis. In summary, we uncover a novel role for a widely studied kinase in key steps of eukaryotic transcription and pre-mRNA processing.	GSK-3 is an RNA polymerase II phospho-CTD kinase.

32402080	The DNA damage checkpoint halts cell cycle progression in G2 in response to genotoxic insults. Central to the execution of cell cycle arrest is the checkpoint-induced stabilization of securin-separase complex (yeast Pds1-Esp1). The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (yeast Chk1 and Rad53) are thought to critically contribute to the stability of securin-separase complex by phosphorylation of securin, rendering it resistant to proteolytic destruction by the anaphase promoting complex (APC). Dun1, a Rad53 paralog related to Chk2, is also essential for checkpoint-imposed arrest. Dun1 is required for the DNA damage-induced transcription of DNA repair genes; however, its role in the execution of cell cycle arrest remains unknown. Here, we show that Dun1's role in checkpoint arrest is independent of its involvement in the transcription of repair genes. Instead, Dun1 is necessary to prevent Pds1 destruction during DNA damage in that the Dun1-deficient cells degrade Pds1, escape G2 arrest and undergo mitosis despite the presence of checkpoint-active Chk1 and Rad53. Interestingly, proteolytic degradation of Pds1 in the absence of Dun1 is mediated not by APC but by the HECT domain-containing E3 ligase Rsp5. Our results suggest a regulatory scheme in which Dun1 prevents chromosome segregation during DNA damage by inhibiting Rsp5-mediated proteolytic degradation of securin Pds1.	Dun1, a Chk2-related kinase, is the central regulator of securin-separase dynamics during DNA damage signaling.	Nucleic acids research
32396167	P-bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic mRNA-protein (mRNP) granules conserved throughout eukaryotes which are implicated in the repression, storage and degradation of mRNAs. PB assembly is driven by proteins with self-interacting and low-complexity domains. Non-translating mRNA also stimulates PB assembly, however no studies to date have explored whether particular mRNA transcripts are more critical than others in facilitating PB assembly. Previous work revealed that rps28bDelta (small ribosomal subunit-28B) mutants do not form PBs under normal growth conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the RPS28B 3'UTR is important for PB assembly, consistent with it harboring a binding site for the PB assembly protein Edc3. However, expression of the RPS28B 3'UTR alone is insufficient to drive PB assembly. Intriguingly, chimeric mRNA studies revealed that Rps28 protein, translated in cis from an mRNA bearing the RPS28B 3'UTR, physically interacts more strongly with Edc3 than Rps28 protein synthesized in trans. This Edc3-Rps28 interaction in turn facilitates PB assembly. Our work indicates that PB assembly may be nucleated by specific RNA 'scaffolds'. Furthermore, this is the first description in yeast to our knowledge of a cis-translated protein interacting with another protein in the 3'UTR of the mRNA which encoded it, which in turn stimulates assembly of cellular structures.	RPS28B mRNA acts as a scaffold promoting cis-translational interaction of proteins driving P-body assembly.	Nucleic acids research
32383752	API5 (APoptosis Inhibitor 5) and nuclear FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) are upregulated in various human cancers and are correlated with poor prognosis. Although their physical interaction has been identified, the function related to the resulting complex is unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the API5-FGF2 complex and identified critical residues driving the protein interaction. These findings provided a structural basis for the nuclear localization of the FGF2 isoform lacking a canonical nuclear localization signal and identified a cryptic nuclear localization sequence in FGF2. The interaction between API5 and FGF2 was important for mRNA nuclear export through both the TREX and eIF4E/LRPPRC mRNA export complexes, thus regulating the export of bulk mRNA and specific mRNAs containing eIF4E sensitivity elements, such as c-MYC and cyclin D1. These data show the newly identified molecular function of API5 and nuclear FGF2, and provide a clue to understanding the dynamic regulation of mRNA export.

32396195	Most eukaryotic mRNAs harbor a characteristic 5' m7GpppN cap that promotes pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation while also protecting mRNAs from exonucleolytic attacks. mRNA caps are eliminated by Dcp2 during mRNA decay, allowing 5'-3' exonucleases to degrade mRNA bodies. However, the Dcp2 decapping enzyme is poorly active on its own and requires binding to stable or transient protein partners to sever the cap of target mRNAs. Here, we analyse the role of one of these partners, the yeast Pby1 factor, which is known to co-localize into P-bodies together with decapping factors. We report that Pby1 uses its C-terminal domain to directly bind to the decapping enzyme. We solved the structure of this Pby1 domain alone and bound to the Dcp1-Dcp2-Edc3 decapping complex. Structure-based mutant analyses reveal that Pby1 binding to the decapping enzyme is required for its recruitment into P-bodies. Moreover, Pby1 binding to the decapping enzyme stimulates growth in conditions in which decapping activation is compromised. Our results point towards a direct connection of Pby1 with decapping and P-body formation, both stemming from its interaction with the Dcp1-Dcp2 holoenzyme.	Pby1 is a direct partner of the Dcp2 decapping enzyme.	Nucleic acids research
32432680	OGG1 initiated base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for repair of oxidative DNA base damage 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Here, we report that RECQL4 DNA helicase, deficient in the cancer-prone and premature aging Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, physically and functionally interacts with OGG1. RECQL4 promotes catalytic activity of OGG1 and RECQL4 deficiency results in defective 8-oxoG repair and increased genomic 8-oxoG. Furthermore, we show that acute oxidative stress leads to increased RECQL4 acetylation and its interaction with OGG1. The NAD+-dependent protein SIRT1 deacetylates RECQL4 in vitro and in cells thereby controlling the interaction between OGG1 and RECQL4 after DNA repair and maintaining RECQL4 in a low acetylated state. Collectively, we find that RECQL4 is involved in 8-oxoG repair through interaction with OGG1, and that SIRT1 indirectly modulates BER of 8-oxoG by controlling RECQL4-OGG1 interaction.	Interaction between RECQL4 and OGG1 promotes repair of oxidative base lesion 8-oxoG and is regulated by SIRT1 deacetylase.	Nucleic acids research
32459350	Functional crosstalk between histone modifications and chromatin remodeling has emerged as a key regulatory mode of transcriptional control during cell fate decisions, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we discover an HRP2-DPF3a-BAF epigenetic pathway that coordinates methylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling to regulate chromatin dynamics and gene transcription during myogenic differentiation. Using siRNA screening targeting epigenetic modifiers, we identify hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP2) as a key regulator of myogenesis. Knockout of HRP2 in mice leads to impaired muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, through its HIV integrase binding domain (IBD), HRP2 associates with the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex by interacting directly with the BAF45c (DPF3a) subunit. Through its Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain, HRP2 preferentially binds to H3K36me2. Consistent with the biochemical studies, ChIP-seq analyses show that HRP2 colocalizes with DPF3a across the genome and that the recruitment of HRP2/DPF3a to chromatin is dependent on H3K36me2. Integrative transcriptomic and cistromic analyses, coupled with ATAC-seq, reveal that HRP2 and DPF3a activate myogenic genes by increasing chromatin accessibility through recruitment of BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the BAF complex. Taken together, these results illuminate a key role for the HRP2-DPF3a-BAF complex in the epigenetic coordination of gene transcription during myogenic differentiation.	HRP2-DPF3a-BAF complex coordinates histone modification and chromatin remodeling to regulate myogenic gene transcription.	Nucleic acids research
32479628	The nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear structure that disassembles when cells undergo mitosis. During mitosis, nucleolar factors are thus released from the nucleolus and dynamically change their subcellular localization; however, their functions remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we found that a nucleolar factor called nucleolar protein 11 (NOL11) forms a protein complex with two tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat proteins named WD-repeat protein 43 (WDR43) and Cirhin in mitotic cells. This complex, referred to here as the NWC (NOL11-WDR43-Cirhin) complex, exists in nucleoli during interphase and translocates to the periphery of mitotic chromosomes, i.e., perichromosomal regions. During mitotic progression, both the congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and sister chromatid cohesion are impaired in the absence of the NWC complex, as it is required for the centromeric enrichment of Aurora B and the associating phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3. These results reveal the characteristics of a novel protein complex consisting of nucleolar proteins, which is required for regulating kinetochores and centromeres to ensure faithful chromosome segregation.

32449921	Mitoribosome biogenesis is an expensive metabolic process that is essential to maintain cellular respiratory capacity and requires the stoichiometric accumulation of rRNAs and proteins encoded in two distinct genomes. In yeast, the ribosomal protein Var1, alias uS3m, is mitochondrion-encoded. uS3m is a protein universally present in all ribosomes, where it forms part of the small subunit (SSU) mRNA entry channel and plays a pivotal role in ribosome loading onto the mRNA. However, despite its critical functional role, very little is known concerning VAR1 gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the protein Sov1 is an in bona fide VAR1 mRNA translational activator and additionally interacts with newly synthesized Var1 polypeptide. Moreover, we show that Sov1 assists the late steps of mtSSU biogenesis involving the incorporation of Var1, an event necessary for uS14 and mS46 assembly. Notably, we have uncovered a translational regulatory mechanism by which Sov1 fine-tunes Var1 synthesis with its assembly into the mitoribosome.	The translational activator Sov1 coordinates mitochondrial gene expression with mitoribosome biogenesis.	Nucleic acids research
32453417	Cell growth requires a high level of protein synthesis and oncogenic pathways stimulate cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis. Less is known about how cells respond to dysfunctional mRNA translation and how this feeds back into growth regulatory pathways. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EBNA1 causes mRNA translation stress in cis that activates PI3Kdelta. This leads to the stabilization of MDM2, induces MDM2's binding to the E2F1 mRNA and promotes E2F1 translation. The MDM2 serine 166 regulates the interaction with the E2F1 mRNA and deletion of MDM2 C-terminal RING domain results in a constitutive E2F1 mRNA binding. Phosphorylation on serine 395 following DNA damage instead regulates p53 mRNA binding to its RING domain and prevents the E2F1 mRNA interaction. The p14Arf tumour suppressor binds MDM2 and in addition to preventing degradation of the p53 protein it also prevents the E2F1 mRNA interaction. The data illustrate how two MDM2 domains selectively bind specific mRNAs in response to cellular conditions to promote, or suppress, cell growth and how p14Arf coordinates MDM2's activity towards p53 and E2F1. The data also show how EBV via EBNA1-induced mRNA translation stress targets the E2F1 and the MDM2 - p53 pathway.	MDM2's dual mRNA binding domains co-ordinate its oncogenic and tumour suppressor activities.	Nucleic acids research
32449937	SERRATE/ARS2 is a conserved RNA effector protein involved in transcription, processing and export of different types of RNAs. In Arabidopsis, the best-studied function of SERRATE (SE) is to promote miRNA processing. Here, we report that SE interacts with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, comprising the RNA helicase HEN2, the RNA binding protein RBM7 and one of the two zinc-knuckle proteins ZCCHC8A/ZCCHC8B. The identification of common targets of SE and HEN2 by RNA-seq supports the idea that SE cooperates with NEXT for RNA surveillance by the nuclear exosome. Among the RNA targets accumulating in absence of SE or NEXT are miRNA precursors. Loss of NEXT components results in the accumulation of pri-miRNAs without affecting levels of miRNAs, indicating that NEXT is, unlike SE, not required for miRNA processing. As compared to se-2, se-2 hen2-2 double mutants showed increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs, but partially restored levels of mature miRNAs and attenuated developmental defects. We propose that the slow degradation of pri-miRNAs caused by loss of HEN2 compensates for the poor miRNA processing efficiency in se-2 mutants, and that SE regulates miRNA biogenesis through its double contribution in promoting miRNA processing but also pri-miRNA degradation through the recruitment of the NEXT complex.	SERRATE interacts with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex to degrade primary miRNA precursors in Arabidopsis.	Nucleic acids research
32544250	The modulation of GLI2, an oncogenic transcription factor commonly upregulated in cancer, is in many cases not due to genetic defects, suggesting dysregulation through alternative mechanisms. The identity of these molecular events remains for the most part unknown. Here, we identified TFII-I as a novel repressor of GLI2 expression. Mapping experiments suggest that the INR region of the GLI2 promoter is necessary for GLI2 repression. ChIP studies showed that TFII-I binds to this INR. TFII-I knockdown decreased the binding of NELF-A, a component of the promoter-proximal pausing complex at this site, and enriched phosphorylated RNAPII serine 2 in the GLI2 gene body. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate TFII-I interaction with SPT5, another pausing complex component. TFII-I overexpression antagonized GLI2 induction by TGFbeta, a known activator of GLI2 in cancer cells. TGFbeta reduced endogenous TFII-I binding to the INR and increased RNAPII SerP2 in the gene body. We demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism is not exclusive of GLI2. TGFbeta-induced genes CCR7, TGFbeta1 and EGR3 showed similar decreased TFII-I and NELF-A INR binding and increased RNAPII SerP2 in the gene body post-TGFbeta treatment. Together these results identify TFII-I as a novel repressor of a subset of TGFbeta-responsive genes through the regulation of RNAPII pausing.	TFII-I-mediated polymerase pausing antagonizes GLI2 induction by TGFbeta.	Nucleic acids research
32542338	R-loops are formed when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional machinery and can cause genomic instability. However, it is unclear how R-loops are regulated at transcription-replication conflict (TRC) sites and how replisome proteins are regulated to prevent R-loop formation or mediate R-loop tolerance. Here, we report that ATAD5, a PCNA unloader, plays dual functions to reduce R-loops both under normal and replication stress conditions. ATAD5 interacts with RNA helicases such as DDX1, DDX5, DDX21 and DHX9 and increases the abundance of these helicases at replication forks to facilitate R-loop resolution. Depletion of ATAD5 or ATAD5-interacting RNA helicases consistently increases R-loops during the S phase and reduces the replication rate, both of which are enhanced by replication stress. In addition to R-loop resolution, ATAD5 prevents the generation of new R-loops behind the replication forks by unloading PCNA which, otherwise, accumulates and persists on DNA, causing a collision with the transcription machinery. Depletion of ATAD5 reduces transcription rates due to PCNA accumulation. Consistent with the role of ATAD5 and RNA helicases in maintaining genomic integrity by regulating R-loops, the corresponding genes were mutated or downregulated in several human tumors.	ATAD5 restricts R-loop formation through PCNA unloading and RNA helicase maintenance at the replication fork.	Nucleic acids research
32652011	Biogenesis of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) involves several conserved small GTPases. Here, we report that the Obg family protein GTPBP5 or MTG2 is a mitochondrial protein whose absence in a TALEN-induced HEK293T knockout (KO) cell line leads to severely decreased levels of the 55S monosome and attenuated mitochondrial protein synthesis. We show that a fraction of GTPBP5 co-sediments with the large mitoribosome subunit (mtLSU), and crosslinks specifically with the 16S rRNA, and several mtLSU proteins and assembly factors. Notably, the latter group includes MTERF4, involved in monosome assembly, and MRM2, the methyltransferase that catalyzes the modification of the 16S mt-rRNA A-loop U1369 residue. The GTPBP5 interaction with MRM2 was also detected using the proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) assay. In GTPBP5-KO mitochondria, the mtLSU lacks bL36m, accumulates an excess of the assembly factors MTG1, GTPBP10, MALSU1 and MTERF4, and contains hypomethylated 16S rRNA. We propose that GTPBP5 primarily fuels proper mtLSU maturation by securing efficient methylation of two 16S rRNA residues, and ultimately serves to coordinate subunit joining through the release of late-stage mtLSU assembly factors. In this way, GTPBP5 provides an ultimate quality control checkpoint function during mtLSU assembly that minimizes premature subunit joining to ensure the assembly of the mature 55S monosome.	Human GTPBP5 (MTG2) fuels mitoribosome large subunit maturation by facilitating 16S rRNA methylation.	Nucleic acids research
32667666	Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that control approximately 24-hour physiology and behaviors in virtually all organisms. The circadian oscillator comprises interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops, but also requires finely coordinated protein homeostasis including protein degradation and maturation. However, the mechanisms underlying the mammalian clock protein maturation is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that necdin, one of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)-causative genes, is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the pacemaker of circadian clocks in mammals. Mice deficient in necdin show abnormal behaviors during an 8-hour advance jet-lag paradigm and disrupted clock gene expression in the liver. By using yeast two hybrid screening, we identified BMAL1, the core component of the circadian clock, and co-chaperone SGT1 as two necdin-interactive proteins. BMAL1 and SGT1 associated with the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of necdin, respectively. Mechanistically, necdin enables SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery to stabilize BMAL1. Depletion of necdin or SGT1/HSP90 leads to degradation of BMAL1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in alterations in both clock gene expression and circadian rhythms. Taken together, our data identify the PWS-associated protein necdin as a novel regulator of the circadian clock, and further emphasize the critical roles of chaperone machinery in circadian clock regulation.	Necdin regulates BMAL1 stability and circadian clock through SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery.	Nucleic acids research
32619236	Coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and ribosomal protein gene (RPG) transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RNAP) is a key requirement for growth control. Although evidence for balance between RNPI-dependent 35S rRNA production and RNAPII-mediated RPG transcription have been described, the molecular basis is still obscure. Here, we found that Rph1 modulates the transcription status of both rRNAs and RPGs in yeast. We show that Rph1 widely associates with RNAPI and RNAPII-transcribed genes. Deletion of RPH1 remarkably alleviates cell slow growth caused by TORC1 inhibition via derepression of rRNA and RPG transcription under nutrient stress conditions. Mechanistically, Rim15 kinase phosphorylates Rph1 upon rapamycin treatment. Phosphorylation-mimetic mutant of Rph1 exhibited more resistance to rapamycin treatment, decreased association with ribosome-related genes, and faster cell growth compared to the wild-type, indicating that Rph1 dissociation from chromatin ensures cell survival upon nutrient stress. Our results uncover the role of Rph1 in coordination of RNA polymerases-mediated transcription to control cell growth under nutrient stress conditions.

32761127	The IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a non-catalytic post-transcriptional enhancer of tumor growth upregulated and associated with adverse prognosis in solid cancers. However, conserved effector pathway(s) and the feasibility of targeting IGF2BP1 in cancer remained elusive. We reveal that IGF2BP1 is a post-transcriptional enhancer of the E2F-driven hallmark in solid cancers. IGF2BP1 promotes G1/S cell cycle transition by stabilizing mRNAs encoding positive regulators of this checkpoint like E2F1. This IGF2BP1-driven shortening of the G1 cell cycle phase relies on 3'UTR-, miRNA- and m6A-dependent regulation and suggests enhancement of cell cycle progression by m6A-modifications across cancers. In addition to E2F transcription factors, IGF2BP1 also stabilizes E2F-driven transcripts directly indicating post-transcriptional 'super'-enhancer role of the protein in E2F-driven gene expression in cancer. The small molecule BTYNB disrupts this enhancer function by impairing IGF2BP1-RNA association. Consistently, BTYNB interferes with E2F-driven gene expression and tumor growth in experimental mouse tumor models.	The oncofetal RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 is a druggable, post-transcriptional super-enhancer of E2F-driven gene expression in cancer.	Nucleic acids research
32692361	The differentiation and regeneration of skeletal muscle from myoblasts to myotubes involves myogenic transcription factors, such as myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) and serum response factor (SRF). In addition, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is required during myogenesis. Here, we provide evidence for novel mechanisms regulating MRTF-A during myogenic differentiation. Endogenous MRTF-A protein abundance and activity decreased during C2C12 differentiation, which was attributable to miRNA-directed inhibition. Conversely, overexpression of MRTF-A impaired differentiation and myosin expression. Applying miRNA trapping by RNA affinity purification (miTRAP), we identified miRNAs which directly regulate MRTF-A via its 3'UTR, including miR-1a-3p, miR-206-3p, miR-24-3p and miR-486-5p. These miRNAs were upregulated during differentiation and specifically recruited to the 3'UTR of MRTF-A. Concomitantly, Ago2 recruitment to the MRTF-A 3'UTR was considerably increased, whereas Dicer1 depletion or 3'UTR deletion elevated MRTF-A and inhibited differentiation. MRTF-A protein expression was inhibited by ectopic miRNA expression in murine C2C12 and primary human myoblasts. 3'UTR reporter activity diminished upon differentiation or miRNA expression, whereas deletion of the predicted binding sites reversed these effects. Furthermore, TGF-beta abolished MRTF-A reduction and decreased miR-486-5p expression. Our findings implicate miR-24-3p and miR-486-5p in the repression of MRTF-A and suggest a complex network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating myogenesis.

32735658	Epigenetic regulation is important for establishing lineage-specific gene expression during early development. Although signaling pathways have been well-studied for regulation of trophectoderm reprogramming, epigenetic regulation of trophectodermal genes with histone modification dynamics have been poorly understood. Here, we identify that plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) is a key epigenetic regulator for activation of trophectodermal genes using RNA-sequencing and ChIP assays. PHF6 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination of H2BK120 (H2BK120ub) via its extended plant homeodomain 1 (PHD1), while the extended PHD2 of PHF6 recognizes acetylation of H2BK12 (H2BK12Ac). Intriguingly, the recognition of H2BK12Ac by PHF6 is important for exerting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for H2BK120ub. Together, our data provide evidence that PHF6 is crucial for epigenetic regulation of trophectodermal gene expression by linking H2BK12Ac to H2BK120ub modification.	The chromatin-binding protein PHF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of H2BK120 via H2BK12Ac recognition for activation of trophectodermal genes.	Nucleic acids research
32729622	Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a well-characterized transcription factor that protects cells against oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Emerging evidence has suggested that NRF2 protects cells against DNA damage by mechanisms other than antioxidation, yet the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that knockout of NRF2 in cells results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) in the presence or absence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under ROS scavenging conditions, induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) increases the NRF2 protein level and recruits NRF2 to DNA damage sites where it interacts with ATR, resulting in activation of the ATR-CHK1-CDC2 signaling pathway. In turn, this leads to G2 cell cycle arrest and the promotion of homologous recombination repair of DSBs, thereby preserving genome stability. The inhibition of NRF2 by brusatol increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in xenografts by perturbing ATR and CHK1 activation. Collectively, our results reveal a novel function of NRF2 as an ATR activator in the regulation of the cellular response to DSBs. This shift in perspective should help furnish a more complete understanding of the function of NRF2 and the DNA damage response.	NRF2 preserves genomic integrity by facilitating ATR activation and G2 cell cycle arrest.	Nucleic acids research
32735676	Microcephalin 1 (MCPH1) was identified from genetic mutations in patients with primary autosomal recessive microcephaly. In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), MCPH1 forms damage-induced foci and recruits BRCA2-RAD51 complex, a key component of the DSB repair machinery for homologous recombination (HR), to damage sites. Accordingly, the efficiency of HR is significantly attenuated upon depletion of MCPH1. The biochemical characteristics of MCPH1 and its functional interaction with the HR machinery had remained unclear due to lack of highly purified MCPH1 recombinant protein for functional study. Here, we established a mammalian expression system to express and purify MCPH1 protein. We show that MCPH1 is a bona fide DNA-binding protein and provide direct biochemical analysis of this MCPH family protein. Furthermore, we reveal that MCPH1 directly interacts with RAD51 at multiple contact points, providing evidence for how MCPH1 physically engages with the HR machinery. Importantly, we demonstrate that MCPH1 enhances the stability of RAD51 on single-strand DNA, a prerequisite step for RAD51-mediated recombination. Single-molecule tethered particle motion analysis showed a approximately 2-fold increase in the lifetime of RAD51-ssDNA filaments in the presence of MCPH1. Thus, our study demonstrates direct crosstalk between microcephaly protein MCPH1 and the recombination component RAD51 for DSB repair.	Microcephaly family protein MCPH1 stabilizes RAD51 filaments.

32789493	The NAD+-dependent deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase SIRT6 stabilizes the genome by promoting DNA double strand break repair, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor. However, whether SIRT6 regulates nucleotide excision repair (NER) remains unknown. Here, we showed that SIRT6 was recruited to sites of UV-induced DNA damage and stimulated the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Mechanistic studies further indicated that SIRT6 interacted with DDB2, the major sensor initiating global genome NER (GG-NER), and that the interaction was enhanced upon UV irradiation. SIRT6 deacetylated DDB2 at two lysine residues, K35 and K77, upon UV stress and then promoted DDB2 ubiquitination and segregation from chromatin, thereby facilitating downstream signaling. In addition, we characterized several SIRT6 mutations derived from melanoma patients. These SIRT6 mutants ablated the stimulatory effect of SIRT6 on NER and destabilized the genome due to (i) partial loss of enzymatic activity (P27S or H50Y), (ii) a nonsense mutation (R150*) or (iii) high turnover rates (G134W). Overall, we demonstrate that SIRT6 promotes NER by deacetylating DDB2, thereby preventing the onset of melanomagenesis.	The deacetylase SIRT6 promotes the repair of UV-induced DNA damage by targeting DDB2.	Nucleic acids research
32813009	N 6-methylation of 2'-O-methyladenosine (Am) in RNA occurs in eukaryotic cells to generate N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Identification of the methyltransferase responsible for m6Am catalysis has accelerated studies on the function of m6Am in RNA processing. While m6Am is generally found in the first transcribed nucleotide of mRNAs, the modification is also found internally within U2 snRNA. However, the writer required for catalyzing internal m6Am formation had remained elusive. By sequencing transcriptome-wide RNA methylation at single-base-resolution, we identified human METTL4 as the writer that directly methylates Am at U2 snRNA position 30 into m6Am. We found that METTL4 localizes to the nucleus and its conserved methyltransferase catalytic site is required for U2 snRNA methylation. By sequencing human cells with overexpressed Mettl4, we determined METTL4's in vivo target RNA motif specificity. In the absence of Mettl4 in human cells, U2 snRNA lacks m6Am thereby affecting a subset of splicing events that exhibit specific features such as 3' splice-site weakness and an increase in exon inclusion. These findings suggest that METTL4 methylation of U2 snRNA regulates splicing of specific pre-mRNA transcripts.	METTL4 catalyzes m6Am methylation in U2 snRNA to regulate pre-mRNA splicing.

32960271	The nuclear Cap-Binding Complex (CBC), consisting of Nuclear Cap-Binding Protein 1 (NCBP1) and 2 (NCBP2), associates with the nascent 5'cap of RNA polymerase II transcripts and impacts RNA fate decisions. Recently, the C17orf85 protein, also called NCBP3, was suggested to form an alternative CBC by replacing NCBP2. However, applying protein-protein interaction screening of NCBP1, 2 and 3, we find that the interaction profile of NCBP3 is distinct. Whereas NCBP1 and 2 identify known CBC interactors, NCBP3 primarily interacts with components of the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) and the TRanscription and EXport (TREX) complex. NCBP3-EJC association in vitro and in vivo requires EJC core integrity and the in vivo RNA binding profiles of EJC and NCBP3 overlap. We further show that NCBP3 competes with the RNA degradation factor ZC3H18 for binding CBC-bound transcripts, and that NCBP3 positively impacts the nuclear export of polyadenylated RNAs and the expression of large multi-exonic transcripts. Collectively, our results place NCBP3 with the EJC and TREX complexes in supporting mRNA expression.	NCBP3 positively impacts mRNA biogenesis.	Nucleic acids research
33010171	NBS1 is a critical component of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex, which regulates ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Mutations in NBS1 cause the human genomic instability syndrome Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), of which neuronal deficits, including microcephaly and intellectual disability, are classical hallmarks. Given its function in the DDR to ensure proper proliferation and prevent death of replicating cells, NBS1 is essential for life. Here we show that, unexpectedly, Nbs1 deletion is dispensable for postmitotic neurons, but compromises their arborization and migration due to dysregulated Notch signaling. We find that Nbs1 interacts with NICD-RBPJ, the effector of Notch signaling, and inhibits Notch activity. Genetic ablation or pharmaceutical inhibition of Notch signaling rescues the maturation and migration defects of Nbs1-deficient neurons in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of Notch by Nbs1 deletion is independent of the key DDR downstream effector p53 and inactivation of each MRN component produces a different pattern of Notch activity and distinct neuronal defects. These data indicate that neuronal defects and aberrant Notch activity in Nbs1-deficient cells are unlikely to be a direct consequence of loss of MRN-mediated DDR function. This study discloses a novel function of NBS1 in crosstalk with the Notch pathway in neuron development.	NBS1 interacts with Notch signaling in neuronal homeostasis.	Nucleic acids research
33010150	ATR functions as a master regulator of the DNA-damage response. ATR activation requires the ATR activator, topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1 (TopBP1). However, the underlying mechanism of TopBP1 regulation and how its regulation affects DNA replication remain unknown. Here, we report a specific interaction between TopBP1 and the histone demethylase PHF8. The TopBP1/PHF8 interaction is mediated by the BRCT 7+8 domain of TopBP1 and phosphorylation of PHF8 at Ser854. This interaction is cell-cycle regulated and phosphorylation-dependent. PHF8 is phosphorylated by CK2, which regulates binding of PHF8 to TopBP1. Importantly, PHF8 regulates TopBP1 protein level by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the E3 ligase UBR5. Interestingly, PHF8pS854 is likely to contribute to regulation of TopBP1 stability and DNA replication checkpoint. Further, both TopBP1 and PHF8 are required for efficient replication fork restart. Together, these data identify PHF8 as a TopBP1-binding protein and provide mechanistic insight into how PHF8 regulates TopBP1 stability to maintain DNA replication.	CK2 kinase-mediated PHF8 phosphorylation controls TopBP1 stability to regulate DNA replication.	Nucleic acids research
33205822	IRF3 and IRF7 are critical transcription factors in the innate immune response. Their activation is controlled by phosphorylation events, leading to the formation of homodimers that are transcriptionally active. Phosphorylation occurs when IRF3 is recruited to adaptor proteins via a positively charged surface within the regulatory domain of IRF3. This positively charged surface also plays a crucial role in forming the active homodimer by interacting with the phosphorylated sites stabilizing the homodimer. Here, we describe a distinct molecular interaction that is responsible for adaptor docking and hence phosphorylation as well as a separate interaction responsible for the formation of active homodimer. We then demonstrate that IRF7 can be activated by both MAVS and STING in a manner highly similar to that of IRF3 but with one key difference. Regulation of IRF7 appears more tightly controlled; while a single phosphorylation event is sufficient to activate IRF3, at least two phosphorylation events are required for IRF7 activation.

33080014	Msh homeobox (Msx) is a subclass of homeobox transcriptional regulators that control cell lineage development, including the early stage of vertebrate limb development, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that Msx1 promotes the proliferation of myoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by enhancing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Msx1 directly binds to and upregulates the expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9) and Fgf18. Accordingly, knockdown or antibody neutralization of Fgf9/18 inhibits Msx1-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation. Mechanistically, we determined that the phosphorylation of Msx1 at Ser136 is critical for enhancing Fgf9 and Fgf18 expression and cell proliferation, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is apparently responsible for Ser136 phosphorylation. Furthermore, mesenchymal deletion of Msx1/2 results in decreased Fgf9 and Fgf18 expression and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which leads to serious defects in limb development in mice. Collectively, our findings established an important function of the Msx1-Fgf-MAPK signaling axis in promoting cell proliferation, thus providing a new mechanistic insight into limb development.	Phosphorylation of Msx1 promotes cell proliferation through the Fgf9/18-MAPK signaling pathway during embryonic limb development.	Nucleic acids research
33170271	LSH, a SNF2 family DNA helicase, is a key regulator of DNA methylation in mammals. How LSH facilitates DNA methylation is not well defined. While previous studies with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESc) and fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Lsh knockout mice have revealed a role of Lsh in de novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a/3b, here we report that LSH contributes to DNA methylation in various cell lines primarily by promoting DNA methylation by DNMT1. We show that loss of LSH has a much bigger effect in DNA methylation than loss of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LSH interacts with UHRF1 but not DNMT1 and facilitates UHRF1 chromatin association and UHRF1-catalyzed histone H3 ubiquitination in an ATPase activity-dependent manner, which in turn promotes DNMT1 recruitment to replication fork and DNA methylation. Notably, UHRF1 also enhances LSH association with the replication fork. Thus, our study identifies LSH as an essential factor for DNA methylation by DNMT1 and provides novel insight into how a feed-forward loop between LSH and UHRF1 facilitates DNMT1-mediated maintenance of DNA methylation in chromatin.

33231687	The biogenesis of eukaryotic RNA polymerases is poorly understood. The present study used a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to explore the assembly of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in yeast. We identified a regulatory link between Rbs1, a Pol III assembly factor, and Rpb10, a small subunit that is common to three RNA polymerases. Overexpression of Rbs1 increased the abundance of both RPB10 mRNA and the Rpb10 protein, which correlated with suppression of Pol III assembly defects. Rbs1 is a poly(A)mRNA-binding protein and mutational analysis identified R3H domain to be required for mRNA interactions and genetic enhancement of Pol III biogenesis. Rbs1 also binds to Upf1 protein, a key component in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and levels of RPB10 mRNA were increased in a upf1Delta strain. Genome-wide RNA binding by Rbs1 was characterized by UV cross-linking based approach. We demonstrated that Rbs1 directly binds to the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of many mRNAs including transcripts encoding Pol III subunits, Rpb10 and Rpc19. We propose that Rbs1 functions by opposing mRNA degradation, at least in part mediated by NMD pathway. Orthologues of Rbs1 protein are present in other eukaryotes, including humans, suggesting that this is a conserved regulatory mechanism.	The expression of Rpb10, a small subunit common to RNA polymerases, is modulated by the R3H domain-containing Rbs1 protein and the Upf1 helicase.	Nucleic acids research
33237263	PrimPol has been recently identified as a DNA damage tolerant polymerase that plays an important role in replication stress response. However, the regulatory mechanisms of PrimPol are not well defined. In this study, we identify that the deubiquitinase USP36 interferes with degradation of PrimPol to regulate the replication stress response. Mechanistically, USP36 is deubiquitinated following DNA replication stress, which in turn facilitates its upregulation and interaction with PrimPol. USP36 deubiquitinates K29-linked polyubiquitination of PrimPol and increases its protein stability. Depletion of USP36 results in replication stress-related defects and elevates cell sensitivity to DNA-damage agents, such as cisplatin and olaparib. Moreover, USP36 expression positively correlates with the level of PrimPol protein and poor prognosis in patient samples. These findings indicate that the regulation of PrimPol K29-linked ubiquitination by USP36 plays a critical role in DNA replication stress and chemotherapy response.	The deubiquitinase USP36 Regulates DNA replication stress and confers therapeutic resistance through PrimPol stabilization.	Nucleic acids research
33245768	PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.	PDCD2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved chaperone dedicated for the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2).	Nucleic acids research
33270893	Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs potently regulate gene expression programs in physiology and disease. Here, we describe a key function for lncRNA OIP5-AS1 in myogenesis, the process whereby myoblasts differentiate into myotubes during muscle development and muscle regeneration after injury. In human myoblasts, OIP5-AS1 levels increased robustly early in myogenesis, and its loss attenuated myogenic differentiation and potently reduced the levels of the myogenic transcription factor MEF2C. This effect relied upon the partial complementarity of OIP5-AS1 with MEF2C mRNA and the presence of HuR, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with affinity for both transcripts. Remarkably, HuR binding to MEF2C mRNA, which stabilized MEF2C mRNA and increased MEF2C abundance, was lost after OIP5-AS1 silencing, suggesting that OIP5-AS1 might serve as a scaffold to enhance HuR binding to MEF2C mRNA, in turn increasing MEF2C production. These results highlight a mechanism whereby a lncRNA promotes myogenesis by enhancing the interaction of an RBP and a myogenic mRNA.	Interaction of OIP5-AS1 with MEF2C mRNA promotes myogenic gene expression.	Nucleic acids research
33270882	The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to repress gene transcription in multicellular eukaryotes. Despite its importance in gene silencing and cellular differentiation, how PRC2 is recruited to target loci is still not fully understood. Here, we report genome-wide evidence for the recruitment of PRC2 by the transcriptional repressors VIVIPAROUS1/ABI3-LIKE1 (VAL1) and VAL2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the val1 val2 double mutant possesses somatic embryonic phenotypes and a transcriptome strikingly similar to those of the swn clf double mutant, which lacks the PRC2 catalytic subunits SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF). We further show that VAL1 and VAL2 physically interact with SWN and CLF in vivo. Genome-wide binding profiling demonstrated that they colocalize with SWN and CLF at PRC2 target loci. Loss of VAL1/2 significantly reduces SWN and CLF enrichment at PRC2 target loci and leads to a genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 that strongly affects transcription. Finally, we provide evidence that the VAL1/VAL2-RY regulatory system is largely independent of previously identified modules for Polycomb silencing in plants. Together, our work demonstrates an extensive genome-wide interaction between VAL1/2 and PRC2 and provides mechanistic insights into the establishment of Polycomb silencing in plants.

33332564	Secondary wall thickening in the sclerenchyma cells is strictly controlled by a complex network of transcription factors in vascular plants. However, little is known about the epigenetic mechanism regulating secondary wall biosynthesis. In this study, we identified that ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG of TRITHORAX1 (ATX1), a H3K4-histone methyltransferase, mediates the regulation of fiber cell wall development in inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis thaliana. Genome-wide analysis revealed that the up-regulation of genes involved in secondary wall formation during stem development is largely coordinated by increasing level of H3K4 tri-methylation. Among all histone methyltransferases for H3K4me3 in Arabidopsis, ATX1 is markedly increased during the inflorescence stem development and loss-of-function mutant atx1 was impaired in secondary wall thickening in interfascicular fibers. Genetic analysis showed that ATX1 positively regulates secondary wall deposition through activating the expression of secondary wall NAC master switch genes, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1) and NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1). We further identified that ATX1 directly binds the loci of SND1 and NST1, and activates their expression by increasing H3K4me3 levels at these loci. Taken together, our results reveal that ATX1 plays a key role in the regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in interfascicular fibers during inflorescence stem development of Arabidopsis.	Histone methyltransferase ATX1 dynamically regulates fiber secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis inflorescence stem.	Nucleic acids research
33348378	Repair of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) by the metalloprotease SPRTN prevents genome instability, premature aging and carcinogenesis. SPRTN is specifically activated by DNA structures containing single- and double-stranded features, but degrades the protein components of DPCs promiscuously and independent of amino acid sequence. This lack of specificity is useful to target diverse protein adducts, however, it requires tight control in return, in order to prohibit uncontrolled proteolysis of chromatin proteins. Here, we discover the components and principles of a ubiquitin switch, which negatively regulates SPRTN. We demonstrate that monoubiquitylation is induced in an E3 ligase-independent manner and, in contrast to previous assumptions, does not control chromatin access of the enzyme. Data obtained in cells and in vitro reveal that monoubiquitylation induces inactivation of the enzyme by triggering autocatalytic cleavage in trans while also priming SPRTN for proteasomal degradation in cis. Finally, we show that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP7 antagonizes this negative control of SPRTN in the presence of DPCs.	A ubiquitin switch controls autocatalytic inactivation of the DNA-protein crosslink repair protease SPRTN.	Nucleic acids research
33406258	Double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks are a significant threat to genomic stability that can lead to chromosomal rearrangements or cell death. The protein CtIP promotes DNA end resection, an early step in homologous recombination repair, and has been found to protect perturbed forks from excessive nucleolytic degradation. However, it remains unknown how CtIP's function in fork protection is regulated. Here, we show that CtIP recruitment to sites of DNA damage and replication stress is impaired upon global inhibition of SUMOylation. We demonstrate that CtIP is a target for modification by SUMO-2 and that this occurs constitutively during S phase. The modification is dependent on the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases and the PI-3-kinase-related kinase ATR on CtIP's carboxyl-terminal region, an interaction with the replication factor PCNA, and the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS4. We also identify residue K578 as a key residue that contributes to CtIP SUMOylation. Functionally, a CtIP mutant where K578 is substituted with a non-SUMOylatable arginine residue is defective in promoting DNA end resection, homologous recombination, and in protecting stalled replication forks from excessive nucleolytic degradation. Our results shed further light on the tightly coordinated regulation of CtIP by SUMOylation in the maintenance of genome stability.	SUMOylation mediates CtIP's functions in DNA end resection and replication fork protection.	Nucleic acids research
33450002	DNA damage response is a fundamental mechanism to maintain genome stability. The ATR-WEE1 kinase module plays a central role in response to replication stress. Although the ATR-WEE1 pathway has been well studied in yeasts and animals, how ATR-WEE1 functions in plants remains unclear. Through a genetic screen for suppressors of the Arabidopsis atr mutant, we found that loss of function of PRL1, a core subunit of the evolutionarily conserved MAC complex involved in alternative splicing, suppresses the hypersensitivity of atr and wee1 to replication stress. Biochemical studies revealed that WEE1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates PRL1 at Serine 145, which promotes PRL1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In line with the genetic and biochemical data, replication stress induces intron retention of cell cycle genes including CYCD1;1 and CYCD3;1, which is abolished in wee1 but restored in wee1 prl1. Remarkably, co-expressing the coding sequences of CYCD1;1 and CYCD3;1 partially restores the root length and HU response in wee1 prl1. These data suggested that the ATR-WEE1 module inhibits the MAC complex to regulate replication stress responses. Our study discovered PRL1 or the MAC complex as a key downstream regulator of the ATR-WEE1 module and revealed a novel cell cycle control mechanism.

33444446	Alkylating drugs are among the most often used chemotherapeutics. While cancer cells frequently develop resistance to alkylation treatments, detailed understanding of mechanisms that lead to the resistance is limited. Here, by using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 based screen, we identify transcriptional Mediator complex subunit 13 (MED13) as a novel modulator of alkylation response. The alkylation exposure causes significant MED13 downregulation, while complete loss of MED13 results in reduced apoptosis and resistance to alkylating agents. Transcriptome analysis identified cyclin D1 (CCND1) as one of the highly overexpressed genes in MED13 knock-out (KO) cells, characterized by shorter G1 phase. MED13 is able to bind to CCND1 regulatory elements thus influencing the expression. The resistance of MED13 KO cells is directly dependent on the cyclin D1 overexpression, and its down-regulation is sufficient to re-sensitize the cells to alkylating agents. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MED13-mediated response, by applying combinatory treatment with CDK8/19 inhibitor Senexin A. Importantly, the treatment with Senexin A stabilizes MED13, and in combination with alkylating agents significantly reduces viability of cancer cells. In summary, our findings identify novel alkylation stress response mechanism dependent on MED13 and cyclin D1 that can serve as basis for development of innovative therapeutic strategies.	Loss of Mediator complex subunit 13 (MED13) promotes resistance to alkylation through cyclin D1 upregulation.	Nucleic acids research
33544864	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a wide range of roles in the epigenetic regulation of crucial biological processes, but the functions of lncRNAs in cortical development are poorly understood. Using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based 2D neural differentiation approach and 3D cerebral organoid system, we identified that the lncRNA PAUPAR, which is adjacent to PAX6, plays essential roles in cortical differentiation by interacting with PAX6 to regulate the expression of a large number of neural genes. Mechanistic studies showed that PAUPAR confers PAX6 proper binding sites on the target neural genes by directly binding the genomic regions of these genes. Moreover, PAX6 recruits the histone methyltransferase NSD1 through its C-terminal PST enrichment domain, then regulate H3K36 methylation and the expression of target genes. Collectively, our data reveal that the PAUPAR/PAX6/NSD1 complex plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of hESC cortical differentiation and highlight the importance of PAUPAR as an intrinsic regulator of cortical differentiation.

33503260	Maintenance of stem-cell identity requires proper regulation of enhancer activity. Both transcription factors OCT4/SOX2/NANOG and histone methyltransferase complexes MLL/SET1 were shown to regulate enhancer activity, but how they are regulated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains further studies. Here, we report a transcription factor BACH1, which directly interacts with OCT4/SOX2/NANOG (OSN) and MLL/SET1 methyltransferase complexes and maintains pluripotency in mouse ESCs (mESCs). BTB domain and bZIP domain of BACH1 are required for these interactions and pluripotency maintenance. Loss of BACH1 reduced the interaction between NANOG and MLL1/SET1 complexes, and decreased their occupancy on chromatin, and further decreased H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) level on gene promoters and (super-) enhancers, leading to decreased enhancer activity and transcription activity, especially on stemness-related genes. Moreover, BACH1 recruited NANOG through chromatin looping and regulated remote NANOG binding, fine-tuning enhancer-promoter activity and gene expression. Collectively, these observations suggest that BACH1 maintains pluripotency in ESCs by recruiting NANOG and MLL/SET1 complexes to chromatin and maintaining the trimethylated state of H3K4 and enhancer-promoter activity, especially on stemness-related genes.

33619536	The major clinical problem in human cancer is metastasis. Metastases are the cause of 90% of human cancer deaths. TAp63 is a critical suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis. DeltaNp63 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor to block the function of p53 and TAp63. Although several ubiquitin E3 ligases have been reported to regulate p63 stability, the mechanism of p63 regulation remains partially understood. Herein, we show that CHIP, an E3 ligase with a U-box domain, physically interacts with p63 and promotes p63 degradation. Notably, Hsp70 depletion by siRNA stabilizes TAp63 in H1299 cells and destabilizes DeltaNp63 in SCC9 cells. Loss of Hsp70 results in a reduction in the TAp63-CHIP interaction in H1299 cells and an increase in the interaction between DeltaNp63 and CHIP in SCC9 cells. Our results reveal that Hsp70 acts as a molecular switch to control CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p63 isoforms. Furthermore, regulation of p63 by the Hsp70-CHIP axis contributes to the migration and invasion of tumor cells. Hence, our findings demonstrate that Hsp70 is a crucial regulator of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p63 isoforms and identify a new pathway for maintaining TAp63 or DeltaNp63 stability in cancers.	Hsp70 acts as a fine-switch that controls E3 ligase CHIP-mediated TAp63 and DeltaNp63 ubiquitination and degradation.	Nucleic acids research
33591310	The DNA damage-responsive tumor suppressors p53 and HIPK2 are well established regulators of cell fate decision-making and regulate the cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs. Here, we identify Deleted in Azoospermia-associated protein 2 (DAZAP2), a small adaptor protein, as a novel regulator of HIPK2 and specifier of the DNA damage-induced p53 response. Knock-down or genetic deletion of DAZAP2 strongly potentiates cancer cell chemosensitivity both in cells and in vivo using a mouse tumour xenograft model. In unstressed cells, DAZAP2 stimulates HIPK2 polyubiquitination and degradation through interplay with the ubiquitin ligase SIAH1. Upon DNA damage, HIPK2 site-specifically phosphorylates DAZAP2, which terminates its HIPK2-degrading function and triggers its re-localization to the cell nucleus. Interestingly, nuclear DAZAP2 interacts with p53 and specifies target gene expression through modulating a defined subset of p53 target genes. Furthermore, our results suggest that DAZAP2 co-occupies p53 response elements to specify target gene expression. Collectively, our findings propose DAZAP2 as novel regulator of the DNA damage-induced p53 response that controls cancer cell chemosensitivity.	DAZAP2 acts as specifier of the p53 response to DNA damage.	Nucleic acids research
33589924	The ubiquitous RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) promotes telomerase activity by associating with the telomerase noncoding RNA TERC. However, the role of the neural-specific members HuB, HuC, and HuD (ELAVL2-4) in telomerase activity is unknown. Here, we report that HuB and HuD, but not HuC, repress telomerase activity in human neuroblastoma cells. By associating with AU-rich sequences in TERC, HuB and HuD repressed the assembly of the TERT-TERC core complex. Furthermore, HuB and HuD competed with HuR for binding to TERC and antagonized the function of HuR that was previously shown to enhance telomerase activity to promote cell growth. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism controlling telomerase activity in human neuroblastoma cells that involves a competition between HuR and the related, neural-specific proteins HuB and HuD.	HuB and HuD repress telomerase activity by dissociating HuR from TERC.	Nucleic acids research
33660778	DNA repair pathways are essential to maintain the integrity of the genome and prevent cell death and tumourigenesis. Here, we show that the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (Banf1) protein has a role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Banf1 is characterized as a nuclear envelope protein and mutations in Banf1 are associated with the severe premature aging syndrome, Nestor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome. We have previously shown that Banf1 directly regulates the activity of PARP1 in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Here, we show that Banf1 also has a role in modulating DNA double-strand break repair through regulation of the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. Specifically, we demonstrate that Banf1 relocalizes from the nuclear envelope to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. We also show that Banf1 can bind to and directly inhibit the activity of DNA-PKcs. Supporting this, cellular depletion of Banf1 leads to an increase in non-homologous end-joining and a decrease in homologous recombination, which our data suggest is likely due to unrestrained DNA-PKcs activity. Overall, this study identifies how Banf1 regulates double-strand break repair pathway choice by modulating DNA-PKcs activity to control genome stability within the cell.	Barrier-to-autointegration-factor (Banf1) modulates DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice via regulation of DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) activity.	Nucleic acids research
33704464	RPA is a critical factor for DNA replication and replication stress response. Surprisingly, we found that chromatin RPA stability is tightly regulated. We report that the GDP/GTP exchange factor DOCK7 acts as a critical replication stress regulator to promote RPA stability on chromatin. DOCK7 is phosphorylated by ATR and then recruited by MDC1 to the chromatin and replication fork during replication stress. DOCK7-mediated Rac1/Cdc42 activation leads to the activation of PAK1, which subsequently phosphorylates RPA1 at S135 and T180 to stabilize chromatin-loaded RPA1 and ensure proper replication stress response. Moreover, DOCK7 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and depleting DOCK7 sensitizes cancer cells to camptothecin. Taken together, our results highlight a novel role for DOCK7 in regulation of the replication stress response and highlight potential therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance in cancer.	DOCK7 protects against replication stress by promoting RPA stability on chromatin.	Nucleic acids research
33398329	LARP1 is a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation. It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety and the adjacent 5'TOP motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation via LARP1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls LARP1's translation repression activity. We demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates LARP1 in vitro and in vivo, activities that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26 rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on LARP1 that are distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding DM15 region is particularly sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the RNA-binding and the translation inhibitory activities of LARP1. Our results unravel a new model of translation control in which the La module (LaMod) and DM15 region of LARP1, both of which can directly interact with TOP mRNA, are differentially regulated: the LaMod remains constitutively bound to PABP (irrespective of the activation status of mTORC1), while the C-terminal DM15 'pendular hook' engages the TOP mRNA 5'-end to repress translation, but only in conditions of mTORC1 inhibition.	mTORC1 promotes TOP mRNA translation through site-specific phosphorylation of LARP1.

33660773	Post-transcriptional control is essential to safeguard structural and metabolic changes in enucleated reticulocytes during their terminal maturation to functional erythrocytes. The timely synthesis of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which initiates mitochondria degradation at the final stage of reticulocyte maturation is regulated by the multifunctional protein HNRNPK. It constitutes a silencing complex at the ALOX15 mRNA 3' untranslated region that inhibits translation initiation at the AUG by impeding the joining of ribosomal 60S subunits to 40S subunits. To elucidate how HNRNPK interferes with 80S ribosome assembly, three independent screens were applied. They consistently demonstrated a differential interaction of HNRNPK with RPS19, which is localized at the head of the 40S subunit and extends into its functional center. During induced erythroid maturation of K562 cells, decreasing arginine dimethylation of HNRNPK is linked to a reduced interaction with RPS19 in vitro and in vivo. Dimethylation of residues R256, R258 and R268 in HNRNPK affects its interaction with RPS19. In noninduced K562 cells, RPS19 depletion results in the induction of ALOX15 synthesis and mitochondria degradation. Interestingly, residue W52 in RPS19, which is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), participates in specific HNRNPK binding and is an integral part of a putative aromatic cage.	Methylated HNRNPK acts on RPS19 to regulate ALOX15 synthesis in erythropoiesis.	Nucleic acids research
33675668	Molecular bases of eukaryotic circadian clocks mainly rely on transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs), while epigenetic codes also play critical roles in fine-tuning circadian rhythms. However, unlike histone modification codes that play extensive and well-known roles in the regulation of circadian clocks, whether DNA methylation (5mC) can affect the circadian clock, and the associated underlying molecular mechanisms, remains largely unexplored in many organisms. Here we demonstrate that global genome DNA hypomethylation can significantly lengthen the circadian period of Arabidopsis. Transcriptomic and genetic evidence demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), encoding an F-box containing protein, is required for the DNA hypomethylation-tuned circadian clock. Moreover, SDC can physically interact with another F-box containing protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) to diminish its accumulation. Genetic analysis further revealed that ZTL and its substrate TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) likely act downstream of DNA methyltransferases to control circadian rhythm. Together, our findings support the notion that DNA methylation is important to maintain proper circadian pace in Arabidopsis, and further established that SDC links DNA hypomethylation with a proteolytic cascade to assist in tuning the circadian clock.	SDC mediates DNA methylation-controlled clock pace by interacting with ZTL in Arabidopsis.	Nucleic acids research
33744966	The family of Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulates the stability and translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we reported that the three members of PABPs, including PABPC1, PABPC3 and PABPC4, were identified as novel substrates for MKRN3, whose deletion or loss-of-function mutations were genetically associated with human central precocious puberty (CPP). MKRN3-mediated ubiquitination was found to attenuate the binding of PABPs to the poly(A) tails of mRNA, which led to shortened poly(A) tail-length of GNRH1 mRNA and compromised the formation of translation initiation complex (TIC). Recently, we have shown that MKRN3 epigenetically regulates the transcription of GNRH1 through conjugating poly-Ub chains onto methyl-DNA bind protein 3 (MBD3). Therefore, MKRN3-mediated ubiquitin signalling could control both transcriptional and post-transcriptional switches of mammalian puberty initiation. While identifying MKRN3 as a novel tissue-specific translational regulator, our work also provided new mechanistic insights into the etiology of MKRN3 dysfunction-associated human CPP.	MKRN3-mediated ubiquitination of Poly(A)-binding proteins modulates the stability and translation of GNRH1 mRNA in mammalian puberty.	Nucleic acids research
33744941	Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), encoded by the BANF1 gene, is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed metazoan protein that has multiple functions during the cell cycle. Through its ability to cross-bridge two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), it favours chromosome compaction, participates in post-mitotic nuclear envelope reassembly and is essential for the repair of large nuclear ruptures. BAF forms a ternary complex with the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and emerin, and its interaction with lamin A/C is defective in patients with recessive accelerated aging syndromes. Phosphorylation of BAF by the vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a key regulator of BAF localization and function. Here, we demonstrate that VRK1 successively phosphorylates BAF on Ser4 and Thr3. The crystal structures of BAF before and after phosphorylation are extremely similar. However, in solution, the extensive flexibility of the N-terminal helix alpha1 and loop alpha1alpha2 in BAF is strongly reduced in di-phosphorylated BAF, due to interactions between the phosphorylated residues and the positively charged C-terminal helix alpha6. These regions are involved in DNA and lamin A/C binding. Consistently, phosphorylation causes a 5000-fold loss of affinity for dsDNA. However, it does not impair binding to lamin A/C Igfold domain and emerin nucleoplasmic region, which leaves open the question of the regulation of these interactions.	Di-phosphorylated BAF shows altered structural dynamics and binding to DNA, but interacts with its nuclear envelope partners.	Nucleic acids research
33849069	Although overexpression of EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is an eminent feature of various cancers, the regulation of its abundance and function remains insufficiently understood. We report here that the PRC2 complex is physically associated with ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 in cancer cells where USP7 acts to deubiquitinate and stabilize EZH2. Interestingly, we found that USP7-catalyzed H2BK120ub1 deubiquitination is a prerequisite for chromatin loading of PRC2 thus H3K27 trimethylation, and this process is not affected by H2AK119 ubiquitination catalyzed by PRC1. Genome-wide analysis of the transcriptional targets of the USP7/PRC2 complex identified a cohort of genes including FOXO1 that are involved in cell growth and proliferation. We demonstrated that the USP7/PRC2 complex drives cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the expression of both USP7 and EZH2 elevates during tumor progression, corresponding to a diminished FOXO1 expression, and the level of the expression of USP7 and EZH2 strongly correlates with histological grades and prognosis of tumor patients. These results reveal a dual role for USP7 in the regulation of the abundance and function of EZH2, supporting the pursuit of USP7 as a therapeutic target for cancer intervention.	Bimodal regulation of the PRC2 complex by USP7 underlies tumorigenesis.	Nucleic acids research
33849067	Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a terminal disease and the molecular underpinnings of CRPC development need to be better understood in order to improve its treatment. Here, we report that a transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is significantly overexpressed during prostate cancer progression. Functional and cistrome studies of YY1 uncover its roles in promoting prostate oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as sustaining tumor metabolism including the Warburg effect and mitochondria respiration. Additionally, our integrated genomics and interactome profiling in prostate tumor show that YY1 and bromodomain-containing proteins (BRD2/4) co-occupy a majority of gene-regulatory elements, coactivating downstream targets. Via gene loss-of-function and rescue studies and mutagenesis of YY1-bound cis-elements, we unveil an oncogenic pathway in which YY1 directly binds and activates PFKP, a gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, significantly contributing to the YY1-enforced Warburg effect and malignant growth. Altogether, this study supports a master regulator role for YY1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals a YY1:BRD2/4-PFKP axis operating in advanced prostate cancer with implications for therapy.	Cistrome analysis of YY1 uncovers a regulatory axis of YY1:BRD2/4-PFKP during tumorigenesis of advanced prostate cancer.	Nucleic acids research
33893802	The eIF4E are a family of initiation factors that bind the mRNA 5' cap, regulating the proteome and the cellular phenotype. eIF4E1 mediates global translation and its activity is controlled via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR down-regulation results in eIF4E1 sequestration into an inactive complex with the 4E binding proteins (4EBPs). The second member, eIF4E2, regulates the translatome during hypoxia. However, the exact function of the third member, eIF4E3, has remained elusive. We have dissected its function using a range of techniques. Starting from the observation that it does not interact with 4EBP1, we demonstrate that eIF4E3 recruitment into an eIF4F complex occurs when Torin1 inhibits the mTOR pathway. Ribo-seq studies demonstrate that this complex (eIF4FS) is translationally active during stress and that it selects specific mRNA populations based on 5' TL (UTR) length. The interactome reveals that it associates with cellular proteins beyond the cognate initiation factors, suggesting that it may have 'moon-lighting' functions. Finally, we provide evidence that cellular metabolism is altered in an eIF4E3 KO background but only upon Torin1 treatment. We propose that eIF4E3 acts as a second branch of the integrated stress response, re-programming the translatome to promote 'stress resistance' and adaptation.	eIF4E3 forms an active eIF4F complex during stresses (eIF4FS) targeting mTOR and re-programs the translatome.

33963860	The histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transactions (FACT) functions in various DNA transactions. How FACT performs these multiple functions remains largely unknown. Here, we found, for the first time, that the N-terminal domain of its Spt16 subunit interacts with the Set3 histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) and that FACT and Set3C function in the same pathway to regulate gene expression in some settings. We observed that Spt16-G132D mutant proteins show defects in binding to Set3C but not other reported FACT interactors. At the permissive temperature, induction of the GAL1 and GAL10 genes is reduced in both spt16-G132D and set3Delta cells, whereas transient upregulation of GAL10 noncoding RNA (ncRNA), which is transcribed from the 3' end of the GAL10 gene, is elevated. Mutations that inhibit GAL10 ncRNA transcription reverse the GAL1 and GAL10 induction defects in spt16-G132D and set3Delta mutant cells. Mechanistically, set3Delta and FACT (spt16-G132D) mutants show reduced histone acetylation and increased nucleosome occupancy at the GAL1 promoter under inducing conditions and inhibition of GAL10 ncRNA transcription also partially reverses these chromatin changes. These results indicate that FACT interacts with Set3C, which in turn prevents uncontrolled GAL10 ncRNA expression and fine-tunes the expression of GAL genes upon a change in carbon source.	FACT interacts with Set3 HDAC and fine-tunes GAL1 transcription in response to environmental stimulation.	Nucleic acids research
33978753	Rat1 is a 5'-->3' exoribonuclease in budding yeast. It is a highly conserved protein with homologs being present in fission yeast, flies, worms, mice and humans. Rat1 and its human homolog Xrn2 have been implicated in multiple nuclear processes. Here we report a novel role of Rat1 in mRNA splicing. We observed an increase in the level of unspliced transcripts in mutants of Rat1. Accumulation of unspliced transcripts was not due to the surveillance role of Rat1 in degrading unspliced mRNA, or an indirect effect of Rat1 function in termination of transcription or on the level of splicing factors in the cell, or due to an increased elongation rate in Rat1 mutants. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed Rat1 crosslinking to the introns of a subset of yeast genes. Mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation revealed an interaction of Rat1 with the Clf1, Isy1, Yju2, Prp43 and Sub2 splicing factors. Furthermore, recruitment of splicing factors on the intron was compromised in the Rat1 mutant. Based on these findings we propose that Rat1 has a novel role in splicing of mRNA in budding yeast. Rat1, however, is not a general splicing factor as it crosslinks to only long introns with an average length of 400 nucleotides.	A termination-independent role of Rat1 in cotranscriptional splicing.

33999206	The intestinal invasion of pathogenic microorganisms can have serious health consequences. Recent evidence has shown that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is closely associated with innate immunity; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we examined the function and mechanism of m6A mRNA modification and the YTH domain-containing protein YTHDF1 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 1) in the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens in the intestine. Ribo-seq and m6A-seq analyses revealed that YTHDF1 directs the translation of Traf6 mRNA, which encodes tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, thereby regulating the immune response via the m6A modification near the transcript's stop codon. Furthermore, we identified a unique mechanism by which the P/Q/N-rich domain in YTHDF1 interacts with the DEAD domain in the host factor DDX60, thereby regulating the intestinal immune response to bacterial infection by recognizing the target Traf6 transcript. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which YTHDF1 recognizes its target and reveal YTHDF1 as an important driver of the intestinal immune response, opening new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies designed to modulate the intestinal immune response to bacterial infection.	The N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein YTHDF1 modulates the translation of TRAF6 to mediate the intestinal immune response.	Nucleic acids research
34048572	Faithful genome integrity maintenance plays an essential role in cell survival. Here, we identify the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 as a key regulator that protects cells from DNA damage and apoptosis during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. We find that ROS significantly induces global mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels by modulating ALKBH5 post-translational modifications (PTMs), leading to the rapid and efficient induction of thousands of genes involved in a variety of biological processes including DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, ROS promotes ALKBH5 SUMOylation through activating ERK/JNK signaling, leading to inhibition of ALKBH5 m6A demethylase activity by blocking substrate accessibility. Moreover, ERK/JNK/ALKBH5-PTMs/m6A axis is activated by ROS in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo in mice, suggesting a physiological role of this molecular pathway in the maintenance of genome stability in HSPCs. Together, our study uncovers a molecular mechanism involving ALKBH5 PTMs and increased mRNA m6A levels that protect genomic integrity of cells in response to ROS.	Post-translational modification of RNA m6A demethylase ALKBH5 regulates ROS-induced DNA damage response.	Nucleic acids research
34107030	Epigenetics, especially histone marks, functions beyond the DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. Depletion of NSD1, which catalyzes H3K36me2, leads to both up- and down-regulation of gene expression, indicating NSD1 is associated with both active and repressed gene expression. It's known that NSD1 regulates the deposition and expansion of H3K27me3, a repressive mark for gene expression, to keep active gene transcription. However, how NSD1 functions to repress gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we find that, when NSD1 is knocked out in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), H3K27ac increases correlatively with the decrease of H3K36me2 at active enhancers, which is associated with mesoderm differentiation genes, leading to elevated gene expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 recruits HDAC1, the deacetylase of H3K27ac, to chromatin. Moreover, HDAC1 knockout (KO) recapitulates the increase of H3K27ac at active enhancers as the NSD1 depletion. Together, we propose that NSD1 deposits H3K36me2 and recruits HDAC1 at active enhancers to serve as a 'safeguard', preventing further activation of active enhancer-associated genes.	The H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 modulates H3K27ac at active enhancers to safeguard gene expression.	Nucleic acids research
34096589	Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by photosensitivity, developmental defects, neurological abnormalities, and premature aging. Mutations in CSA (ERCC8), CSB (ERCC6), XPB, XPD, XPG, XPF (ERCC4) and ERCC1 can give rise to clinical phenotypes resembling classic CS. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening approach, we identified LEO1 (Phe381-Ser568 region) as an interacting protein partner of full-length and C-terminal (Pro1010-Cys1493) CSB in two independent screens. LEO1 is a member of the RNA polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) with roles in transcription elongation and chromatin modification. Supportive of the Y2H results, purified, recombinant LEO1 and CSB directly interact in vitro, and the two proteins exist in a common complex within human cells. In addition, fluorescently tagged LEO1 and CSB are both recruited to localized DNA damage sites in human cells. Cell fractionation experiments revealed a transcription-dependent, coordinated association of LEO1 and CSB to chromatin following either UVC irradiation or cisplatin treatment of HEK293T cells, whereas the response to menadione was distinct, suggesting that this collaboration occurs mainly in the context of bulky transcription-blocking lesions. Consistent with a coordinated interaction in DNA repair, LEO1 knockdown or knockout resulted in reduced CSB recruitment to chromatin, increased sensitivity to UVC light and cisplatin damage, and reduced RNA synthesis recovery and slower excision of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers following UVC irradiation; the absence of CSB resulted in diminished LEO1 recruitment. Our data indicate a reciprocal communication between CSB and LEO1 in the context of transcription-associated DNA repair and RNA transcription recovery.

34096602	The TREX-TAP pathway is vital for mRNA export. For spliced mRNA, the TREX complex is recruited during splicing; however, for intronless mRNA, recruitment is sequence dependent. However, the export of cytoplasmic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is poorly characterized. We report the identification of a cytoplasmic accumulation region (CAR-N) in the intronless lncRNA, NKILA. CAR-N removal led to strong nuclear retention of NKILA, and CAR-N insertion promoted the export of cDNA transcripts. In vitro RNP purification via CAR-N, mass spectrometry, and siRNA screening revealed that SRSF1 and SRSF7 were vital to NKILA export, and identified a cluster of SRSF1/7 binding sites within a 55 nucleotide sequence in CAR-N. Significant nuclear enrichment of NKILA was observed for NKILA lacking CAR-N or the cluster of binding sites in knock-in models. Depletion of TREX-TAP pathway components resulted in strong nuclear retention of NKILA. RNA and protein immunoprecipitation verified that SRSF1/7 were bound to NKILA and interacted with UAP56 and ALYREF. Moreover, NKILA lacking CAR-N was unable to inhibit breast cancer cell migration. We concluded that the binding of SRSF1/7 to clustered motifs in CAR-N facilitated TREX recruitment, promoting the export of NKILA, and confirmed the importance of NKILA localization to its function.

34096600	The biogenesis of small uridine-rich nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs) depends on the methylation of Sm proteins catalyzed by the methylosome and the subsequent action of the SMN complex, which assembles the heptameric Sm protein ring onto small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). In this sophisticated process, the methylosome subunit pICln (chloride conductance regulatory protein) is attributed to an exceptional key position as an 'assembly chaperone' by building up a stable precursor Sm protein ring structure. Here, we show that-apart from its autophagic role-the Ser/Thr kinase ULK1 (Uncoordinated [unc-51] Like Kinase 1) functions as a novel key regulator in UsnRNP biogenesis by phosphorylation of the C-terminus of pICln. As a consequence, phosphorylated pICln is no longer capable to hold up the precursor Sm ring structure. Consequently, inhibition of ULK1 results in a reduction of efficient UsnRNP core assembly. Thus ULK1, depending on its complex formation, exerts different functions in autophagy or snRNP biosynthesis.	An essential role of the autophagy activating kinase ULK1 in snRNP biogenesis.

34107032	RNA-protein interactions are central to all gene expression processes and contribute to a variety of human diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting RNA-protein interactions have shown promising effects on some diseases that are previously regarded as 'incurable'. Here, we developed a fluorescent on-bead screening platform, RNA Pull-Down COnfocal NAnoscanning (RP-CONA), to identify RNA-protein interaction modulators in eukaryotic cell extracts. Using RP-CONA, we identified small molecules that disrupt the interaction between HuR, an inhibitor of brain-enriched miR-7 biogenesis, and the conserved terminal loop of pri-miR-7-1. Importantly, miR-7's primary target is an mRNA of alpha-synuclein, which contributes to the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Our method identified a natural product quercetin as a molecule able to upregulate cellular miR-7 levels and downregulate the expression of alpha-synuclein. This opens up new therapeutic avenues towards treatment of Parkinson's disease as well as provides a novel methodology to search for modulators of RNA-protein interaction.

34133717	Speckle-type Poz protein (SPOP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, is the most frequently mutated gene in prostate cancer. The SPOP-mutated subtype of prostate cancer shows high genomic instability, but the underlying mechanisms causing this phenotype are still largely unknown. Here, we report that upon DNA damage, SPOP is phosphorylated at Ser119 by the ATM serine/threonine kinase, which potentiates the binding of SPOP to homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), resulting in a nondegradative ubiquitination of HIPK2. This modification subsequently increases the phosphorylation activity of HIPK2 toward HP1gamma, and then promotes the dissociation of HP1gamma from trimethylated (Lys9) histone H3 (H3K9me3) to initiate DNA damage repair. Moreover, the effect of SPOP on the HIPK2-HP1gamma axis is abrogated by prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SPOP mutations-driven genomic instability in prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations lead to genomic instability through disruption of the SPOP-HIPK2 axis.	Nucleic acids research
34142161	Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is a major plasma selenoprotein that contains 10 Sec residues, which is encoded by the UGA stop codon. The mRNA for SELENOP has the unique property of containing two Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, which is located in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Here, we coincidentally identified a novel gene, CCDC152, by sequence analysis. This gene was located in the antisense region of the SELENOP gene, including the 3'UTR region in the genome. We demonstrated that this novel gene functioned as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that decreased SELENOP protein levels via translational rather than transcriptional, regulation. We found that the CCDC152 RNA interacted specifically and directly with the SELENOP mRNA and inhibited its binding to the SECIS-binding protein 2, resulting in the decrease of ribosome binding. We termed this novel gene product lncRNA inhibitor of SELENOP translation (L-IST). Finally, we found that epigallocatechin gallate upregulated L-IST in vitro and in vivo, to suppress SELENOP protein levels. Here, we provide a new regulatory mechanism of SELENOP translation by an endogenous long antisense ncRNA.

34133725	Reinitiation supporting protein, RISP, interacts with 60S (60S ribosomal subunit) and eIF3 (eukaryotic initiation factor 3) in plants. TOR (target-of-rapamycin) mediates RISP phosphorylation at residue Ser267, favoring its binding to eL24 (60S ribosomal protein L24). In a viral context, RISP, when phosphorylated, binds the CaMV transactivator/ viroplasmin, TAV, to assist in an exceptional mechanism of reinitiation after long ORF translation. Moreover, we show here that RISP interacts with eIF2 via eIF2beta and TOR downstream target 40S ribosomal protein eS6. A RISP phosphorylation knockout, RISP-S267A, binds preferentially eIF2beta, and both form a ternary complex with eIF3a in vitro. Accordingly, transient overexpression in plant protoplasts of RISP-S267A, but not a RISP phosphorylation mimic, RISP-S267D, favors translation initiation. In contrast, RISP-S267D preferentially binds eS6, and, when bound to the C-terminus of eS6, can capture 60S in a highly specific manner in vitro, suggesting that it mediates 60S loading during reinitiation. Indeed, eS6-deficient plants are highly resistant to CaMV due to their reduced reinitiation capacity. Strikingly, an eS6 phosphomimic, when stably expressed in eS6-deficient plants, can fully restore the reinitiation deficiency of these plants in cellular and viral contexts. These results suggest that RISP function in translation (re)initiation is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser267.	Phosphorylation of a reinitiation supporting protein, RISP, determines its function in translation reinitiation.	Nucleic acids research
34197606	Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a master kinase that regulates cell cycle progression. How its enzymatic activity is regulated in response to DNA damage is not fully understood. We show that PLK1 is enriched at double strand breaks (DSBs) within seconds of UV laser irradiation in a PARP-1-dependent manner and then disperses within 10 min in a PARG-dependent manner. Poly(ADP-)ribose (PAR) chains directly bind to PLK1 in vitro and inhibit its enzymatic activity. CHK1-mediated PLK1 phosphorylation at S137 prevents its binding to PAR and recruitment to DSBs but ensures PLK1 phosphorylation at T210 and its enzymatic activity toward RAD51 at S14. This subsequent phosphorylation event at S14 primes RAD51 for CHK1-mediated phosphorylation at T309, which is essential for full RAD51 activation. This CHK1-PLK1-RAD51 axis ultimately promotes homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair and ensures chromosome stability and cellular radiosensitivity. These findings provide biological insight for combined cancer therapy using inhibitors of PARG and CHK1.	PARP1 and CHK1 coordinate PLK1 enzymatic activity during the DNA damage response to promote homologous recombination-mediated repair.	Nucleic acids research
34197623	Despite its prominence, the mechanisms through which the tumor suppressor p53 regulates most genes remain unclear. Recently, the regulatory factor X 7 (RFX7) emerged as a suppressor of lymphoid neoplasms, but its regulation and target genes mediating tumor suppression remain unknown. Here, we identify a novel p53-RFX7 signaling axis. Integrative analysis of the RFX7 DNA binding landscape and the RFX7-regulated transcriptome in three distinct cell systems reveals that RFX7 directly controls multiple established tumor suppressors, including PDCD4, PIK3IP1, MXD4, and PNRC1, across cell types and is the missing link for their activation in response to p53 and stress. RFX7 target gene expression correlates with cell differentiation and better prognosis in numerous cancer types. Interestingly, we find that RFX7 sensitizes cells to Doxorubicin by promoting apoptosis. Together, our work establishes RFX7's role as a ubiquitous regulator of cell growth and fate determination and a key node in the p53 transcriptional program.	Transcription factor RFX7 governs a tumor suppressor network in response to p53 and stress.	Nucleic acids research
34214177	Heterochromatin binding protein HP1beta plays an important role in chromatin organization and cell differentiation, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we generated HP1beta-/- embryonic stem cells and observed reduced heterochromatin clustering and impaired differentiation. We found that during stem cell differentiation, HP1beta is phosphorylated at serine 89 by CK2, which creates a binding site for the pluripotency regulator KAP1. This phosphorylation dependent sequestration of KAP1 in heterochromatin compartments causes a downregulation of pluripotency factors and triggers pluripotency exit. Accordingly, HP1beta-/- and phospho-mutant cells exhibited impaired differentiation, while ubiquitination-deficient KAP1-/- cells had the opposite phenotype with enhanced differentiation. These results suggest that KAP1 regulates pluripotency via its ubiquitination activity. We propose that the formation of subnuclear membraneless heterochromatin compartments may serve as a dynamic reservoir to trap or release cellular factors. The sequestration of essential regulators defines a novel and active role of heterochromatin in gene regulation and represents a dynamic mode of remote control to regulate cellular processes like cell fate decisions.	Phosphorylation of the HP1beta hinge region sequesters KAP1 in heterochromatin and promotes the exit from naive pluripotency.	Nucleic acids research
34181735	A major stress response influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs) is senescence, a state of indefinite growth arrest triggered by sublethal cell damage. Here, through bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, we identified miR-340-5p as a novel miRNA that foments cellular senescence. miR-340-5p was highly abundant in diverse senescence models, and miR-340-5p overexpression in proliferating cells rendered them senescent. Among the target mRNAs, miR-340-5p prominently reduced the levels of LBR mRNA, encoding lamin B receptor (LBR). Loss of LBR by ectopic overexpression of miR-340-5p derepressed heterochromatin in lamina-associated domains, promoting the expression of DNA repetitive elements characteristic of senescence. Importantly, overexpressing miR-340-5p enhanced cellular sensitivity to senolytic compounds, while antagonization of miR-340-5p reduced senescent cell markers and engendered resistance to senolytic-induced cell death. We propose that miR-340-5p can be exploited for removing senescent cells to restore tissue homeostasis and mitigate damage by senescent cells in pathologies of human aging.	Reduction of lamin B receptor levels by miR-340-5p disrupts chromatin, promotes cell senescence and enhances senolysis.	Nucleic acids research
34244791	The yeast cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase, encompassing three catalytic (Tpk1-3) and one regulatory (Bcy1) subunits. Evidence suggests PKA involvement in DNA damage checkpoint response, but how DNA repair pathways are regulated by PKA subunits remains inconclusive. Here, we report that deleting the tpk1 catalytic subunit reduces non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) efficiency, whereas tpk2-3 and bcy1 deletion does not. Epistatic analyses revealed that tpk1, as well as the DNA damage checkpoint kinase (dun1) and NHEJ factor (nej1), co-function in the same pathway, and parallel to the NHEJ factor yku80. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and resection data suggest that tpk1 deletion influences repair protein recruitments and DNA resection. Further, we show that Tpk1 phosphorylation of Nej1 at S298 (a Dun1 phosphosite) is indispensable for NHEJ repair and nuclear targeting of Nej1 and its binding partner Lif1. In mammalian cells, loss of PRKACB (human homolog of Tpk1) also reduced NHEJ efficiency, and similarly, PRKACB was found to phosphorylate XLF (a Nej1 human homolog) at S263, a corresponding residue of the yeast Nej1 S298. Together, our results uncover a new and conserved mechanism for Tpk1 and PRKACB in phosphorylating Nej1 (or XLF), which is critically required for NHEJ repair.	The conserved Tpk1 regulates non-homologous end joining double-strand break repair by phosphorylation of Nej1, a homolog of the human XLF.	Nucleic acids research
34232997	Newly synthesized mRNA is translated during its export through the nuclear pore complex, when its 5'-cap structure is still bound by the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), a heterodimer of cap-binding protein (CBP) 80 and CBP20. Despite its critical role in mRNA surveillance, the mechanism by which CBC-dependent translation (CT) is regulated remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the CT initiation factor (CTIF) is tethered in a translationally incompetent manner to the perinuclear region by the DEAD-box helicase 19B (DDX19B). DDX19B hands over CTIF to CBP80, which is associated with the 5'-cap of a newly exported mRNA. The resulting CBP80-CTIF complex then initiates CT in the perinuclear region. We also show that impeding the interaction between CTIF and DDX19B leads to uncontrolled CT throughout the cytosol, consequently dysregulating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Altogether, our data provide molecular evidence supporting the importance of tight control of local translation in the perinuclear region.	Translation mediated by the nuclear cap-binding complex is confined to the perinuclear region via a CTIF-DDX19B interaction.	Nucleic acids research
32366358	Adaptation to nutrient availability is crucial for survival. Upon nutritional stress, such as during prolonged fasting or cold exposure, organisms need to balance the feeding of tissues and the maintenance of body temperature. The mechanisms that regulate the adaptation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a key organ for non-shivering thermogenesis, to variations in nutritional state are not known. Here we report that specific deletion of the activin receptor ALK7 in BAT resulted in fasting-induced hypothermia due to exaggerated catabolic activity in brown adipocytes. After overnight fasting, BAT lacking ALK7 showed increased expression of genes responsive to nutrient stress, including the upstream regulator KLF15, aminoacid catabolizing enzymes, notably proline dehydrogenase (POX), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), as well as markedly reduced lipid droplet size. In agreement with this, ligand stimulation of ALK7 suppressed POX and KLF15 expression in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Treatment of mutant mice with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 restored KLF15 and POX expression levels in mutant BAT, suggesting that loss of BAT ALK7 results in excessive activation of glucocorticoid signaling upon fasting. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway downstream of ALK7 which regulates the adaptation of BAT to nutrient availability by limiting nutrient stress-induced overactivation of catabolic responses in brown adipocytes.	Control of brown adipose tissue adaptation to nutrient stress by the activin receptor ALK7.	eLife
32369015	The intermediate filament protein keratin 14 (K14) provides vital structural support in basal keratinocytes of epidermis. Recent studies evidenced a role for K14-dependent disulfide bonding in the organization and dynamics of keratin IFs in skin keratinocytes. Here we report that knock-in mice harboring a cysteine-to-alanine substitution at Krt14's codon 373 (C373A) exhibit alterations in disulfide-bonded K14 species and a barrier defect secondary to enhanced proliferation, faster transit time and altered differentiation in epidermis. A proteomics screen identified 14-3-3 as K14 interacting proteins. Follow-up studies showed that YAP1, a transcriptional effector of Hippo signaling regulated by 14-3-3sigma in skin keratinocytes, shows aberrant subcellular partitioning and function in differentiating Krt14 C373A keratinocytes. Residue C373 in K14, which is conserved in a subset of keratins, is revealed as a novel regulator of keratin organization and YAP function in early differentiating keratinocytes, with an impact on cell mechanics, homeostasis and barrier function in epidermis.	Keratin 14-dependent disulfides regulate epidermal homeostasis and barrier function via 14-3-3sigma and YAP1.	eLife
32391792	Endosomes and lysosomes harbor Rab5 and Rab7 on their surface as key proteins involved in their identity, biogenesis, and fusion. Rab activation requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is Mon1-Ccz1 for Rab7. During endosome maturation, Rab5 is replaced by Rab7, though the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular determinants for Rab conversion in vivo and in vitro, and reconstitute Rab7 activation with yeast and metazoan proteins. We show (i) that Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, (ii) that membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent Rab7 activation and Rab7-dependent membrane fusion, and (iii) that this process is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery of the endosomal Rab cascade and a novel regulatory mechanism controlling this pathway.	A conserved and regulated mechanism drives endosomal Rab transition.	eLife
32420875	Modulating cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) Ca(2+)-release channels is a universal signaling pathway that regulates numerous cell-physiological processes. Whereas much is known regarding regulation of InsP3R activity by cytoplasmic ligands and processes, its regulation by ER-luminal Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]ER) is poorly understood and controversial. We discovered that the InsP3R is regulated by a peripheral membrane-associated ER-luminal protein that strongly inhibits the channel in the presence of high, physiological [Ca(2+)]ER. The widely-expressed Ca(2+)-binding protein annexin A1 (ANXA1) is present in the nuclear envelope lumen and, through interaction with a luminal region of the channel, can modify high-[Ca(2+)]ER inhibition of InsP3R activity. Genetic knockdown of ANXA1 expression enhanced global and local elementary InsP3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling events. Thus, [Ca(2+)]ER is a major regulator of InsP3R channel activity and InsP3R-mediated [Ca(2+)]i signaling in cells by controlling an interaction of the channel with a peripheral membrane-associated Ca(2+)-binding protein, likely ANXA1.	ER-luminal [Ca(2+)] regulation of InsP3 receptor gating mediated by an ER-luminal peripheral Ca(2+)-binding protein.	eLife
32427102	Progressive telomere shortening during lifespan is associated with restriction of cell proliferation, genome instability and aging. Apoptosis and senescence are the two major outcomes upon irreversible cellular damage. Here, we show a transition of these two cell fates during aging of telomerase deficient zebrafish. In young telomerase mutants, proliferative tissues exhibit DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis, but no senescence. However, these tissues in older animals display loss of cellularity and senescence becomes predominant. Tissue alterations are accompanied by a pro-proliferative stimulus mediated by AKT signaling. Upon AKT activation, FoxO transcription factors are phosphorylated and translocated out of the nucleus. This results in reduced SOD2 expression causing an increase of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations induce p15/16 growth arrest and senescence. We propose that, upon telomere shortening, early apoptosis leads to cell depletion and insufficient compensatory proliferation. Following tissue damage, the mTOR/AKT is activated causing mitochondrial dysfunction and p15/16-dependent senescence.	Opposing p53 and mTOR/AKT promote an in vivo switch from apoptosis to senescence upon telomere shortening in zebrafish.	eLife
32452382	Studies have suggested that amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic homeostasis, but the evidence has not been consistent. In particular, signaling pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding protein involved in Huntington's disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and increased synaptic density. Ablating in vivo HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.	Presynaptic APP levels and synaptic homeostasis are regulated by Akt phosphorylation of huntingtin.	eLife
32459171	Integrating differential RNA and miRNA expression during neuronal lineage induction of human embryonic stem cells we identified miR-934, a primate-specific miRNA that displays a stage-specific expression pattern during progenitor expansion and early neuron generation. We demonstrate the biological relevance of this finding by comparison with data from early to mid-gestation human cortical tissue. Further we find that miR-934 directly controls progenitor to neuroblast transition and impacts on neurite growth of newborn neurons. In agreement, miR-934 targets are involved in progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation whilst miR-934 inhibition results in profound global transcriptome changes associated with neurogenesis, axonogenesis, neuronal migration and neurotransmission. Interestingly, miR-934 inhibition affects the expression of genes associated with the subplate zone, a transient compartment most prominent in primates that emerges during early corticogenesis. Our data suggest that mir-934 is a novel regulator of early human neurogenesis with potential implications for a species-specific evolutionary role in brain function.	MicroRNA-934 is a novel primate-specific small non-coding RNA with neurogenic function during early development.	eLife
32469309	Yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1 stimulates translation initiation, particularly of mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. Interactions of the Ded1 N-terminal domain (NTD) with eIF4A, and Ded1-CTD with eIF4G, subunits of eIF4F, enhance Ded1 unwinding activity and stimulation of preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly in vitro. However, the importance of these interactions, and of Ded1-eIF4E association, in vivo were poorly understood. We identified separate amino acid clusters in the Ded1-NTD required for binding to eIF4A or eIF4E in vitro. Disrupting each cluster selectively impairs native Ded1 association with eIF4A or eIF4E, and reduces cell growth, polysome assembly, and translation of reporter mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. It also impairs Ded1 stimulation of PIC assembly on a structured mRNA in vitro. Ablating Ded1 interactions with eIF4A/eIF4E unveiled a requirement for the Ded1-CTD for robust initiation. Thus, Ded1 function in vivo is stimulated by independent interactions of its NTD with eIF4E and eIF4A, and its CTD with eIF4G.	Distinct interactions of eIF4A and eIF4E with RNA helicase Ded1 stimulate translation in vivo.	eLife
32484436	MCL1 has critical antiapoptotic functions and its levels are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation and degradation, but mechanisms that drive this degradation, particularly in solid tumors, remain to be established. We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not strongly sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with MARCH5 genomic loss.	MARCH5 mediates NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation driven by kinase inhibitors and integrated stress response activation.	eLife
32510323	EDC4 is a core component of processing (P)-bodies that binds the DCP2 decapping enzyme and stimulates mRNA decay. EDC4 also interacts with mammalian MARF1, a recently identified endoribonuclease that promotes oogenesis and contains a number of RNA binding domains, including two RRMs and multiple LOTUS domains. How EDC4 regulates MARF1 action and the identity of MARF1 target mRNAs is not known. Our transcriptome-wide analysis identifies bona fide MARF1 target mRNAs and indicates that MARF1 predominantly binds their 3' UTRs via its LOTUS domains to promote their decay. We also show that a MARF1 RRM plays an essential role in enhancing its endonuclease activity. Importantly, we establish that EDC4 impairs MARF1 activity by preventing its LOTUS domains from binding target mRNAs. Thus, EDC4 not only serves as an enhancer of mRNA turnover that binds DCP2, but also as a repressor that binds MARF1 to prevent the decay of MARF1 target mRNAs.

32369018	Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, also called insulin-like growth factor two receptor (CIM6P/IGF2R), plays important roles in growth and development, but is also extensively expressed in the mature nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus, where its functions are largely unknown. One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.

32515734	Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are proteins whose expression is normally restricted to germ cells yet aberrantly activated in tumors, where their functions remain relatively cryptic. Here we report that ZNF165, a CT antigen frequently expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), associates with SMAD3 to modulate transcription of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-dependent genes and thereby promote growth and survival of human TNBC cells. In addition, we identify the KRAB zinc finger protein, ZNF446, and its associated tripartite motif protein, TRIM27, as obligate components of the ZNF165-SMAD3 complex that also support tumor cell viability. Importantly, we find that TRIM27 alone is necessary for ZNF165 transcriptional activity and is required for TNBC tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. Our findings indicate that aberrant expression of a testis-specific transcription factor is sufficient to co-opt somatic transcriptional machinery to drive a pro-tumorigenic gene expression program in TNBC.	The testis protein ZNF165 is a SMAD3 cofactor that coordinates oncogenic TGFbeta signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.	eLife
32538779	The DNA damage response (DDR) is a highly orchestrated process but how double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are initially recognized is unclear. Here, we show that polymerized SIRT6 deacetylase recognizes DSBs and potentiates the DDR in human and mouse cells. First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then, K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to gammaH2AX, allowing its retention on and subsequent remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that mimics hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of SIRT1 deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action between SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair in humans and mice.	Synergy between SIRT1 and SIRT6 helps recognize DNA breaks and potentiates the DNA damage response and repair in humans and mice.	eLife
32530419	Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic signals regulate the state and fate of stem and progenitor cells. Recent advances in metabolomics illustrate that various metabolic pathways are also important in regulating stem cell fate. However, our understanding of the metabolic control of the state and fate of progenitor cells is in its infancy. Using Drosophila hematopoietic organ: lymph gland, we demonstrate that Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) is essential for the differentiation of blood cell progenitors. In the absence of FAO, the progenitors are unable to differentiate and exhibit altered histone acetylation. Interestingly, acetate supplementation rescues both histone acetylation and the differentiation defects. We further show that the CPT1/whd (withered), the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, is transcriptionally regulated by Jun-Kinase (JNK), which has been previously implicated in progenitor differentiation. Our study thus reveals how the cellular signaling machinery integrates with the metabolic cue to facilitate the differentiation program.	Fatty acid beta-oxidation is required for the differentiation of larval hematopoietic progenitors in Drosophila.	eLife
32515350	The genome-scale transcriptional programs that specify the mammalian trachea and esophagus are unknown. Though NKX2-1 and SOX2 are hypothesized to be co-repressive master regulators of tracheoesophageal fates, this is untested at a whole transcriptomic scale and their downstream networks remain unidentified. By combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with bulk RNA-sequencing of Nkx2-1 mutants and NKX2-1 ChIP-sequencing in mouse embryos, we delineate the NKX2-1 transcriptional program in tracheoesophageal specification, and discover that the majority of the tracheal and esophageal transcriptome is NKX2-1 independent. To decouple the NKX2-1 transcriptional program from regulation by SOX2, we interrogate the expression of newly-identified tracheal and esophageal markers in Sox2/Nkx2-1 compound mutants. Finally, we discover that NKX2-1 binds directly to Shh and Wnt7b and regulates their expression to control mesenchymal specification to cartilage and smooth muscle, coupling epithelial identity with mesenchymal specification. These findings create a new framework for understanding early tracheoesophageal fate specification at the genome-wide level.

32579110	We have previously demonstrated that checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) is a critical negative regulator of androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth, and androgen sensitivity. We have now uncovered that the AR directly interacts with CHK2 and ionizing radiation (IR) increases this interaction. This IR-induced increase in AR-CHK2 interactions requires AR phosphorylation and CHK2 kinase activity. PCa associated CHK2 mutants with impaired kinase activity reduced IR-induced AR-CHK2 interactions. The destabilization of AR - CHK2 interactions induced by CHK2 variants impairs CHK2 negative regulation of cell growth. CHK2 depletion increases transcription of DNAPK and RAD54, increases clonogenic survival, and increases resolution of DNA double strand breaks. The data support a model where CHK2 sequesters the AR through direct binding decreasing AR transcription and suppressing PCa cell growth. CHK2 mutation or loss of expression thereby leads to increased AR transcriptional activity and survival in response to DNA damage.	AR phosphorylation and CHK2 kinase activity regulates IR-stabilized AR-CHK2 interaction and prostate cancer survival.	eLife
32614325	Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane regulate essential cellular activities including protein quality control, calcium flux, and sterol homeostasis. At least 25 different, transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing E3s are predicted to be ER-localised, but for most their organisation and cellular roles remain poorly defined. Using a comparative proteomic workflow, we mapped over 450 protein-protein interactions for 21 stably expressed, full-length E3s. Bioinformatic analysis linked ER-E3s and their interactors to multiple homeostatic, regulatory, and metabolic pathways. Among these were four membrane-embedded interactors of RNF26, a polytopic E3 whose abundance is auto-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. RNF26 co-assembles with TMEM43, ENDOD1, TMEM33 and TMED1 to form a complex capable of modulating innate immune signalling through the cGAS-STING pathway. This RNF26 complex represents a new modulatory axis of STING and innate immune signalling at the ER membrane. Collectively, these data reveal the broad scope of regulation and differential functionalities mediated by ER-E3s for both membrane-tethered and cytoplasmic processes.

32633716	Organ growth and size are finely tuned by intrinsic and extrinsic signaling molecules. In Drosophila, the BMP family member Dpp is produced in a limited set of imaginal disc cells and functions as a classic morphogen to regulate pattern and growth by diffusing throughout imaginal discs. However, the role of TGFbeta/Activin-like ligands in disc growth control remains ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses canonical dSmad2-mediated signaling to regulate wing size. We propose that Myo is a myokine that helps mediate an allometric relationship between muscles and their associated appendages.

32644041	Endogenous circadian clocks have evolved to anticipate 24 hr rhythms in environmental demands. Recent studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruption is a major risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders in humans. Conversely, alterations in energy state can disrupt circadian rhythms of behavior and physiology, creating a vicious circle of metabolic dysfunction. How peripheral energy state affects diurnal food intake, however, is still poorly understood. We here show that the adipokine adiponectin (ADIPOQ) regulates diurnal feeding rhythms through clocks in energy regulatory centers of the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Adipoq-deficient mice show increased rest phase food intake associated with disrupted transcript rhythms of clock and appetite-regulating genes in the MBH. ADIPOQ regulates MBH clocks via AdipoR1-mediated upregulation of the core clock gene Bmal1. BMAL1, in turn, controls expression of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the MBH. Together, these data reveal a systemic metabolic circuit to regulate central circadian clocks and energy intake.	An adipokine feedback regulating diurnal food intake rhythms in mice.	eLife
32657270	Genome-wide association studies identified the BIN1 locus as a leading modulator of genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One limitation in understanding BIN1's contribution to AD is its unknown function in the brain. AD-associated BIN1 variants are generally noncoding and likely change expression. Here, we determined the effects of increasing expression of the major neuronal isoform of human BIN1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Higher BIN1 induced network hyperexcitability on multielectrode arrays, increased frequency of synaptic transmission, and elevated calcium transients, indicating that increasing BIN1 drives greater neuronal activity. In exploring the mechanism of these effects on neuronal physiology, we found that BIN1 interacted with L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) and that BIN1-LVGCC interactions were modulated by Tau in rat hippocampal neurons and mouse brain. Finally, Tau reduction prevented BIN1-induced network hyperexcitability. These data shed light on BIN1's neuronal function and suggest that it may contribute to Tau-dependent hyperexcitability in AD.

32662770	Peroxiredoxins are H2O2 scavenging enzymes that also carry out H2O2 signaling and chaperone functions. In yeast, the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1 is required for both promoting resistance to H2O2 and extending lifespan upon caloric restriction. We show here that Tsa1 effects both these functions not by scavenging H2O2, but by repressing the nutrient signaling Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway at the level of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme. Tsa1 stimulates sulfenylation of cysteines in the PKA catalytic subunit by H2O2 and a significant proportion of the catalytic subunits are glutathionylated on two cysteine residues. Redox modification of the conserved Cys243 inhibits the phosphorylation of a conserved Thr241 in the kinase activation loop and enzyme activity, and preventing Thr241 phosphorylation can overcome the H2O2 sensitivity of Tsa1-deficient cells. Results support a model of aging where nutrient signaling pathways constitute hubs integrating information from multiple aging-related conduits, including a peroxiredoxin-dependent response to H2O2.

32697192	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs plethora of mechanisms to hijack the host defence machinery for its successful survival, proliferation and persistence. Here, we show that Mtb upregulates one of the key epigenetic modulators, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), which upon infection translocate to the nucleus and deacetylates histone H3K18, thus modulating the host transcriptome leading to enhanced macrophage activation. Furthermore, in Mtb specific T cells, SIRT2 deacetylates NFkappaB-p65 at K310 to modulate T helper cell differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 restricts the intracellular growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains of Mtb and enhances the efficacy of front line anti-TB drug Isoniazid in the murine model of infection. SIRT2 inhibitor-treated mice display reduced bacillary load, decreased disease pathology and increased Mtb-specific protective immune responses.

32720893	During endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), the cytoplasmic enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is proposed to remove N-glycans from misfolded N-glycoproteins after their retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol. We previously reported that NGLY1 regulates Drosophila BMP signaling in a tissue-specific manner (Galeone et al., 2017). Here, we establish the Drosophila Dpp and its mouse ortholog BMP4 as biologically relevant targets of NGLY1 and find, unexpectedly, that NGLY1-mediated deglycosylation of misfolded BMP4 is required for its retrotranslocation. Accumulation of misfolded BMP4 in the ER results in ER stress and prompts the ER recruitment of NGLY1. The ER-associated NGLY1 then deglycosylates misfolded BMP4 molecules to promote their retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation, thereby allowing properly-folded BMP4 molecules to proceed through the secretory pathway and activate signaling in other cells. Our study redefines the role of NGLY1 during ERAD and suggests that impaired BMP4 signaling might underlie some of the NGLY1 deficiency patient phenotypes.

32749219	R-spondin1 (Rspo1) has been featured as a Wnt agonist, serving as a potent niche factor for stem cells in many tissues. Here we unveil a novel role of Rspo1 in promoting estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) expression, hence regulating the output of steroid hormone signaling in the mouse mammary gland. This action of Rspo1 relies on the receptor Lgr4 and intracellular cAMP-PKA signaling, yet is independent of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. These mechanisms were reinforced by genetic evidence. Luminal cells-specific knockout of Rspo1 results in decreased Esr1 expression and reduced mammary side branches. In contrast, luminal cells-specific knockout of Wnt4, while attenuating basal cell Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activities, enhances Esr1 expression. Our data reveal a novel Wnt-independent role of Rspo1, in which Rspo1 acts as a bona fide GPCR activator eliciting intracellular cAMP signaling. The identification of Rspo1-ERalpha signaling axis may have a broad implication in estrogen-associated diseases.

32795391	Intracellular transport undergoes remodeling upon cell differentiation, which involves cell type-specific regulators. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible kinase (BMP2K) has been potentially implicated in endocytosis and cell differentiation but its molecular functions remained unknown. We discovered that its longer (L) and shorter (S) splicing variants regulate erythroid differentiation in a manner unexplainable by their involvement in AP-2 adaptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, both variants interact with SEC16A and could localize to the juxtanuclear secretory compartment. Variant-specific depletion approach showed that BMP2K isoforms constitute a BMP2K-L/S regulatory system that controls the distribution of SEC16A and SEC24B as well as SEC31A abundance at COPII assemblies. Finally, we found L to promote and S to restrict autophagic degradation and erythroid differentiation. Hence, we propose that BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S differentially regulate abundance and distribution of COPII assemblies as well as autophagy, possibly thereby fine-tuning erythroid differentiation.	Splicing variation of BMP2K balances abundance of COPII assemblies and autophagic degradation in erythroid cells.	eLife
32804079	Molecular-glue degraders mediate interactions between target proteins and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause selective protein degradation. Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12 substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death. Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a 5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.

32838837	Endothelial Tie2 signaling plays a pivotal role in vascular barrier maintenance at baseline and after injury. We previously demonstrated that a sharp drop in Tie2 expression observed across various murine models of critical illnesses is associated with increased vascular permeability and mortality. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain shedding has recently been recognized as a possible mechanism for Tie2 downregulation in sepsis. Here, we identified the exact MMP14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain cleavage sites and could show that pharmacological MMP14 blockade in experimental murine sepsis exerts barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects predominantly through the attenuation of Tie2 cleavage to improve survival both in a pre-treatment and rescue approach. Overall, we show that protecting Tie2 shedding might offer a new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of septic vascular leakage.

32831175	Most of peroxisomal matrix proteins including a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-decomposing enzyme, catalase, are imported in a peroxisome-targeting signal type-1 (PTS1)-dependent manner. However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H2O2 in mammalian cells. The H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively impairs in vitro the interaction of catalase with the Pex14-Pex5 complex. A phosphomimetic mutant Pex14-S232D elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H2O2. We thus suggest that the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.	The peroxisome counteracts oxidative stresses by suppressing catalase import via Pex14 phosphorylation.	eLife
32844749	Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer metastasis. Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7 exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397 phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240 methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.	Arginine methylation of SHANK2 by PRMT7 promotes human breast cancer metastasis through activating endosomal FAK signalling.	eLife
32886065	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular respiration that can promote oxidative stress and damage cellular proteins and lipids. One canonical role of ROS is to defend the cell against invading bacterial and viral pathogens. Curiously, some viruses, including herpesviruses, thrive despite the induction of ROS, suggesting that ROS are beneficial for the virus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that ROS impaired interferon response during murine herpesvirus infection and that the inhibition occurred downstream of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We further demonstrated that ROS suppressed the type I interferon response by oxidizing Cysteine 147 on murine stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an ER-associated protein that mediates interferon response after cytoplasmic DNA sensing. This inhibited STING polymerization and activation of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that redox regulation of Cysteine 147 of mouse STING, which is equivalent to Cysteine 148 of human STING, controls interferon production. Together, our findings reveal that ROS orchestrates anti-viral immune responses, which can be exploited by viruses to evade cellular defenses.	Reactive oxygen species oxidize STING and suppress interferon production.	eLife
32894219	C1q plays a key role as a recognition molecule in the immune system, driving autocatalytic complement cascade activation and acting as an opsonin. We have previously reported a non-immune role of complement C1q modulating the migration and fate of human neural stem cells (hNSC); however, the mechanism underlying these effects has not yet been identified. Here, we show for the first time that C1q acts as a functional hNSC ligand, inducing intracellular signaling to control cell behavior. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we identified five transmembrane C1q signaling/receptor candidates in hNSC (CD44, GPR62, BAI1, c-MET, and ADCY5). We further investigated the interaction between C1q and CD44 , demonstrating that CD44 mediates C1q induced hNSC signaling and chemotaxis in vitro, and hNSC migration and functional repair in vivo after spinal cord injury. These results reveal a receptor-mediated mechanism for C1q modulation of NSC behavior and show that modification of C1q receptor expression can expand the therapeutic window for hNSC transplantation.

32985974	APOBEC3B (A3B)-catalyzed DNA cytosine deamination contributes to the overall mutational landscape in breast cancer. Molecular mechanisms responsible for A3B upregulation in cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that a single E2F cis-element mediates repression in normal cells and that expression is activated by its mutational disruption in a reporter construct or the endogenous A3B gene. The same E2F site is required for A3B induction by polyomavirus T antigen indicating a shared molecular mechanism. Proteomic and biochemical experiments demonstrate the binding of wildtype but not mutant E2F promoters by repressive PRC1.6/E2F6 and DREAM/E2F4 complexes. Knockdown and overexpression studies confirm the involvement of these repressive complexes in regulating A3B expression. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that A3B expression is suppressed in normal cells by repressive E2F complexes and that viral or mutational disruption of this regulatory network triggers overexpression in breast cancer and provides fuel for tumor evolution.

33001025	Aberrant HOXA9 expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, notably those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut and Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.

33006314	Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previously, we found that a lncRNA named GAS5 in human could negatively regulate the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether GAS5 affects osteoblast differentiation and whether GAS5 is associated with osteoporosis. Our current research found that GAS5 was decreased in the bones and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically, GAS5 promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade SMAD7 mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were observed in Gas5 heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic supplement of Gas5-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, GAS5 promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against osteoporosis.

33030429	Life of sexually reproducing organisms starts with the fusion of the haploid egg and sperm gametes to form the genome of a new diploid organism. Using the newly fertilized Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, we show that the mitotic Polo-like kinase PLK-1 phosphorylates the lamin LMN-1 to promote timely lamina disassembly and subsequent merging of the parental genomes into a single nucleus after mitosis. Expression of non-phosphorylatable versions of LMN-1, which affect lamina depolymerization during mitosis, is sufficient to prevent the mixing of the parental chromosomes into a single nucleus in daughter cells. Finally, we recapitulate lamina depolymerization by PLK-1 in vitro demonstrating that LMN-1 is a direct PLK-1 target. Our findings indicate that the timely removal of lamin is essential for the merging of parental chromosomes at the beginning of life in C. elegans and possibly also in humans, where a defect in this process might be fatal for embryo development.

33047671	Meiotic recombination starts with the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic locations that correspond to PRDM9-binding sites. The molecular steps occurring from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are unknown. Using proteomic approaches to find PRDM9 partners, we identified HELLS, a member of the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers. Upon functional analyses during mouse male meiosis, we demonstrated that HELLS is required for PRDM9 binding and DSB activity at PRDM9 sites. However, HELLS is not required for DSB activity at PRDM9-independent sites. HELLS is also essential for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) enrichment at PRDM9 sites. Analyses of 5hmC in mice deficient for SPO11, which catalyzes DSB formation, and in PRDM9 methyltransferase deficient mice reveal that 5hmC is triggered at DSB-prone sites upon PRDM9 binding and histone modification, but independent of DSB activity. These findings highlight the complex regulation of the chromatin and epigenetic environments at PRDM9-specified hotspots.	PRDM9 activity depends on HELLS and promotes local 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enrichment.	eLife
33078707	The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental handle in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, in which we uncover the mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that sustained beta-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from life-shortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation. Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long periods without deleterious effects on longevity.	A feedback loop governs the relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity.	eLife
33107819	Brown adipose tissue is a metabolically beneficial organ capable of dissipating chemical energy into heat, thereby increasing energy expenditure. Here, we identify Dot1l, the only known H3K79 methyltransferase, as an interacting partner of Zc3h10 that transcriptionally activates the Ucp1 promoter and other BAT genes. Through a direct interaction, Dot1l is recruited by Zc3h10 to the promoter regions of thermogenic genes to function as a coactivator by methylating H3K79. We also show that Dot1l is induced during brown fat cell differentiation and by cold exposure and that Dot1l and its H3K79 methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dot1l ablation in mice using Ucp1-Cre prevents activation of Ucp1 and other target genes to reduce thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure, promoting adiposity. Hence, Dot1l plays a critical role in the thermogenic program and may present as a future target for obesity therapeutics.

33108271	Cell cycle is a cellular process that is subject to stringent control. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge of proteins controlling the cell cycle, very little is known about the molecular role of lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) in cell-cycle progression. By performing genome-wide transcriptome analyses in cell-cycle-synchronized cells, we observed cell-cycle phase-specific induction of >2000 lncRNAs. Further, we demonstrate that an S-phase-upregulated lncRNA, SUNO1, facilitates cell-cycle progression by promoting YAP1-mediated gene expression. SUNO1 facilitates the cell-cycle-specific transcription of WTIP, a positive regulator of YAP1, by promoting the co-activator, DDX5-mediated stabilization of RNA polymerase II on chromatin. Finally, elevated SUNO1 levels are associated with poor cancer prognosis and tumorigenicity, implying its pro-survival role. Thus, we demonstrate the role of a S-phase up-regulated lncRNA in cell-cycle progression via modulating the expression of genes controlling cell proliferation.	The S-phase-induced lncRNA SUNO1 promotes cell proliferation by controlling YAP1/Hippo signaling pathway.	eLife
33112233	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often associated with polysomes, indicating coding potential. However, only a handful of endogenous proteins encoded by putative lncRNAs have been identified and assigned a function. Here, we report the discovery of a putative gastrointestinal-tract-specific lncRNA (LINC00675) that is regulated by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 and encodes a conserved small protein of 79 amino acids which we termed FORCP (FOXA1-Regulated Conserved Small Protein). FORCP transcript is undetectable in most cell types but is abundant in well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC) cells where it functions to inhibit proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorigenesis. The epitope-tagged and endogenous FORCP protein predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to ER stress, FORCP depletion results in decreased apoptosis. Our findings on the initial characterization of FORCP demonstrate that FORCP is a novel, conserved small protein encoded by a mis-annotated lncRNA that regulates apoptosis and tumorigenicity in well-differentiated CRC cells.

33150865	Macrophages are critically involved in not only immune and inflammatory responses but also maintenance of metabolic fitness of organisms. Combined genetic deficiency of three clusters in the miR-17~92 family drastically shifted macrophage phenotypes toward the inflammatory spectrum characterized by heightened production of pro-inflammatory mediator TNF and diminished expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Consequently, macrophages residing in the adipose tissues from myeloid-specific miRNA triple knockout mice spontaneously developed inflammatory phenotypes and displayed alterations of overall physiological conditions as evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs sustained IL-10 production by promoting transcription of the Fos gene, which is secondary to downregulation of Fos by transcription factor YY1, a direct target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs. Together, these results identified miR-17~92 family miRNAs as crucial regulators of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and exemplified how macrophage-intrinsic regulatory circuit exerted impactful influence on general physiology.

33179593	Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in hepatocytes plays a key role in plasma clearance of circulating LDL and in whole body cholesterol homeostasis. The trafficking of LDLR is highly regulated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation. Current studies focus on its endocytosis and degradation. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its endosomal recycling are largely unknown. We found that BLOS1, a shared subunit of BLOC-1 and BORC, is involved in LDLR endosomal recycling. Loss of BLOS1 leads to less membrane LDLR and impairs LDL clearance from plasma in hepatocyte-specific BLOS1 knockout mice. BLOS1 interacts with kinesin-3 motor KIF13A, and BLOS1 acts as a new adaptor for kinesin-2 motor KIF3 to coordinate kinesin-3 and kinesin-2 during the long-range transport of recycling endosomes (REs) to plasma membrane along microtubule tracks to overcome hurdles at microtubule intersections. This provides new insights into RE's anterograde transport and the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia.	BLOS1 mediates kinesin switch during endosomal recycling of LDL receptor.	eLife
33185190	The palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ZDHHC14 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is the only PAT predicted to bind Type-I PDZ domain-containing proteins. However, ZDHHC14's neuronal roles are unknown. Here, we identify the PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) PSD93 as a direct ZDHHC14 interactor and substrate. PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes to the axon initial segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14's importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.

33185187	Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based on fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator, which marks different stages of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density. Unexpectedly, one top hit was Traf3, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB signaling that has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of Traf3 specifically activates noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, by blocking entry into quiescence.	Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling as a regulator of density-dependent proliferation.	eLife
33206046	Casein kinases are a large family of intracellular serine/threonine kinases that control a variety of cellular signaling functions. Here we report that a member of casein kinase 1 family, casein kinase 1G2, CSNK1G2, binds and inhibits the activation of receptor-interacting kinase 3, RIPK3, thereby attenuating RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. The binding of CSNK1G2 to RIPK3 is triggered by auto-phosphorylation at serine 211/threonine 215 sites in its C-terminal domain. CSNK1G2-knockout mice showed significantly enhanced necroptosis response and premature aging of their testis, a phenotype that was rescued by either double knockout of the Ripk3 gene or feeding the animal with a RIPK1 kinase inhibitor-containing diet. Moreover, CSNK1G2 is also co-expressed with RIPK3 in human testis, and the necroptosis activation marker phospho-MLKL was observed in the testis of old (>80) but not young men, indicating that the testis-aging program carried out by the RIPK3-mediated and CSNK1G2-attenuated necroptosis is evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.

33205750	Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs and also regulates the expression of a wide range of physiological transcripts. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases form an hetero-hexameric ring that is part of several macromolecular complexes such as INO80, SWR1, and R2TP. Interestingly, RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is required for NMD activation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that DHX34, an RNA helicase regulating NMD initiation, directly interacts with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in vitro and in cells. Cryo-EM reveals that DHX34 induces extensive changes in the N-termini of every RUVBL2 subunit in the complex, stabilizing a conformation that does not bind nucleotide and thereby down-regulates ATP hydrolysis of the complex. Using ATPase-deficient mutants, we find that DHX34 acts exclusively on the RUVBL2 subunits. We propose a model, where DHX34 acts to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of factors required to initiate the NMD response.

33226341	Nuclear export of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is intimately coupled to their synthesis. pre-mRNAs assemble into dynamic ribonucleoparticles as they are being transcribed, processed, and exported. The role of ubiquitylation in this process is increasingly recognized but, while a few E3 ligases have been shown to regulate nuclear export, evidence for deubiquitylases is currently lacking. Here we identified deubiquitylase Ubp15 as a regulator of nuclear export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ubp15 interacts with both RNA polymerase II and the nuclear pore complex, and its deletion reverts the nuclear export defect of E3 ligase Rsp5 mutants. The deletion of UBP15 leads to hyper-ubiquitylation of the main nuclear export receptor Mex67 and affects its association with THO, a complex coupling transcription to mRNA processing and involved in the recruitment of mRNA export factors to nascent transcripts. Collectively, our data support a role for Ubp15 in coupling transcription to mRNA export.	The deubiquitylase Ubp15 couples transcription to mRNA export.	eLife
33252038	Wnt signaling is downregulated in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and contributes to the block of differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms leading to its suppression are unknown and could pave the way toward novel therapeutic modalities. We demonstrate that EHMT2 suppresses canonical Wnt signaling by activating expression of the Wnt antagonist DKK1. Inhibition of EHMT2 expression or activity in human ERMS cell lines reduced DKK1 expression and elevated canonical Wnt signaling resulting in myogenic differentiation in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, EHMT2 impacted Sp1 and p300 enrichment at the DKK1 promoter. The reduced tumor growth upon EHMT2 deficiency was reversed by recombinant DKK1 or LGK974, which also inhibits Wnt signaling. Consistently, among 13 drugs targeting chromatin modifiers, EHMT2 inhibitors were highly effective in reducing ERMS cell viability. Our study demonstrates that ERMS cells are vulnerable to EHMT2 inhibitors and suggest that targeting the EHMT2-DKK1-beta-catenin node holds promise for differentiation therapy.

33264090	The dendritic cell receptor Clec9A facilitates processing of dead cell-derived antigens for cross-presentation and the induction of effective CD8(+) T cell immune responses. Here, we show that this process is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 and define a new ubiquitin-mediated mechanism for regulation of Clec9A, reflecting the unique properties of Clec9A as a receptor specialized for delivery of antigens for cross-presentation. We reveal RNF41 is a negative regulator of Clec9A and the cross-presentation of dead cell-derived antigens by mouse dendritic cells. Intriguingly, RNF41 regulates the downstream fate of Clec9A by directly binding and ubiquitinating the extracellular domains of Clec9A. At steady-state, RNF41 ubiquitination of Clec9A facilitates interactions with ER-associated proteins and degradation machinery to control Clec9A levels. However, Clec9A interactions are altered following dead cell uptake to favor antigen presentation. These findings provide important insights into antigen cross-presentation and have implications for development of approaches to modulate immune responses.

33317697	Mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis. In yeast, the phosphorylation of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 by casein kinase 2 is essential for mitophagy. This phosphorylation is counteracted by the yeast equivalent of the STRIPAK complex consisting of the PP2A-like protein phosphatase Ppg1 and Far3-7-8-9-10-11 (Far complex), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that two subpopulations of the Far complex reside in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, and play distinct roles; the former inhibits mitophagy via Atg32 dephosphorylation, and the latter regulates TORC2 signaling. Ppg1 and Far11 form a subcomplex, and Ppg1 activity is required for the assembling integrity of Ppg1-Far11-Far8. The Far complex preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32, and this interaction is weakened by mitophagy induction. Furthermore, the artificial tethering of Far8 to Atg32 prevents mitophagy. Taken together, the Ppg1-mediated Far complex formation and its dissociation from Atg32 are crucial for mitophagy regulation.	Association and dissociation between the mitochondrial Far complex and Atg32 regulate mitophagy.	eLife
33372657	Changes in available nutrients are inevitable events for most living organisms. Upon nutritional stress, several signaling pathways cooperate to change the transcription program through chromatin regulation to rewire cellular metabolism. In budding yeast, histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) acts as a marker of low glucose stress and regulates the transcription of nutritional stress-responsive genes. Understanding how this histone modification 'senses' external glucose changes remains elusive. Here, we show that Tda1, the yeast ortholog of human Nuak1, is a direct kinase for H3pT11 upon low glucose stress. Yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) directly phosphorylates Tda1 to govern Tda1 activity, while CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization. Collectively, AMPK and CK2 signaling converge on histone kinase Tda1 to link external low glucose stress to chromatin regulation.

33416495	Endothelial cell (EC) activation is an early hallmark in the pathogenesis of chronic vascular diseases. MicroRNA-181b (Mir181b) is an important anti-inflammatory mediator in the vascular endothelium affecting endotoxemia, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. Herein, we identify that the drug methotrexate (MTX) and its downstream metabolite adenosine exert anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular endothelium by targeting and activating Mir181b expression. Both systemic and endothelial-specific Mir181a2b2-deficient mice develop vascular inflammation, white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance in a diet-induced obesity model. Moreover, MTX attenuated diet-induced WAT inflammation, insulin resistance, and EC activation in a Mir181a2b2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MTX attenuated cytokine-induced EC activation through a unique adenosine-adenosine receptor A3-SMAD3/4-Mir181b signaling cascade. These findings establish an essential role of endothelial Mir181b in controlling vascular inflammation and that restoring Mir181b in ECs by high-dose MTX or adenosine signaling may provide a potential therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory therapy.

33438581	The ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3) is a ciliopathy G-protein which regulates the ciliary trafficking of several lipid-modified proteins. ARL3 is activated by its guanine exchange factor (GEF) ARL13B via an unresolved mechanism. BART is described as an ARL3 effector which has also been implicated in ciliopathies, although the role of its ARL3 interaction is unknown. Here, we show that, at physiological GTP:GDP levels, human ARL3GDP is weakly activated by ARL13B. However, BART interacts with nucleotide-free ARL3 and, in concert with ARL13B, efficiently activates ARL3. In addition, BART binds ARL3GTP and inhibits GTP dissociation, thereby stabilising the active G-protein; the binding of ARL3 effectors then releases BART. Finally, using live cell imaging, we show that BART accesses the primary cilium and colocalises with ARL13B. We propose a model wherein BART functions as a bona fide co-GEF for ARL3 and maintains the active ARL3GTP, until it is recycled by ARL3 effectors.	ARL3 activation requires the co-GEF BART and effector-mediated turnover.	eLife
33475086	The conserved MAP3K Dual-Leucine-Zipper Kinase (DLK) and Leucine-Zipper-bearing Kinase (LZK) can activate JNK via MKK4 or MKK7. These two MAP3Ks share similar biochemical activities and undergo auto-activation upon increased expression. Depending on cell-type and nature of insults DLK and LZK can induce pro-regenerative, pro-apoptotic or pro-degenerative responses, although the mechanistic basis of their action is not well understood. Here, we investigated these two MAP3Ks in cerebellar Purkinje cells using loss- and gain-of function mouse models. While loss of each or both kinases does not cause discernible defects in Purkinje cells, activating DLK causes rapid death and activating LZK leads to slow degeneration. Each kinase induces JNK activation and caspase-mediated apoptosis independent of each other. Significantly, deleting CELF2, which regulates alternative splicing of Map2k7, strongly attenuates Purkinje cell degeneration induced by LZK, but not DLK. Thus, controlling the activity levels of DLK and LZK is critical for neuronal survival and health.	Activation of MAP3K DLK and LZK in Purkinje cells causes rapid and slow degeneration depending on signaling strength.	eLife
33475085	PARP-7 (TiPARP) is a mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase whose protein substrates and biological activities are poorly understood. We observed that PARP7 mRNA levels are lower in ovarian cancer patient samples compared to non-cancerous tissue, but PARP-7 protein nonetheless contributes to several cancer-related biological endpoints in ovarian cancer cells (e.g. growth, migration). Global gene expression analyses in ovarian cancer cells subjected to PARP-7 depletion indicate biological roles for PARP-7 in cell-cell adhesion and gene regulation. To identify the MARylated substrates of PARP-7 in ovarian cancer cells, we developed an NAD(+) analog-sensitive approach, which we coupled with mass spectrometry to identify the PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome in ovarian cancer cells, including cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins. Specifically, we found that PARP-7 MARylates alpha-tubulin to promote microtubule instability, which may regulate ovarian cancer cell growth and motility. In sum, we identified an extensive PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome with important roles in cancer-related cellular phenotypes.	Identification of PARP-7 substrates reveals a role for MARylation in microtubule control in ovarian cancer cells.	eLife
33475084	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 7 (PARP-7) has emerged as a critically important member of a large enzyme family that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation in mammalian cells. PARP-7 is a critical regulator of the innate immune response. What remains unclear is the mechanism by which PARP-7 regulates this process, namely because the protein targets of PARP-7 mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) are largely unknown. Here, we combine chemical genetics, proximity labeling, and proteome-wide amino acid ADP-ribosylation site profiling for identifying the direct targets and sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation in a cellular context. We found that the inactive PARP family member, PARP-13-a critical regulator of the antiviral innate immune response-is a major target of PARP-7. PARP-13 is preferentially MARylated on cysteine residues in its RNA binding zinc finger domain. Proteome-wide ADP-ribosylation analysis reveals cysteine as a major MARylation acceptor of PARP-7. This study provides insight into PARP-7 targeting and MARylation site preference.	Chemical genetics and proteome-wide site mapping reveal cysteine MARylation by PARP-7 on immune-relevant protein targets.	eLife
33481703	In budding yeast, the mitotic exit network (MEN), a GTPase signaling cascade, integrates spatial and temporal cues to promote exit from mitosis. This signal integration requires transmission of a signal generated on the cytoplasmic face of spindle pole bodies (SPBs; yeast equivalent of centrosomes) to the nucleolus, where the MEN effector protein Cdc14 resides. Here, we show that the MEN activating signal at SPBs is relayed to Cdc14 in the nucleolus through the dynamic localization of its terminal kinase complex Dbf2-Mob1. Cdc15, the protein kinase that activates Dbf2-Mob1 at SPBs, also regulates its nuclear access. Once in the nucleus, priming phosphorylation of Cfi1/Net1, the nucleolar anchor of Cdc14, by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 targets Dbf2-Mob1 to the nucleolus. Nucleolar Dbf2-Mob1 then phosphorylates Cfi1/Net1 and Cdc14, activating Cdc14. The kinase-primed transmission of the MEN signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus exemplifies how signaling cascades can bridge distant inputs and responses.

33507149	Derived from a common precursor cell, the balance between Th17 and Treg cells must be maintained within immune system to prevent autoimmune diseases. IL-1beta-mediated IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for Th17-cell biology. Fine-tuning of IL-1R signaling is controlled by two receptors, IL-1RI and IL-RII, IL-1R accessory protein, and IL-1R antagonist. We demonstrate that the decoy receptor, IL-1RII, is important for regulating IL-17 responses in TCR-stimulated CD4(+) T cells expressing functional IL-1RI via limiting IL-1beta responsiveness. IL-1RII expression is regulated by NFAT via its interaction with Foxp3. The NFAT/FOXP3 complex binds to the IL-1RII promoter and is critical for its transcription. Additionally, IL-1RII expression is dysregulated in CD4(+) T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, differential expression of IL-1Rs on activated CD4(+) T cells defines unique immunological features and a novel molecular mechanism underlies IL-1RII expression. These findings shed light on the modulatory effects of IL-1RII on Th17 responses.	Induction of the IL-1RII decoy receptor by NFAT/FOXP3 blocks IL-1beta-dependent response of Th17 cells.	eLife
33555257	The Hippo (Hpo) pathway regulates tissue growth in many animals. Multiple upstream components promote Hpo pathway activity, but the organization of these different inputs, the degree of crosstalk between them, and whether they are regulated in a distinct manner is not well understood. Kibra (Kib) activates the Hpo pathway by recruiting the core Hpo kinase cassette to the apical cortex. Here, we show that the Hpo pathway downregulates Drosophila Kib levels independently of Yorkie-mediated transcription. We find that Hpo signaling complex formation promotes Kib degradation via SCF(Slimb)-mediated ubiquitination, that this effect requires Merlin, Salvador, Hpo, and Warts, and that this mechanism functions independently of other upstream Hpo pathway activators. Moreover, Kib degradation appears patterned by differences in mechanical tension across the wing. We propose that Kib degradation mediated by Hpo pathway components and regulated by cytoskeletal tension serves to control Kib-driven Hpo pathway activation and ensure optimally scaled and patterned tissue growth.	Negative feedback couples Hippo pathway activation with Kibra degradation independent of Yorkie-mediated transcription.	eLife
33587037	Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play essential roles in silencing repetitive elements to promote fertility in metazoans. Studies in worms, flies, and mammals reveal that piRNAs are expressed in a sex-specific manner. However, the mechanisms underlying this sex-specific regulation are unknown. Here we identify SNPC-1.3, a male germline-enriched variant of a conserved subunit of the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex, as a male-specific piRNA transcription factor in Caenorhabditis elegans. SNPC-1.3 colocalizes with the core piRNA transcription factor, SNPC-4, in nuclear foci of the male germline. Binding of SNPC-1.3 at male piRNA loci drives spermatogenic piRNA transcription and requires SNPC-4. Loss of snpc-1.3 leads to depletion of male piRNAs and defects in male-dependent fertility. Furthermore, TRA-1, a master regulator of sex determination, binds to the snpc-1.3 promoter and represses its expression during oogenesis. Loss of TRA-1 targeting causes ectopic expression of snpc-1.3 and male piRNAs during oogenesis. Thus, sexually dimorphic regulation of snpc-1.3 expression coordinates male and female piRNA expression during germline development.	SNPC-1.3 is a sex-specific transcription factor that drives male piRNA expression in C. elegans.	eLife
33599613	The regulation of stem cell fate is poorly understood. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans lead to the hypothesis that a conserved cytoplasmic double-negative feedback loop consisting of the RNA-binding protein Trim71 and the let-7 microRNA controls the pluripotency and differentiation of stem cells. Although let-7-microRNA-mediated inhibition of Trim71 promotes differentiation, whether and how Trim71 regulates pluripotency and inhibits the let-7 microRNA are still unknown. Here, we show that Trim71 represses Ago2 mRNA translation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Blocking this repression leads to a specific post-transcriptional increase of mature let-7 microRNAs, resulting in let-7-dependent stemness defects and accelerated differentiation in the stem cells. These results not only support the Trim71-let-7-microRNA bi-stable switch model in controlling stem cell fate, but also reveal that repressing the conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs at the mature microRNA level by Ago2 availability is critical to maintaining pluripotency.	Repressing Ago2 mRNA translation by Trim71 maintains pluripotency through inhibiting let-7 microRNAs.	eLife
33616038	The committed step of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs when the pairs of Mcm2-7 replicative helicases that license each replication origin are activated. Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45, GINS, and likely additional proteins are recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). DDK phosphorylation of multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2-7 tails modulates the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher CtG multiplicity increases the frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with implications for control of replication origin efficiency and timing.	DDK regulates replication initiation by controlling the multiplicity of Cdc45-GINS binding to Mcm2-7.	eLife
33629656	The endothelium responds to numerous chemical and mechanical factors in regulating vascular tone, blood pressure, and blood flow. The endothelial volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechanosensitive and thereby sense fluid flow and hydrostatic pressure to regulate vascular function. Here, we show that the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8a, LRRC8A (SWELL1), is required for VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Endothelial LRRC8A regulates AKT-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling under basal, stretch, and shear-flow stimulation, forms a GRB2-Cav1-eNOS signaling complex, and is required for endothelial cell alignment to laminar shear flow. Endothelium-restricted Lrrc8a KO mice develop hypertension in response to chronic angiotensin-II infusion and exhibit impaired retinal blood flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of type 2 diabetes (T2D). These data demonstrate that LRRC8A regulates AKT-eNOS in endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in the setting of T2D.	The SWELL1-LRRC8 complex regulates endothelial AKT-eNOS signaling and vascular function.	eLife
33646120	Caenorhabditis elegans expresses human Werner syndrome protein (WRN) orthologs as two distinct proteins: MUT-7, with a 3'-5' exonuclease domain, and CeWRN-1, with helicase domains. How these domains cooperate remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the different contributions of MUT-7 and CeWRN-1 to 22G small interfering RNA (siRNA) synthesis and the plasticity of neuronal signaling. MUT-7 acts specifically in the cytoplasm to promote siRNA biogenesis and in the nucleus to associate with CeWRN-1. The import of siRNA by the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 promotes the loading of the heterochromatin-binding protein HP1 homolog HPL-2 onto specific loci. This heterochromatin complex represses the gene expression of the guanylyl cyclase ODR-1 to direct olfactory plasticity in C. elegans. Our findings suggest that the exonuclease and helicase domains of human WRN may act in concert to promote RNA-dependent loading into a heterochromatin complex, and the failure of this entire process reduces plasticity in postmitotic neurons.	C. elegans orthologs MUT-7/CeWRN-1 of Werner syndrome protein regulate neuronal plasticity.	eLife
33646118	The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates a coordinated anabolic program in response to growth-promoting signals. Paradoxically, recent studies indicate that mTORC1 can activate the transcription factor ATF4 through mechanisms distinct from its canonical induction by the integrated stress response (ISR). However, its broader roles as a downstream target of mTORC1 are unknown. Therefore, we directly compared ATF4-dependent transcriptional changes induced upon insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling to those activated by the ISR. In multiple mouse embryo fibroblast and human cancer cell lines, the mTORC1-ATF4 pathway stimulated expression of only a subset of the ATF4 target genes induced by the ISR, including genes involved in amino acid uptake, synthesis, and tRNA charging. We demonstrate that ATF4 is a metabolic effector of mTORC1 involved in both its established role in promoting protein synthesis and in a previously unappreciated function for mTORC1 in stimulating cellular cystine uptake and glutathione synthesis.	The mTORC1-mediated activation of ATF4 promotes protein and glutathione synthesis downstream of growth signals.	eLife
33661101	Fine control of protein stoichiometry at synapses underlies brain function and plasticity. How proteostasis is controlled independently for each type of synaptic protein in a synapse-specific and activity-dependent manner remains unclear. Here, we show that Susd4, a gene coding for a complement-related transmembrane protein, is expressed by many neuronal populations starting at the time of synapse formation. Constitutive loss-of-function of Susd4 in the mouse impairs motor coordination adaptation and learning, prevents long-term depression at cerebellar synapses, and leads to misregulation of activity-dependent AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 degradation. We identified several proteins with known roles in the regulation of AMPA receptor turnover, in particular ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily, as SUSD4 binding partners. Our findings shed light on the potential role of SUSD4 mutations in neurodevelopmental diseases.	Sushi domain-containing protein 4 controls synaptic plasticity and motor learning.	eLife
33755016	SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that normally potentiates intracellular signaling by growth factors, antigen receptors, and some cytokines, yet is frequently mutated in human cancer. Here, we examine the role of SHP2 in the responses of breast cancer cells to EGF by monitoring phosphoproteome dynamics when SHP2 is allosterically inhibited by SHP099. The dynamics of phosphotyrosine abundance at more than 400 tyrosine residues reveal six distinct response signatures following SHP099 treatment and washout. Remarkably, in addition to newly identified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCgamma2, another class of sites shows reduced phosphotyrosine abundance upon SHP2 inhibition. Sites of decreased phospho-abundance are enriched on proteins with two nearby phosphotyrosine residues, which can be directly protected from dephosphorylation by the paired SH2 domains of SHP2 itself. These findings highlight the distinct roles of the scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2 in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.	Time-resolved phosphoproteomics reveals scaffolding and catalysis-responsive patterns of SHP2-dependent signaling.	eLife
33764296	Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here, we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa, or vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.

33783355	Phytochromes are photoreceptors regulating growth and development in plants. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we identified a novel signalling pathway downstream of the far-red light-sensing phytochrome, phyA, that depends on the highly conserved CCR4-NOT complex. CCR4-NOT is integral to RNA metabolism in yeast and animals, but its function in plants is largely unknown. NOT9B, an Arabidopsis homologue of human CNOT9, is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, and acts as negative regulator of phyA-specific light signalling when bound to NOT1, the scaffold protein of the complex. Light-activated phyA interacts with and displaces NOT9B from NOT1, suggesting a potential mechanism for light signalling through CCR4-NOT. ARGONAUTE 1 and proteins involved in splicing associate with NOT9B and we show that NOT9B is required for specific phyA-dependent alternative splicing events. Furthermore, association with nuclear localised ARGONAUTE 1 raises the possibility that NOT9B and CCR4-NOT are involved in phyA-modulated gene expression.

33787491	Although the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) during embryonic development has been intensively studied in recent years, their postnatal physiological functions remain largely unexplored due to inherent difficulties with the presence of redundant paralogs of the same seed. Thus, it is particularly challenging to uncover miRNA functions at neural circuit level since animal behaviors would need to be assessed upon complete loss of miRNA family functions. Here, we focused on the neural functions of MiR34/449 that manifests a dynamic expression pattern in the spinal cord from embryonic to postnatal stages. Our behavioral assays reveal that the loss of MiR34/449 miRNAs perturb thermally induced pain response thresholds and compromised delicate motor output in mice. Mechanistically, MiR34/449 directly target Satb1 and Satb2 to fine-tune the precise number of a sub-population of motor synergy encoder (MSE) neurons. Thus, MiR34/449 fine-tunes optimal development of Satb1/2(on) interneurons in the spinal cord, thereby refining explicit sensory-to-motor circuit outputs.	MicroRNAs mediate precise control of spinal interneuron populations to exert delicate sensory-to-motor outputs.	eLife
33884955	To adapt in an ever-changing environment, cells must integrate physical and chemical signals and translate them into biological meaningful information through complex signaling pathways. By combining lipidomic and proteomic approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1 (UBTD1) plays a crucial role in both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation. On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the ubiquitination of Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) by RNF26 and endolysosome positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal. Moreover, we showed that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces cell proliferation emphasizing a hitherto unknown function of UBTD1 in EGFR-driven human cell proliferation.	UBTD1 regulates ceramide balance and endolysosomal positioning to coordinate EGFR signaling.	eLife
33890571	Disruption of the circadian clock machinery in cancer cells is implicated in tumor malignancy. Studies on cancer therapy reveal the presence of heterogeneous cells, including breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs), in breast tumors. BCSCs are often characterized by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, associated with the malignancy of cancers. In this study, we demonstrated the negative regulation of ALDH activity by the major circadian component CLOCK in murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The expression of CLOCK was repressed in high-ALDH-activity 4T1, and enhancement of CLOCK expression abrogated their stemness properties, such as tumorigenicity and invasive potential. Furthermore, reduced expression of CLOCK in high-ALDH-activity 4T1 was post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNA: miR-182. Knockout of miR-182 restored the expression of CLOCK, resulted in preventing tumor growth. Our findings suggest that increased expression of CLOCK in BCSCs by targeting post-transcriptional regulation overcame stemness-related malignancy and may be a novel strategy for breast cancer treatments.
