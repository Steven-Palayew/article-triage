Osteoporosis develops because of impaired bone formation and/or excessive bone
resorption. Several pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis has been developed;
however, new treatments are still necessary. Cholesterol and estrogen
receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRα) promote osteoclasts formation, survival,
and cellular fusion and thus become high risk factors of osteoporosis. In this
study, we identified that carnosic acid (CA) suppressed bone loss by
dual-targeting of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2, a major
regulator that regulates cholesterol synthesis) and ERRα. Mechanistically, CA
reduced nuclear localization of mature SREBP2 and suppressed de novo biogenesis
of cholesterol. CA subsequently decreased the interaction between ERRα and
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC1β),
resulting in decreased the transcription activity of ERRα and its target genes
expression. Meanwhile, CA directly bound to the ligand-binding domain of ERRα and
significantly promoted its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
Subsequently, STUB1 was identified as the E3 ligase of ERRα. The lysine residues 
(K51 and K68) are essential for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of
ERRα by CA. In conclusion, CA dually targets SREBP2 and ERRα, thus inhibits the
RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and improves OVX-induced bone loss. CA may
serve as a lead compound for pharmacological control of osteoporosis.

Intestinal epithelia self-renew constantly and generate differentiated cells such
as secretary goblet cells. The intestine goblet cells secrete gel-forming mucins 
that form mucus to create a barrier of defense. We reported previously that loss 
of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 3 led to disruption of the intestinal epithelial
barrier function. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we
demonstrate that PHD3 controls the generation of intestine goblet cell. We found 
that genetic ablation of Phd3 in mice intestine epithelial cells reduced the
amount of goblet cells. Mechanistically, PHD3 bounds the E3 ubiquitin ligase
HUWE1 and prevented HUWE1 from mediating ubiquitination and degradation of ATOH1,
an essential driver for goblet cell differentiation. The prolyl hydroxylase
activity-deficient variant PHD3(H196A) also prevented ATOH1 destruction. A
genetic intestine epithelial PHD3(H196A)-knockin had no effect on ATOH1
expression or goblet cell amount in mice, suggesting that the PHD3 prolyl
hydroxylase activity is dispensable for its ability to control ATOH1 expression
and goblet cell generation. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental 
colitis, PHD3-knockout rather than PHD3(H196A)-knockin sensitized the mice to DSS
treatment. Our results reveal an additional critical mechanism underlying the
regulation of ATOH1 expression and goblet cell generation and highlight that PHD3
plays a role in controlling intestine goblet cell generation in a
hydroxylase-independent manner.

The identification of viability-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a
means of uncovering therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In
addition, aberrant genome-wide hypomethylation has been implicated in HCC
initiation and progression. However, the relationship between lncRNA
dysregulation and genome-wide hypomethylation in hepatocarcinogenesis has not
been fully elucidated. A novel lncRNA named LINC00662 was previously demonstrated
to play a role in gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that
this lncRNA was correlated with survival and exhibited oncogenic properties, both
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we determined that LINC00662 could lead to
genome-wide hypomethylation and alter the genomic methylation profile by
synchronously reducing the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level and enhancing the
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) level. Mechanistically, LINC00662 was determined to 
regulate the key enzymes influencing SAM and SAH levels, namely, methionine
adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), by
RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that some
SAM-dependent HCC-promoting genes could be regulated by LINC00662 by altering the
methylation status of their promoters via the LINC00662-coupled axes of MAT1A/SAM
and AHCY/SAH. Taken together, the results of this this study indicate that
LINC00662 could be a potential biomarker for HCC therapy. More importantly, we
proposed a new role of lncRNA in regulating genomic methylation to promote
oncogene activation.

Progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and resistance to therapy are
affected by tumor microenvironmental factors. One such factor is B-cell
activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine that is produced mainly by nurse-like cells 
(NLC) and enhances CLL cells survival and modulates response to therapy. In CLL
cells, BAFF activates NF-κB signaling, but how NF-κB supports CLL survival is not
entirely clear. In this study we show that BAFF induces accumulation of the
signaling and autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 in a manner dependent on NF-κB
activation. p62 potentiates mTORC1 signaling and activates NRF2, the master
regulator of the anti-oxidant response. We found that expression of NRF2 target
genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), is particularly enriched 
in CLL cells with high ROR1 surface expression (ROR1Hi). ROR1Hi CLL cells with
elevated NQO1 expression exhibit resistance to drugs that induce ROS
accumulation, such venetoclax. However, such cells are more sensitive to compound
29h, a pro-drug that only becomes active after being metabolized by NQO1.
Accordingly, 29h sensitizes high NQO1 CLL cells to venetoclax. Collectively, our 
study unravels a previously unknown signaling network through which the
NF-κB-p62-NRF2 axis protects ROR1-high CLL cells from ROS-inducing therapeutics.

Heat shock can induce either cytoprotective mechanisms or cell death. We found
that in certain human and mouse cells, including spermatocytes, activated heat
shock factor 1 (HSF1) binds to sequences located in the intron(s) of the PMAIP1
(NOXA) gene and upregulates its expression which induces apoptosis. Such a mode
of PMAIP1 activation is not dependent on p53. Therefore, HSF1 not only can
activate the expression of genes encoding cytoprotective heat shock proteins,
which prevents apoptosis, but it can also positively regulate the proapoptotic
PMAIP1 gene, which facilitates cell death. This could be the primary cause of
hyperthermia-induced elimination of heat-sensitive cells, yet other pro-death
mechanisms might also be involved.

Angiogenesis plays crucial roles in maintaining the complex operation of central 
nervous system (CNS) development. The architecture of communication between
neurogenesis and angiogenesis is essential to maintain normal brain development
and function. Hence, any disruption of neuron-vascular communications may lead to
the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular diseases and blood-brain barrier (BBB)
dysfunction. Here we demonstrate that neural differentiation and communication
are required for vascular development. Regarding the cellular and molecular
mechanism, our results show that PRDM16 activity determines the production of
mature neurons and their specific positions in the neocortex. In the cortical
plate (CP), aberrant neurons fail to secrete modular calcium-binding protein 1
(SMOC1), an important neuronal signal that participates in neurovascular
communication to regulate CNS angiogenesis. Neuronal SMOC1 interacts with TGFBR1 
by activating the transcription factors phospho-Smad2/3 to convey intercellular
signals to endothelial cells (ECs) in the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. Together,
our results highlight a crucial coordinated neurovascular development process
orchestrated by PRDM16 and reveal the importance of intimate communication for
building the neurovascular network during brain development.

Rab5 is a master regulator for endosome biogenesis and transport while its in
vivo physiological function remains elusive. Here, we find that Rab5a is
upregulated in several in vivo and in vitro myogenesis models. By generating
myogenic Rab5a-deficient mice, we uncover the essential roles of Rab5a in
regulating skeletal muscle regeneration. We further reveal that Rab5a promotes
myoblast differentiation and directly interacts with insulin receptor substrate 1
(IRS1), an essential scaffold protein for propagating IGF signaling. Rab5a
interacts with IRS1 in a GTP-dependent manner and this interaction is enhanced
upon IGF-1 activation and myogenic differentiation. We subsequently identify that
the arginine 207 and 222 of IRS1 and tyrosine 82, 89, and 90 of Rab5a are the
critical amino acid residues for mediating the association. Mechanistically,
Rab5a modulates IRS1 activation by coordinating the association between IRS1 and 
the IGF receptor (IGFR) and regulating the intracellular membrane targeting of
IRS1. Both myogenesis-induced and IGF-evoked AKT-mTOR signaling are dependent on 
Rab5a. Myogenic deletion of Rab5a also reduces the activation of AKT-mTOR
signaling during skeletal muscle regeneration. Taken together, our study uncovers
the physiological function of Rab5a in regulating muscle regeneration and
delineates the novel role of Rab5a as a critical switch controlling AKT-mTOR
signaling by activating IRS1.

Mitochondria change distribution across cells following a variety of
pathophysiological stimuli. The mechanisms presiding over this redistribution are
yet undefined. In a murine model overexpressing Drp1 specifically in skeletal
muscle, we find marked mitochondria repositioning in muscle fibres and we
demonstrate that Drp1 is involved in this process. Drp1 binds KLC1 and enhances
microtubule-dependent transport of mitochondria. Drp1-KLC1 coupling triggers the 
displacement of KIF5B from kinesin-1 complex increasing its binding to
microtubule tracks and mitochondrial transport. High levels of Drp1 exacerbate
this mechanism leading to the repositioning of mitochondria closer to nuclei. The
reduction of Drp1 levels decreases kinesin-1 activation and induces the partial
recovery of mitochondrial distribution. Drp1 overexpression is also associated
with higher cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk-1) activation that promotes the
persistent phosphorylation of desmin at Ser-31 and its disassembling. Fission
inhibition has a positive effect on desmin Ser-31 phosphorylation, regardless of 
Cdk-1 activation, suggesting that induction of both fission and Cdk-1 are
required for desmin collapse. This altered desmin architecture impairs
mechanotransduction and compromises mitochondrial network stability priming
mitochondria transport through microtubule-dependent trafficking with a mechanism
that involves the Drp1-dependent regulation of kinesin-1 complex.

Erratum in
    Cell Death Differ. 2020 Apr 6;:.

Cancer cells are defective in DNA repair, so they experience increased DNA strand
breaks, genome instability, gene mutagenesis, and tumorigenicity; however,
multiple classic DNA repair genes and pathways are strongly activated in
malignant tumor cells to compensate for the DNA repair deficiency and gain an
apoptosis resistance. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in cancer are
unclear. We speculate that a key DNA repair gene or signaling pathway in cancer
has not yet been recognized. Here, we show that the lipogenic liver X receptor
(LXR)-sterol response element binding factor-1 (SREBF1) axis controls the
transcription of a key DNA repair gene polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), 
thereby governing cancer cell DNA repair and apoptosis. Notably, the PNKP levels 
were significantly reduced in 95% of human pancreatic cancer (PC) patients,
particularly deep reduction for sixfold in all of the advanced-stage PC cases.
PNKP is also deficient in three other types of cancer that we examined. In
addition, the expression of LXRs and SREBF1 was significantly reduced in the
tumor tissues from human PC patients compared with the adjacent normal tissues.
The newly identified LXR-SREBF1-PNKP signaling pathway is deficient in PC, and
the defect in the pathway contributes to the DNA repair deficiency in the cancer.
Strikingly, further diminution of the vulnerable LXR-SREBF1-PNKP signaling
pathway using a small molecule triptonide, a new LXR antagonist identified in
this investigation, at a concentration of 8 nM robustly activated
tumor-suppressor p53 and readily elevated cancer cell DNA strand breaks over an
apoptotic threshold, and selectively induced PC cell apoptosis, resulting in
almost complete elimination of tumors in xenograft mice without obvious
complications. Our findings provide new insight into DNA repair and apoptosis in 
cancer, and offer a new platform for developing novel anticancer therapeutics.

MCL1, a BCL2 relative, is critical for the survival of many cells. Its turnover
is often tightly controlled through both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent
mechanisms of proteasomal degradation. Several cell stress signals, including DNA
damage and cell cycle arrest, are known to elicit distinct E3 ligases to
ubiquitinate and degrade MCL1. Another trigger that drives MCL1 degradation is
engagement by NOXA, one of its BH3-only protein ligands, but the mechanism
responsible has remained unclear. From an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9
screen, we discovered that the ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH5, the ubiquitin E2
conjugating enzyme UBE2K, and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2
co-operate to mark MCL1 for degradation by the proteasome-specifically when MCL1 
is engaged by NOXA. This mechanism of degradation also required the MCL1
transmembrane domain and distinct MCL1 lysine residues to proceed, suggesting
that the components likely act on the MCL1:NOXA complex by associating with it in
a specific orientation within the mitochondrial outer membrane. MTCH2 has not
previously been reported to regulate protein stability, but is known to influence
the mitochondrial localization of certain key apoptosis regulators and to impact 
metabolism. We have now pinpointed an essential but previously unappreciated role
for MTCH2 in turnover of the MCL1:NOXA complex by MARCH5, further strengthening
its links to BCL2-regulated apoptosis.

Angiotensin-(1-9) is a peptide from the noncanonical renin-angiotensin system
with anti-hypertrophic effects in cardiomyocytes via an unknown mechanism. In the
present study we aimed to elucidate it, basing us initially on previous work from
our group and colleagues who proved a relationship between disturbances in
mitochondrial morphology and calcium handling, associated with the setting of
cardiac hypertrophy. Our first finding was that angiotensin-(1-9) can induce
mitochondrial fusion through DRP1 phosphorylation. Secondly, angiotensin-(1-9)
blocked mitochondrial fission and intracellular calcium dysregulation in a model 
of norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, preventing the activation of
the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. To further investigate angiotensin-(1-9) 
anti-hypertrophic mechanism, we performed RNA-seq studies, identifying the
upregulation of miR-129 under angiotensin-(1-9) treatment. miR-129 decreased the 
transcript levels of the protein kinase A inhibitor (PKIA), resulting in the
activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Finally, we showed
that PKA activity is necessary for the effects of angiotensin-(1-9) over
mitochondrial dynamics, calcium handling and its anti-hypertrophic effects.

The elevated expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) and increased
PARP1 activity, namely, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), have been observed
in cardiac remodeling, leading to extreme energy consumption and myocardial
damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PARP1 require
further study. WWP2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is highly expressed in the 
heart, but its function there is largely unknown. Here, we clarified the role of 
WWP2 in the regulation of PARP1 and the impact of this regulatory process on
cardiac remodeling. We determined that the knockout of WWP2 specifically in
myocardium decreased the level of PARP1 ubiquitination and increased the effects 
of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced PARP1 and PARylation, in turn aggravating
ISO-induced myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, and myocardial fibrosis.
Similar findings were obtained in a model of ISO-induced H9c2 cells with WWP2
knockdown, while the reexpression of WWP2 significantly increased PARP1
ubiquitination and decreased PAPR1 and PARylation levels. Mechanistically,
coimmunoprecipitation results identified that WWP2 is a novel interacting protein
of PARP1 and mainly interacts with its BRCT domain, thus mediating the
degradation of PARP1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In addition, lysine
418 (K418) and lysine 249 (K249) were shown to be of critical importance in
regulating PARP1 ubiquitination and degradation by WWP2. These findings reveal a 
novel WWP2-PARP1 signal transduction pathway involved in controlling cardiac
remodeling and may provide a basis for exploring new strategies for treating
heart disorders related to cardiac remodeling.

Liver dysfunction is strongly associated with poor survival of sepsis patients.
Cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing by Caspase-4/5/11 for pyroptosis
activation is a major driver of the development of sepsis. Studies in macrophages
and endothelial cells have demonstrated that LPS is inactivated by acyloxyacyl
hydrolase (AOAH) and leading to desensitizing Caspase-4/5/11 to LPS. However,
little is known about the cytosolic LPS-induced pyroptosis in hepatocytes during 
sepsis. Heat shock protein 12A (HSPA12A) is a novel member of the HSP70 family.
Here, we report that LPS increased HSPA12A nuclear translocation in hepatocytes, 
while knockout of HSPA12A (Hspa12a-/-) in mice promoted LPS-induced acute liver
injury. We also noticed that the LPS-induced Caspase-11 activation and its
cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) to produce the membrane pore-forming GSDMDNterm
(markers of pyroptosis) were greater in livers of Hspa12a-/- mice compared with
its wild type controls. Loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that HSPA12A
deficiency promoted, whereas HSPA12A overexpression inhibited, cytosolic LPS
accumulation, Caspase-11 activation and GSDMDNterm generation in primary
hepatocytes following LPS incubation. Notably, LPS-induced AOAH expression was
suppressed by HSPA12A deficiency, whereas AOAH overexpression reversed the
HSPA12A deficiency-induced promotion of LPS-evoked and Caspase-11-mediated
pyroptosis of hepatocytes. In-depth molecular analysis showed that HSPA12A
interacted directly with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator
1α (PGC-1α) and increased its nuclear translocation, thereby inducing AOAH
expression for cytosolic LPS inactivation, which ultimately leading to inhibition
of the Caspase-11 mediated pyroptosis of hepatocytes. Taken together, these
findings revealed HSPA12A as a novel player against LPS-induced liver injury by
inhibiting cytosolic LPS-induced hepatocyte pyroptosis via PGC-1α-mediated AOAH
expression. Therefore, targeting hepatocyte HSPA12A represents a viable strategy 
for the management of liver injury in sepsis patients.

TRAIL-R2 (DR5) is a clinically-relevant therapeutic target and a key target for
immune effector cells. Herein, we identify a novel interaction between TRAIL-R2
and the Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box (SCF) Cullin-Ring E3 Ubiquitin Ligase complex
containing Skp2 (SCFSkp2). We find that SCFSkp2 can interact with both TRAIL-R2's
pre-ligand association complex (PLAC) and ligand-activated death-inducing
signalling complex (DISC). Moreover, Cullin-1 interacts with TRAIL-R2 in its
active NEDDylated form. Inhibiting Cullin-1's DISC recruitment using the
NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) or siRNA increased apoptosis
induction in response to TRAIL. This correlated with enhanced levels of the
caspase-8 regulator FLIP at the TRAIL-R2 DISC, particularly the long splice form,
FLIP(L). We subsequently found that FLIP(L) (but not FLIP(S), caspase-8, nor the 
other core DISC component FADD) interacts with Cullin-1 and Skp2. Importantly,
this interaction is enhanced when FLIP(L) is in its DISC-associated, C-terminally
truncated p43-form. Prevention of FLIP(L) processing to its p43-form stabilises
the protein, suggesting that by enhancing its interaction with SCFSkp2, cleavage 
to the p43-form is a critical step in FLIP(L) turnover. In support of this, we
found that silencing any of the components of the SCFSkp2 complex inhibits FLIP
ubiquitination, while overexpressing Cullin-1/Skp2 enhances its ubiquitination in
a NEDDylation-dependent manner. DISC recruitment of TRAF2, previously identified 
as an E3 ligase for caspase-8 at the DISC, was also enhanced when Cullin-1's
recruitment was inhibited, although its interaction with Cullin-1 was found to be
mediated indirectly via FLIP(L). Notably, the interaction of p43-FLIP(L) with
Cullin-1 disrupts its ability to interact with FADD, caspase-8 and TRAF2.
Collectively, our results suggest that processing of FLIP(L) to p43-FLIP(L) at
the TRAIL-R2 DISC enhances its interaction with co-localised SCFSkp2, leading to 
disruption of p43-FLIP(L)'s interactions with other DISC components and promoting
its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating TRAIL-R2-mediated
apoptosis.

ErbB2 overexpression identifies a subclass of breast cancer as ErbB2-positive
that is frequently associated with poor prognosis. Current ErbB2-targeted
therapies have profoundly improved patient outcomes, but mutations occurring in
ErbB2 have been shown to confer drug resistance. Induction of ErbB2 degradation
was proposed as an intriguing strategy to battle with ErbB2-positive breast
cancer and reduced mutation-incurred drug resistance. Although multiple HSP90
inhibitors have been demonstrated to effectively trigger ErbB2 degradation, none 
succeeded in the clinical evaluations. To develop novel ErbB2-targeting
strategies, we investigated the endocytic degradation and reversible
ubiquitylation of ErbB2 in breast cancer. In this study, we reveal that HSP90
inhibition leads to efficient ubiquitylation and endocytic degradation of ErbB2
through the canonical endo-lysosomal route. USP2 associates with internalized
ErbB2 and prevents its lysosomal sorting and degradation via exerting
deubiquitylase activity. Accordingly, the USP2 inhibitor ML364 is capable of
inducing ErbB2 ubiquitylation and accelerating its turnover. ML364 potentiates
the pro-degradation effects of HSP90 inhibitors on ErbB2 and hence sensitizes
ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition. The combination of USP2
and HSP90 inhibitors effectively restrains ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenograft
growth in vivo. Based on these observations, we conclude that USP2 safeguards
ErbB2 surface levels by antagonizing its ubiquitylation-mediated endocytic
degradation, which can be exploited to design novel therapeutic strategies
against ErbB2-driven malignancies as combinatorial treatment with HSP90
inhibitors.

Erratum in
    Cell Death Differ. 2020 Jul 20;:.

The Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) is a stimulation-dependent form of
apoptosis used by the organism to shutdown T-cell response once the source of
inflammation has been eliminated, while allowing the generation of immune memory.
AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL
pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid 
activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria
undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C
release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not
depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify
the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the 
MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the
pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates
cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer
Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly,
we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
(T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.

Although the roles of the Hippo pathway in organogenesis and tumorigenesis have
been well studied in multiple organs, its role in sperm maturation and male
fertility has not been investigated. The initial segment (IS) of the epididymis
plays a critical role in sperm maturation. IS differentiation is governed by
ERK1/2, but the mechanisms of ERK1/2 activation in IS are not fully understood.
Here we show that double knockout (dKO) of mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1
and 2 (Mst1 and Mst2), homologs of Hippo in Drosophila, in the epididymal
epithelium led to male infertility in mice. Sperm in the cauda epididymides of
mutant mice were immotile with flagellar angulation and severely disorganized
structures. Loss of Mst1/2 activated YAP and increased proliferation and cell
death in all the segments of epididymis. The mutant mice showed substantially
suppressed MEK/ERK signaling in the IS and failed IS differentiation. Deletion of
Yap restored the reduced MEK/ERK signaling, and partially rescued the defective
IS differentiation and fertility in Mst1/2 dKO mice. Our results demonstrate that
YAP inhibits the MEK/ERK pathway in IS epithelial cells, and MST1/2 control IS
differentiation and fertility at least partially by repressing YAP. Taken
together, the Hippo pathway is essential for sperm maturation and male fertility.

Pathological cardiac hypertrophy eventually leads to heart failure without
adequate treatment. REGγ is emerging as 11S proteasome activator of 20S
proteasome to promote the degradation of cellular proteins in a ubiquitin- and
ATP-independent manner. Here, we found that REGγ was significantly upregulated in
the transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced hypertrophic hearts and
angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated cardiomyocytes. REGγ deficiency ameliorated
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy were associated with inhibition of 
cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and suppression of protein
phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit α (PP2Acα) decay. Mechanistically, REGγ
interacted with and targeted PP2Acα for degradation directly, thereby leading to 
increase of phosphorylation levels and nuclear export of Forkhead box protein O
(FoxO) 3a and subsequent of SOD2 decline, ROS accumulation, and cardiac
hypertrophy. Introducing exogenous PP2Acα or SOD2 to human cardiomyocytes
significantly rescued the REGγ-mediated ROS accumulation of Ang II stimulation in
vitro. Furthermore, treatment with superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP prevented
cardiac ROS production and hypertrophy features that REGγ caused in vivo, thereby
establishing a REGγ-PP2Acα-FoxO3a-SOD2 pathway in cardiac oxidative stress and
hypertrophy, indicates modulating the REGγ-proteasome activity may be a potential
therapeutic approach in cardiac hypertrophy-associated disorders.

The mesenchymal transcription factor forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) is a critical
regulator of embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Our previous studies
demonstrated that FOXF2 is ectopically expressed in basal-like breast cancer
(BLBC) cells and that FOXF2 deficiency promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and aggressiveness of BLBC cells. In this study, we found that FOXF2
controls transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathway
activation through transrepression of TGF-β-coding genes in BLBC cells.
FOXF2-deficient BLBC cells adopt a myofibroblast-/cancer-associated fibroblast
(CAF)-like phenotype, and tend to metastasize to visceral organs by increasing
autocrine TGF-β signaling and conferring aggressiveness to neighboring cells by
increasing paracrine TGF-β signaling. In turn, TGF-β silences FOXF2 expression
through upregulating miR-182-5p, a posttranscriptional regulator of FOXF2 and
inducer of metastasis. In addition to mediating a reciprocal repression loop
between FOXF2 and TGF-β through direct transrepression by SMAD3, miR-182-5p forms
a reciprocal repression loop with FOXF2 that directly transrepresses MIR182
expression. Therefore, FOXF2 deficiency accelerates the visceral metastasis of
BLBC through unrestricted increases in autocrine and paracrine TGF-β signaling,
and miR-182-5p expression. Our findings provide novel mechanisms underlying the
roles of TGF-β, miR-182-5p, and FOXF2 in accelerating BLBC dissemination and
metastasis, and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for
aggressive BLBC.

Conventional screening methods for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have important
limitations. A loss-of-function study based on the knockout of DUB genes in
mammalian cells can provide an excellent model for exploring DUB function. Here, 
we used CRISPR-Cas9 to perform genome-scale knockout of the entire set of genes
encoding ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), a DUB subfamily, and then
systematically screened for DUBs that stabilize the Cdc25A oncoprotein. USP3 was 
identified as a deubiquitinase of Cdc25A. USP3 depletion reduces the Cdc25A
protein level, resulting in a significant delay in cell-cycle progression, and
reduces the growth of cervical tumor xenografts in nude mice. Clinically, USP3
expression is positively correlated with Cdc25A protein expression and the
poorest survival in breast cancer. We envision that our DUB knockout library kit 
will facilitate genome-scale screening of functional DUBs for target proteins of 
interest in a wide range of biomedical fields.

The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family is closely related to the progression of glioma.
To ensure the clinical significance of LOX family in glioma, The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) database was mined and the analysis indicated that higher LOXL1
expression was correlated with more malignant glioma progression. The functions
of LOXL1 in promoting glioma cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis were studied 
by gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cells and animals. LOXL1 was found
to exhibit antiapoptotic activity by interacting with multiple antiapoptosis
modulators, especially BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 2 (BAG2).
LOXL1-D515 interacted with BAG2-K186 through a hydrogen bond, and its lysyl
oxidase activity prevented BAG2 degradation by competing with K186
ubiquitylation. Then, we discovered that LOXL1 expression was specifically
upregulated through the VEGFR-Src-CEBPA axis. Clinically, the patients with
higher LOXL1 levels in their blood had much more abundant BAG2 protein levels in 
glioma tissues. Conclusively, LOXL1 functions as an important mediator that
increases the antiapoptotic capacity of tumor cells, and approaches targeting
LOXL1 represent a potential strategy for treating glioma. In addition, blood
LOXL1 levels can be used as a biomarker to monitor glioma progression.

CD4/CD8 T-cell lineage differentiation is a key process in immune system
development; however, a defined regulator(s) that converts the signal from T-cell
receptor and co-receptor complexes into lineage differentiation remains unclear. 
Here, we show that Twist2 is a critical factor in CD4/CD8 thymocyte
differentiation. Twist2 expression is differentially regulated by T-cell receptor
signaling, leading to differentiation into the CD4 or CD8 lineage. Forced Twist2 
expression perturbed CD4+ thymocyte differentiation while enhancing CD8+
thymocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Twist2 expression produced mature CD8+
thymocytes in B2m-/- mice, while its deficiency significantly impaired CD8+ cells
in MHC class-II-/- and TCR transgenic mice, favoring CD8 T-cell differentiation. 
During CD8 lineage differentiation, Twist2 interacted with Runx3 to bind to the
silencer region of the ThPOK locus, thereby blocking ThPOK expression. These
findings indicate that Twist2 is a part of the transcription factor network
controlling CD8 lineage differentiation.

Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death caused by formation of the
necrosome complex. However, the factors modulating this process and the systemic 
pathophysiological effects of necroptosis are yet to be understood. Here, we
identified that Beclin 1 functions as an anti-necroptosis factor by being
recruited into the necrosome complex upon treatment with TNFα, Smac mimetic, and 
pan-caspase inhibitor and by repressing MLKL oligomerisation, thus preventing the
disruption of the plasma membrane. Cells ablated or knocked-out for Beclin 1
become sensitised to necroptosis in an autophagy-independent manner without
affecting the necrosome formation itself. Interestingly, the recruitment of
Beclin 1 into the necrosome complex is dependent on the activation and
phosphorylation of MLKL. Biochemically, the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of Beclin 1 
binds to the CCD of MLKL, which restrains the oligomerisation of phosphorylated
MLKL. Finally, Beclin 1 depletion was found to promote necroptosis in leukaemia
cells and enhance regression of xenografted-tumour upon treatment with Smac
mimetics and caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that Beclin 1 functions as
a negative regulator in the execution of necroptosis by suppressing MLKL
oligomerisation.

Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays multiple roles in many physiological processes and
its dysregulation leads to congenital disorders and cancers. Hh regulates the
cellular localization of Smoothened (Smo) and the stability of Cubitus
interruptus (Ci) to fine-tune the signal outputs. However, the underlying
mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that the scaffold protein Rack1 plays
dual roles in Hh signaling. In the absence of Hh, Rack1 promotes Ci and Cos2 to
form a Ci-Rack1-Cos2 complex, culminating in Slimb-mediated Ci proteolysis. In
the presence of Hh, Rack1 dissociates from Ci-Rack1-Cos2 complex and forms a
trimeric complex with Smo and Usp8, leading to Smo deubiquitination and cell
surface accumulation. Furthermore, we find the regulation of Rack1 on Hh pathway 
is conserved from Drosophila to mammalian cells. Our findings demonstrate that
Rack1 plays dual roles during Hh signal transduction and provide Rack1 as a
potential drug target for Hh-related diseases.

Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is the crucial factor in ERα-positive breast cancer
progression. Endocrine therapies targeting ERα signaling is one of the widely
used therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. However, a large number of the
patients become refractory to therapy. Abnormal expression of ERα co-regulator
facilitates breast cancer development and tendency of endocrine resistance. Thus,
it is necessary to discover the novel co-regulators modulating ERα action. Here, 
we demonstrate that histone deubiquitinase USP22 is highly expressed in breast
cancer samples compared with that in the benign tissue, and high expression of
USP22 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival in BCa samples.
Moreover, USP22 associates with ERα to be involved in maintenance of ERα
stability. USP22 enhances ERα-induced transactivation. We further provide the
evidence that USP22 is recruited together with ERα to cis-regulatory elements of 
ERα target gene. USP22 promotes cell growth even under hypoxia condition and with
the treatment of ERα antagonist in breast cancer cells. Importantly, the
deubiquitination activity of USP22 is required for its functions on maintenance
of ERα stability, thereby enhancing ERα action and conferring endocrine
resistance in breast cancer.

Ovarian tumour domain-containing protein 3 (OTUD3), a key OTU (ovarian tumour
protease) family deubiquitylase, plays context-dependent roles in cancers. It
suppresses tumorigenesis in breast, colon, liver and cervical cancer through
stabilizing PTEN (phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10)
while promotes lung tumorigenesis through stabilizing GRP78 (The
glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa). The regulation especially post-translational
modification of OTUD3 remains unclear. Here, we report that the carboxyl terminus
of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a ubiquitin ligase for OTUD3. CHIP
interacts with, polyubiquitylates OTUD3 and promotes OTUD3 degradation. Knockdown
of CHIP stabilizes OTUD3 which leads to elevated GRP78 levels in lung cancer
cells. CHIP-knockdown lung cancer cells exhibit increased invasion in OTUD3 and
GRP78 dependent manner. Further study demonstrates that CHIP-knockdown lung
cancer cells are more prone to metastasize to mice lung when injected
intravenously or subcutaneously. Moreover, the expression of CHIP is low in human
lung cancer tissues and inversely correlates with OTUD3 expression and GRP78
expression. Furthermore, we identified CHIP mutations in human lung cancers,
which reduce CHIP catalytic activity. These findings demonstrate that CHIP is a
negative regulator of OTUD3 and CHIP suppresses lung cancer metastasis through
inhibiting OTUD3-GRP78 signaling axis.

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a key histone methyltransferase and EMT
inducer, is overexpressed in diverse carcinomas, including breast cancer.
However, the molecular mechanisms of EZH2 dysregulation in cancers are still
largely unknown. Here, we discover that EZH2 is asymmetrically dimethylated at
R342 (meR342-EZH2) by PRMT1. meR342-EZH2 was found to inhibit the CDK1-mediated
phosphorylation of EZH2 at T345 and T487, thereby attenuating EZH2 ubiquitylation
mediated by the E3 ligase TRAF6. We also demonstrate that meR342-EZH2 resulted in
a decrease in EZH2 target gene expression, but an increase in breast cancer cell 
EMT, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, we confirm the positive correlations
among PRMT1, meR342-EZH2 and EZH2 expression in the breast cancer tissues.
Finally, we report that high expression levels of meR342-EZH2 predict a poor
clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Our findings may provide a novel
diagnostic target and promising therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis.

Early studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) might play important
roles in the regulating of the initiation and progression of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), but its linkage to the surrounding macrophages and their impacts
on the HCC progression remain unclear. Here we found that macrophages in liver
cancer might function via altering the microRNA, miR-92a-2-5p, in exosomes to
decrease liver cancer cells AR expression, which might then lead to increase the 
liver cancer cells invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that miR-92a-2-5p from
the exosomes could target the 3'UTR of AR mRNA to suppress AR translation,
altering the PHLPP/p-AKT/β-catenin signaling to increase liver cancer cells
invasion. Preclinical studies demonstrated that targeting this newly identified
signaling with miR-92a-2-5p inhibitors led to suppress liver cancer progression. 
Together, these findings suggest that macrophages in the liver cancer tumor
microenvironment may function via exosomes to regulate liver cancer progression, 
and targeting this newly identified
macrophages/exosomes-miR-92a-2-5p/AR/PHLPP/p-AKT/β-catenin signaling may help in 
the development of novel treatment strategies to better suppress liver cancer
progression.

The development of skeletal muscle requires progression of a highly ordered
cascade of events comprising myogenic lineage commitment, myoblast proliferation,
and terminal differentiation. The process of myogenesis is controlled by several 
myogenic transcription factors that act as terminal effectors of signaling
cascades and produce appropriate developmental stage-specific transcripts. PHD
finger protein 20 (PHF20) is a multidomain protein and subunit of a lysine
acetyltransferase complex that acetylates histone H4 and p53, but its function is
unclear. Notably, it has been reported that PHF20 knockout mice die shortly after
birth and display a wide variety of phenotypes within the skeletal and
hematopoietic systems. Therefore, the putative role of PHF20 in myogenic
differentiation was further investigated. In the present study, we found that
protein and mRNA expression levels of PHF20 were decreased during myogenic
differentiation in C2C12 cells. At the same time, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) was also
decreased during myogenic differentiation. PHF20 overexpression increased YY1
expression during myogenic differentiation, together with a delay in MyoD
expression. PHF20 expression enhanced the transcriptional activity of YY1 while
shRNA-mediated depletion of PHF20 resulted in the reduction of YY1 promoter
activity in C2C12 cells. In addition, PHF20 directly bounds to the YY1 promoter
in C2C12 cells. In a similar manner, YY1 expression was elevated while myosin
heavy chain expression was decreased in PHF20 transgenic (TG) mice. Histological 
analysis revealed abnormalities in the shape and length of muscles in PHF20-TG
mice. Furthermore, PHF20-TG muscles slowly regenerated after cardiotoxin
injection, indicating that PHF20 affected muscle differentiation and regeneration
after injury in vivo. Taken together, these results suggested that PHF20 plays an
important role in myogenic differentiation by regulating YY1.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignant tumor of female reproductive system. 
It is well-known that induction of STING-mediated type I interferons can enhance 
the resultant antitumor activity. However, STING pathway is usually inactivated
in cancer cells at multiple levels. Here, we identified deubiquitinase USP35 is
upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues. High level of USP35 was correlated with
diminished CD8+ T cell infiltration and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer
patients. Mechanistically, we found that silencing USP35 reinforces the
activation of STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway and promotes the expression of type I
interferons. Our data further showed that USP35 can directly deubiquitinate and
inactivate STING. Interestingly, activation of STING promotes its binding to
USP35 in a STING phosphorylation-dependent manner. Functionally, we found that
knockdown of USP35 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to the DNA-damage
chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Overall, our study indicates that upregulation
of USP35 may be a mechanism of the restricted STING activity in cancer cells, and
highlights the significance of USP35 as a potential therapeutic target for
ovarian cancer.

ABSTRICT: LINC00941 is a novel lncRNA that has been found to exhibit
protumorigenic and prometastatic behaviors during tumorigenesis. However, its
role in metastatic CRC remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the functions and
mechanisms of LINC00941 in CRC metastasis. LINC00941 was shown to be upregulated 
in CRC, and upregulated LINC00941 was associated with poor prognosis.
Functionally, LINC00941 promoted migratory and invasive capacities and
accelerated lung metastasis in nude mice. Mechanistically, LINC00941 activated
EMT in CRC cells, as indicated by the increased expression of key molecular
markers of cell invasion and metastasis (Vimentin, Fibronectin, and Twist1) and
simultaneous decreased expression of the main invasion suppressors E-cadherin and
ZO-1. LINC00941 was found to activate EMT by directly binding the SMAD4 protein
MH2 domain and competing with β-TrCP to prevent SMAD4 protein degradation, thus
activating the TGF-β/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. Our data reveal the essential
role of LINC00941 in metastatic CRC via activation of the TGF-β/SMAD2/3 axis,
which provides new insight into the mechanism of metastatic CRC and a novel
potential therapeutic target for advanced CRC.

SUMO E3 ligases specify protein substrates for SUMOylation. The SUMO E3 ligases
PIAS1 and TIF1γ target the transcriptional regulator SnoN for SUMOylation leading
to suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Whether and how TIF1γ 
and PIAS1 might coordinate SnoN SUMOylation and regulation of EMT remained
unknown. Here, we reveal that SnoN associates simultaneously with both TIF1γ and 
PIAS1, leading to a trimeric protein complex. Hence, PIAS1 and TIF1γ collaborate 
to promote the SUMOylation of SnoN. Importantly, loss of function studies of
PIAS1 and TIF1γ suggest that these E3 ligases act in an interdependent manner to 
suppress EMT of breast cell-derived tissue organoids. Collectively, our findings 
unveil a novel mechanism by which SUMO E3 ligases coordinate substrate
SUMOylation with biological implications.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) activation via
autophosphorylation is the central cellular response to stress that promotes cell
death or apoptosis. However, the key factors and mechanisms behind the
simultaneous activation of pro-survival signaling pathways remain unknown. We
have discovered a novel regulatory mechanism for the maintenance of cellular
homeostasis that relies on the phosphorylation interplay between sphingosine
kinase 1 (SPHK1) and PKR during exogenous stress. We identified SPHK1 as a
previously unrecognized PKR substrate. Phosphorylated SPHK1, a central kinase,
mediates the activation of PKR-induced pro-survival pathways by the
S1P/S1PR1/MAPKs/IKKα signal axis, and antagonizes PKR-mediated endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress signal transduction under stress conditions. Otherwise,
phosphorylated SPHK1 also acts as the negative feedback factor, preferentially
binding to the latent form of PKR at the C-terminal kinase motif, inhibiting the 
homodimerization of PKR, suppressing PKR autophosphorylation, and reducing the
signaling strength for cell death and apoptosis. Our results suggest that the
balance of the activation levels between PKR and SPHK1, a probable hallmark of
homeostasis maintenance, determines cell fate during cellular stress response.

Anthracyclines are a class of conventional and commonly used frontline
chemotherapy drugs to treat breast cancer. However, the anthracycline-based
regimens can only reduce breast cancer mortality by 20-30%. Furthermore, there is
no appropriate biomarker for predicting responses to this kind of chemotherapy
currently. Here we report our findings that may fill this gap by showing the AQP1
(Aquaporin1) protein as a potential response predictor in the anthracycline
chemotherapy. We showed that breast cancer patients with a high level of AQP1
expression who underwent the anthracycline treatment had a better clinical
outcome relative to those with a low level of AQP1 expression. In the exploration
of the underlying mechanisms, we found that the AQP1 and glycogen synthase
kinase-3β (GSK3β) competitively interacted with the 12 armadillo repeats of
β-catenin, followed by the inhibition of the β-catenin degradation that led to
β-catenin's accumulation in the cytoplasm and nuclear translocation. The nuclear 
β-catenin interacted with TopoIIα and enhanced TopoIIα's activity, which resulted
in a high sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anthracyclines. We also found,
the miR-320a-3p can attenuate the anthracycline's chemosensitivity by inhibiting 
the AQP1 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest the efficacy of AQP1 as
a response predictor in the anthracycline chemotherapy. The application of our
study includes, but is not limited to, facilitating screening of the most
appropriate breast cancer patients (who have a high AQP1 expression) for better
anthracycline chemotherapy and improved prognosis purposes.

NF-κB signaling plays a critical role in tumor growth and treatment resistance in
GBM as in many other cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying high, 
constitutive NF-κB activity in GBM remains to be elucidated. Here, we screened a 
panel of tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins and identified TRIM22 as a
potential activator of NF-κB using an NF-κB driven luciferase reporter construct 
in GBM cell lines. Knockout of TRIM22 using Cas9-sgRNAs led to reduced GBM cell
proliferation, while TRIM22 overexpression enhanced proliferation of cell
populations, in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model. However, two TRIM22
mutants, one with a critical RING-finger domain deletion and the other with amino
acid changes at two active sites of RING E3 ligase (C15/18A), were both unable to
promote GBM cell proliferation over controls, thus implicating E3 ligase activity
in the growth-promoting properties of TRIM22. Co-immunoprecipitations
demonstrated that TRIM22 bound a negative regulator of NF-κB, NF-κB inhibitor
alpha (IκBα), and accelerated its degradation by inducing K48-linked
ubiquitination. TRIM22 also formed a complex with the NF-κB upstream regulator
IKKγ and promoted K63-linked ubiquitination, which led to the phosphorylation of 
both IKKα/β and IκBα. Expression of a non-phosphorylation mutant, srIκBα,
inhibited the growth-promoting properties of TRIM22 in GBM cell lines. Finally,
TRIM22 was increased in a cohort of primary GBM samples on a tissue microarray,
and high expression of TRIM22 correlated with other clinical parameters
associated with progressive gliomas, such as wild-type IDH1 status. In summary,
our study revealed that TRIM22 activated NF-κB signaling through
posttranslational modification of two critical regulators of NF-κB signaling in
GBM cells.

Mitotic catastrophe (MC) is an important oncosuppressive mechanism that serves to
eliminate cells that become polyploid or aneuploid due to aberrant mitosis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation and catalytic function of 
caspase-2 are key steps in MC to trigger apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest of
mitotically defective cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate
caspase-2 activation and its function are unclear. Here, we identify six new
phosphorylation sites in caspase-2 and show that a key mitotic kinase, Aurora
B kinase (AURKB), phosphorylates caspase-2 at the highly conserved residue S384. 
We demonstrate that phosphorylation at S384 blocks caspase-2 catalytic activity
and apoptosis function in response to mitotic insults, without affecting
caspase-2 dimerisation. Moreover, molecular modelling suggests that
phosphorylation at S384 may affect substrate binding by caspase-2. We propose
that caspase-2 S384 phosphorylation by AURKB is a key mechanism that controls
caspase-2 activation during mitosis.

STAT1 is a master regulator that orchestrates type 1 and 2 interferon
(IFN)-induced IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. The mechanisms by which STAT1
is phosphorylated and activated upon IFN signaling remain elusive. Our work
demonstrated that ubiquitination of STAT1 mediated by the E3 ligase RNF220
contributed significantly to STAT1 activation and innate immune responses. Rnf220
gene deficiency resulted in the downregulation of IFN signaling and decreased
expression of ISGs in response to type 1 and 2 IFNs stimulation and Acinetobacter
baumannii and HSV-1 infection. Mechanistically, RNF220 interacted with STAT1 and 
mediated the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1 at residue K110, which
promoted the interaction between STAT1 and the kinase JAK1. The expression of
RNF220 was induced by pathogenic infection and IFN signaling. RNF220 promoted
STAT1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation through a positive feedback loop. RNF220
haploinsufficiency impaired IFN signaling, and RNF220-defective mice were more
susceptible to A. baumannii and HSV-1 infection than WT mice. Our work offers
novel insights into the mechanisms of STAT1 modulation and provides potential
therapeutic targets against bacterial and viral infection and inflammatory
diseases.

UBE2O, an E2/E3 hybrid ubiquitin-protein ligase, has been implicated in the
regulation of adipogenesis, erythroid differentiation, and tumor proliferation.
However, its role in cancer radioresistance remains completely unknown. Here, we 
uncover that UBE2O interacts and targets Mxi1 for ubiquitination and degradation 
at the K46 residue. Furthermore, we show that genetical or pharmacological
blockade of UBE2O impairs tumor progression and radioresistance in lung cancer in
vitro and in vivo, and these effects can be restored by Mxi1 inhibition.
Moreover, we demonstrate that UBE2O is overexpressed and negatively correlated
with Mxi1 protein levels in lung cancer tissues. Collectively, our work reveals
that UBE2O facilitates tumorigenesis and radioresistance by promoting Mxi1
ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that UBE2O is an attractive
radiosensitization target for the treatment of lung cancer.

Clinical response to immunotherapy is closely associated with the
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), and influenced by the dynamic
interaction between tumour cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Here, we
show that high levels of miR-142-5p positively correlate with indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in tumour-associated lymphatic vessels in
advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The miR-142-5p is transferred
by CSCC-secreted exosomes into LECs to exhaust CD8+ T cells via the up-regulation
of lymphatic IDO expression, which was abrogated by an IDO inhibitor.
Mechanistically, miR-142-5p directly down-regulates lymphatic AT-rich interactive
domain-containing protein 2 (ARID2) expression, inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 
(DNMT1) recruitment to interferon (IFN)-γ promoter, and enhances IFN-γ
transcription by suppressing promoter methylation, thereby leading to elevated
IDO activity. Furthermore, increased serum exosomal miR-142-5p levels and the
consequent IDO activity positively correlate with CSCC progression. In
conclusion, exosomes secreted by CSCC cells deliver miR-142-5p to LECs and induce
IDO expression via ARID2-DNMT1-IFN-γ signalling to suppress and exhaust CD8+ T
cells. Our study suggests that LECs act as an integral component of the immune
checkpoint(s) in the TME and may serve as a potential new target for CSCC
diagnosis and treatment.

Dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death is a
central feature of malignances. Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3)
regulates programmed cell death including apoptosis and autophagy. Our previous
study showed that DAPK3 downregulation was detected in more than half of gastric 
cancers (GCs), which was related to tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor
prognosis. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying DAPK3-mediated
tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, we showed that the tumor suppressive
function of DAPK3 was dependent on autophagy process. Mass spectrometry, in vitro
kinase assay, and immunoprecipitation revealed that DAPK3 increased ULK1 activity
by direct ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser556. ULK1 phosphorylation by DAPK3
facilitates the ULK1 complex formation, the VPS34 complex activation, and
autophagy induction upon starvation. The kinase activity of DAPK3 and ULK1 Ser556
phosphorylation were required for DAPK3-modulated tumor suppression. The
coordinate expression of DAPK3 with ULK1 Ser556 phosphorylation was confirmed in 
clinical GC samples, and this co-expression was correlated with favorable
survival outcomes in patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that the
tumor-suppressor roles of DAPK3 in GC are associated with autophagy and that
DAPK3 is a novel autophagy regulator, which can directly phosphorylate ULK1 and
activate ULK1. Thus, DAPK3 might be a promising prognostic autophagy-associated
marker.

The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates a variety of
physiological processes, including cell growth and cancer progression. The
regulatory mechanisms of these signals are extremely complex and comprise many
feedback loops. Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ovarian tumor
domain-containing protein 5 (OTUD5) as a novel positive regulator of the mTOR
complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 signaling pathways. We demonstrated that OTUD5 stabilized
β-transducin repeat-containing protein 1 (βTrCP1) proteins via its deubiquitinase
(DUB) activity, leading to the degradation of Disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin 
domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), which is an inhibitory
protein of mTORC1 and 2. We also showed that mTOR directly phosphorylated OTUD5
and activated its DUB activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that OTUD5
regulates the downstream gene expression of mTOR. Additionally, OTUD5 depletion
elicited several mTOR-related phenotypes such as decreased cell size and
increased autophagy in mammalian cells as well as the suppression of a
dRheb-induced curled wing phenotype by RNA interference of Duba, a fly ortholog
of OTUD5, in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, OTUD5 knockdown inhibited the 
proliferation of the cancer cell lines with mutations activating mTOR pathway.
Our results suggested a positive feedback loop between OTUD5 and mTOR signaling
pathway.

Telomeres are transcribed into telomeric RNA termed as TERRA. However, the
transcription itself and excessive TERRA may interfere with telomere replication 
during S phase. The mechanism that coordinates telomere transcription and
replication is unknown. Here, we report that TCOF1 leaves the nucleolus and is
recruited to telomeres specifically during S phase by interacting with TRF2.
Therein, TCOF1 acts to suppress telomere transcription by binding and inhibiting 
Pol II. Thus, TERRA is limited to low levels in S phase. Depletion of TCOF1 leads
to abnormally elevated TERRA and formation of DNA/RNA hybrids (R-loops) at
telomeres, which induces replication fork stalling and fragile telomeres.
Importantly, telomere replication defect induced by TCOF1 deficiency can be
rescued by either masking TERRA or expressing an R-loop eraser RNase H1,
demonstrating a critical role of TCOF1 in coordinating telomere transcription and
replication. These findings link nucleolus to telomeres and uncover a novel
function of TCOF1 on ensuring telomere integrity.

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal
biogenesis. The post-translational phosphorylation modulations of TFEB by mTOR
and ERK signaling can determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and activity in
response to nutrient availability. However, regulations of TFEB at translational 
level are rarely known. Here, we found that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a
tumor suppressor, decreased levels of nuclear TFEB to inhibit lysosome biogenesis
and function. Mechanistically, PDCD4 reduces global pool of TFEB by suppressing
TFEB translation in an eIF4A-dependent manner, rather than influencing mTOR- and 
ERK2-dependnet TFEB nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Both of MA3 domains within PDCD4
are required for TFEB translation inhibition. Furthermore, TFEB is required for
PDCD4-mediated lysosomal function suppression. In the tumor microenvironment,
PDCD4 deficiency promotes the anti-tumor effect of macrophage via enhancing TFEB 
expression. Our research reveals a novel PDCD4-dependent TFEB translational
regulation and supports PDCD4 as a potential therapeutic target for lysosome
dysfunction related diseases.

CRSP8 plays an important role in recruiting mediators to genes through direct
interaction with various DNA-bound transactivators. In this study, we uncovered
the unique function of CRSP8 in suppressing thyroid cancer differentiation and
promoting thyroid cancer progression via targeting IKKα signaling. CRSP8 was
highly expressed in human thyroid cancer cells and tissues, especially in
anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Knockdown of CRSP8 suppressed cell growth,
migration, invasion, stemness, and induced apoptosis and differentiation in ATC
cells, while its overexpression displayed opposite effects in differentiated
thyroid cancer (DTC) cells. Mechanistically, CRSP8 downregulated IKKα expression 
by binding to the IKKα promoter region (-257 to -143) to negatively regulate its 
transcription. Knockdown or overexpression of IKKα significantly reversed the
expression changes of the differentiation and EMT-related markers and cell growth
changes mediated by CRSP8 knockdown or overexpression in ATC or DTC cells. The in
vivo study also validated that CRSP8 knockdown inhibited the growth of thyroid
cancer by upregulating IKKα signaling in a mouse model of human ATC. Furthermore,
we found that CRSP8 regulated the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to
chemotherapeutics, including cisplatin and epirubicin. Collectively, our results 
demonstrated that CRSP8 functioned as a modulator of IKKα signaling and a
suppressor of thyroid cancer differentiation, suggesting a potential therapeutic 
strategy for ATC by targeting CRSP8/IKKα pathway.

In addition to the role of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in facilitating
tumour cells escape from immune surveillance, it is considered as a crucial
effector in transducing intrinsic signals to promote tumour development. Our
previous study has pointed out that PD-L1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cell proliferation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we first
demonstrated that PD-L1 expression levels were positively correlated with p-MerTK
levels in patient samples and NSCLC cell lines. In addition, PD-L1 knockdown led 
to the reduced phosphorylation level of MerTK in vitro. We next showed that PD-L1
regulated NSCLC cell proliferation via Gas6/MerTK signaling pathway in vitro and 
in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we unexpectedly found that
PD-L1 translocated into the nucleus of cancer cells which was facilitated through
the binding of Karyopherin β1 (KPNB1). Nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1), coupled with
transcription factor Sp1, regulated the synthesis of Gas6 mRNA and promoted Gas6 
secretion to activate MerTK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results shed
light on the novel role of nPD-L1 in NSCLC cell proliferation and reveal a new
molecular mechanism underlying nPD-L1-mediated Gas6/MerTK signaling activation.
All above findings provide the possible combinational implications for PD-L1
targeted immunotherapy in the clinic.

Inactivation of tumor suppressor Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)
plays an important role during early tumorigenesis. However, posttranslational
modifications (PTM)-based mechanism for the inactivation of RUNX3 under hypoxia
is still not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism that G9a,
lysine-specific methyltransferase (KMT), modulates RUNX3 through PTM under
hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly increased G9a protein level and G9a interacted
with RUNX3 Runt domain, which led to increased methylation of RUNX3 at K129 and
K171. This methylation inactivated transactivation activity of RUNX3 by reducing 
interactions with CBFβ and p300 cofactors, as well as reducing acetylation of
RUNX3 by p300, which is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport by importin-α1.
G9a-mediated methylation of RUNX3 under hypoxia promotes cancer cell
proliferation by increasing cell cycle or cell division, while suppresses immune 
response and apoptosis, thereby promoting tumor growth during early
tumorigenesis. Our results demonstrate the molecular mechanism of RUNX3
inactivation by G9a-mediated methylation for cell proliferation and antiapoptosis
under hypoxia, which can be a therapeutic or preventive target to control tumor
growth during early tumorigenesis.

T-LAK-originated protein kinase (TOPK) overexpression is a feature of multiple
cancers, yet is absent from most phenotypically normal tissues. As such, TOPK
expression profiling and the development of TOPK-targeting pharmaceutical agents 
have raised hopes for its future potential in the development of targeted
therapeutics. Results presented in this paper confirm the value of TOPK as a
potential target for the treatment of solid tumours, and demonstrate the efficacy
of a TOPK inhibitor (OTS964) when used in combination with radiation treatment.
Using H460 and Calu-6 lung cancer xenograft models, we show that pharmaceutical
inhibition of TOPK potentiates the efficacy of fractionated irradiation.
Furthermore, we provide in vitro evidence that TOPK plays a hitherto unknown role
during S phase, showing that TOPK depletion increases fork stalling and collapse 
under conditions of replication stress and exogenous DNA damage. Transient
knockdown of TOPK was shown to impair recovery from fork stalling and to increase
the formation of replication-associated single-stranded DNA foci in H460 lung
cancer cells. We also show that TOPK interacts directly with CHK1 and Cdc25c, two
key players in the checkpoint signalling pathway activated after replication fork
collapse. This study thus provides novel insights into the mechanism by which
TOPK activity supports the survival of cancer cells, facilitating checkpoint
signalling in response to replication stress and DNA damage.

To survive proteotoxic stress, cancer cells activate the proteotoxic-stress
response pathway, which is controlled by the transcription factor heat shock
factor 1 (HSF1). This pathway supports cancer initiation, cancer progression and 
chemoresistance and thus is an attractive therapeutic target. As developing
inhibitors against transcriptional regulators, such as HSF1 is challenging, the
identification and targeting of upstream regulators of HSF1 present a tractable
alternative strategy. Here we demonstrate that in triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cells, the dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2)
phosphorylates HSF1, promoting its nuclear stability and transcriptional
activity. DYRK2 depletion reduces HSF1 activity and sensitises TNBC cells to
proteotoxic stress. Importantly, in tumours from TNBC patients, DYRK2 levels
positively correlate with active HSF1 and associates with poor prognosis,
suggesting that DYRK2 could be promoting TNBC. These findings identify DYRK2 as a
key modulator of the HSF1 transcriptional programme and a potential therapeutic
target.

Spermatogenesis is an important cellular differentiation process that produces
the male gametes and remains active throughout the individual's lifespan. Sertoli
cell-only syndrome (SCO) refers to the dysfunction of the male reproductive
system, including infertility. Accurate self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells
(SSCs) is essential to prevent SCO syndrome. This study investigated the role of 
microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family member 4 (MAST4) in
spermatogenesis in mice. MAST4 was localized in Sertoli cells before puberty,
providing a somatic niche for spermatogenesis in mice and MAST4 expression
shifted to Leydig cells and spermatids throughout puberty. Mast4 knockout (KO)
testes were reduced in size compared to wild-type testes, and germ cell depletion
associated with an increase in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubular structure
were similar to the SCO phenotype. In addition, MAST4 phosphorylated the
Ets-related molecule (ERM), specifically the serine 367 residue. The
phosphorylation of ERM ultimately controls the transcription of ERM target genes 
related to SSC self-renewal. The expression of spermatogenesis-associated
proteins was significantly decreased whereas Sertoli cell markers were increased 
in Mast4 KO testes, which was well-founded by RNA-sequencing analysis. Therefore,
MAST4 is associated with the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/ERM pathway and
this association helps us explore the capacity of SSCs to maintain a vertebrate
stem cell niche.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the lymph node (LN) microenvironment
delivers critical survival signals by inducing the expression of anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 members Bcl-XL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis blockade. We
determined previously that resistance against various drugs, among which is the
clinically applied BH3 mimetic venetoclax, is dominated by upregulation of the
anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl-XL. Direct clinical targeting of Bcl-XL by, e.g.,
Navitoclax is however not desirable due to induction of thrombocytopenia. Since
the actual regulation of Bcl-XL in CLL in the context of the LN microenvironment 
is not well elucidated, we investigated various candidate LN signals to drive
Bcl-XL expression. We found a dominance for NF-κB signaling upon CD40
stimulation, which results in activation of both the canonical and non-canonical 
NF-κB signaling pathways. We demonstrate that expression of Bcl-XL is first
induced by the canonical NF-κB pathway, and subsequently boosted and continued
via non-canonical NF-κB signaling through stabilization of NIK. NF-κB subunits
p65 and p52 can both bind to the Bcl-XL promoter and activate transcription upon 
CD40 stimulation. Moreover, canonical NF-κB signaling was correlated with Bfl-1
expression, whereas Mcl-1 in contrast, was not transcriptionally regulated by
NF-κB. Finally, we applied a novel compound targeting NIK to selectively inhibit 
the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and showed that venetoclax-resistant CLL cells
were sensitized to venetoclax. In conclusion, protective signals from the CLL
microenvironment can be tipped towards apoptosis sensitivity by interfering with 
non-canonical NF-κB signaling.

Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) is an important driver of the cell mitotic
spindle required for chromosome segregation and progression into anaphase. SPAG5 
has been identified as an important proliferation marker and
chemotherapy-sensitivity predictor, especially in estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancer subtypes. Here, we report that SPAG5 is a direct target of
miR-10b-3p, and its aberrantly high expression associates with poor disease-free 
survival in two large cohorts of breast cancer patients. SPAG5 depletion strongly
impaired cancer cell cycle progression, proliferation, and migration.
Interestingly, high expression of SPAG5 pairs with a YAP/TAZ-activated signature 
in breast cancer patients. Reassuringly, the depletion of YAP, TAZ, and TEAD
strongly reduced SPAG5 expression and diminished its oncogenic effects. YAP, TAZ 
coactivators, and TEAD transcription factors are key components of the Hippo
signaling pathway involved in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis.
Furthermore, we report that SPAG5 is a direct transcriptional target of
TEAD/YAP/TAZ, and pharmacological targeting of YAP and TAZ severely reduces SPAG5
expression. Collectively, our data uncover an oncogenic feedback loop, comprising
miR-10b-3p, SPAG5, and YAP/TAZ/TEAD, which fuels the aberrant proliferation of
breast cancer.

The receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key
mediator of regulated cell death and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that
RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent organ
damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic
inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent
multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of
hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a
RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug
primidone (Liskantin®) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in 
a murine model of TNFα-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state of
cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1
activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a strong rationale for
evaluating the drug primidone in conditions of hyperinflammation in humans.

To survive proteotoxic stress, cancer cells activate the proteotoxic-stress
response pathway, which is controlled by the transcription factor heat shock
factor 1 (HSF1). This pathway supports cancer initiation, cancer progression and 
chemoresistance and thus is an attractive therapeutic target. As developing
inhibitors against transcriptional regulators, such as HSF1 is challenging, the
identification and targeting of upstream regulators of HSF1 present a tractable
alternative strategy. Here we demonstrate that in triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cells, the dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2)
phosphorylates HSF1, promoting its nuclear stability and transcriptional
activity. DYRK2 depletion reduces HSF1 activity and sensitises TNBC cells to
proteotoxic stress. Importantly, in tumours from TNBC patients, DYRK2 levels
positively correlate with active HSF1 and associates with poor prognosis,
suggesting that DYRK2 could be promoting TNBC. These findings identify DYRK2 as a
key modulator of the HSF1 transcriptional programme and a potential therapeutic
target.

Upregulation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) helps tumor cells escape from
immune surveillance, and therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have shown
better patient outcomes only in several types of malignancies. Recent studies
suggest that the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments is associated
with PD-L1 levels; however, the underlying mechanism of high PD-L1 protein levels
in cancers is not well defined. Here, we report that the deubiquitinase OTUB1
positively regulates PD-L1 stability and mediates cancer immune responses through
the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that OTUB1 interacts with
and removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from the PD-L1 intracellular domain in a 
manner dependent on its deubiquitinase activity to hinder the degradation of
PD-L1 through the ERAD pathway. Functionally, depletion of OTUB1 markedly
decreases PD-L1 abundance, reduces PD-1 protein binding to the tumor cell
surface, and causes increased tumor cell sensitivity to human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)-mediated cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, OTUB1
ablation-induced PD-L1 destabilization facilitates more CD8+ T cells infiltration
and increases the level of IFN-γ in serum to enhance antitumor immunity in mice, 
and the tumor growth suppression by OTUB1 silencing could be reversed by PD-L1
overexpression. Furthermore, we observe a significant correlation between PD-L1
abundance and OTUB1 expression in human breast carcinoma. Our study reveals OTUB1
as a deubiquitinating enzyme that influences cancer immunosuppression via
regulation of PD-L1 stability and may be a potential therapeutic target for
cancer immunotherapy.

Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase harboring
multiple cellular functions. We found that the TRIM28 protein is frequently
overexpressed in patients with lung cancer. The stable overexpression of TRIM28
in lung cancer cells and xenograft models significantly increased the
proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, whereas knockdown of TRIM28 had the
opposite effect. We further observed that TRIM28 regulates the ubiquitin ligases 
RLIM and MDM2 to target the p53 levels during lung tumorigenesis. These data
provide new insights into lung cancer development and potential new therapeutic
targets for this disease.

Caspase-8-cleaved Bid (cBid) associates with mitochondria and promotes the
activation of BAX, leading to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
and apoptosis. However, current structural models of cBid are largely based on
studies using membrane vesicles and detergent micelles. Here we employ spin-label
ESR and site-directed PEGylation methods to identify conformations of cBid at
real mitochondrial membranes, revealing stepwise mechanisms in the activation
process. Upon the binding of cBid to mitochondria, its structure is reorganized
to expose the BH3 domain while leaving the structural integrity only slightly
altered. The mitochondria-bound cBid is in association with Mtch2 and it remains 
in the primed state until interacting with BAX. The interaction subsequently
triggers the fragmentation of cBid, causes large conformational changes, and
promotes BAX-mediated MOMP. Our results reveal structural differences of cBid
between mitochondria and other lipid-like environments and, moreover, highlight
the role of the membrane binding in modifying cBid structure and assisting the
inactive-to-active transition in function.

Site-1 protease (S1P) is a Golgi-located protein that activates unique
membrane-bound latent transcription factors, and it plays an indispensable role
in endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response and
lysosome function. A patient with S1P mutation exhibits severe skeletal dysplasia
with kyphoscoliosis, dysmorphic facial features and pectus carinatum. However,
whether S1P regulates bone remodeling by affecting osteoclastogenesis remains
elusive. Here, we show that S1P is indeed a positive regulator of
osteoclastogenesis. S1P ablation in mice led to significant osteosclerosis
compared with wild-type littermates. Mechanistically, S1P showed upregulated
during osteoclastogenesis and was identified as a direct target of miR-9-5p. S1P 
deletion in bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) inhibited ATF6 and SREBP2 maturation,
which subsequently impeded CHOP/SREBP2-complex-induced LC3 expression and
autophagy flux. Consistently, transfection of LC3 adenovirus evidently rescued
osteoclastogenesis in S1P-deficient BMMs. We then identified the interaction
regions between CHOP and SREBP2 by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and molecular
docking. Furthermore, S1P deletion or inhibitor efficaciously rescued
ovariectomized (OVX)- and LPS-induced bone loss in vivo. Collectively, we showed 
that S1P regulates osteoclast differentiation in a LC3 dependent manner and so is
a potential therapy target for osteoporosis.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies 
and cause of death from cancer in China. Previous studies showed that autophagy
and apoptosis inhibition are critical for the survival of ESCC cells. However,
the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. Recently, we found that PIWIL2,
a novel cancer testis protein, is highly expressed in ESCC and associated with
high T-stage and poor 5-year survival rate in patients. Our further study showed 
that PIWIL2 can directly bind to IKK and promote its phosphorylation, leading to 
phosphorylation of IκB and subsequently nuclear translocation of NF-κB for
apoptosis inhibition. Meanwhile, PIWIL2 competitively inhibits binding of IKK to 
TSC1, and thus deactivate mTORC1 pathway which suppresses ULK1 phosphorylation
and initiation of autophagy. The mouse xenograft model suggested that PIWIL2 can 
promote ESCC growth in an IKK-dependent manner. This present work firstly
revealed that PIWIL2 can play a role in regulating autophagy and apoptosis, and
is associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients, providing novel insights into
the roles of PIWIL2 in tumorigenesis.

Protein Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (Prame), a tumor-associated 
antigen, has been found to frequently overexpress in various cancers, which
indicates advanced cancer stages and poor clinical prognosis. Moreover, previous 
reports noted that Prame functions as a substrate recognizing receptor protein of
Cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs) to mediate potential substrates degradation through
Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). However, none of the Prame specific substrate 
has been identified so far. In this study, proteomic analysis of RBX1-interacting
proteins revealed p14/ARF, a well-known tumor suppressor, as a novel ubiquitin
target of RBX1. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation and in vivo ubiquitination
assay determined Cullin2-RBX1-Transcription Elongation Factor B Subunit 2 (EloB) 
assembled CRL2 E3 ligase complex to regulate the ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation of p14/ARF. Finally, through siRNA screening, Prame was identified as
the specific receptor protein responsible for recognizing p14/ARF to be degraded.
Additionally, via bioinformatics analysis of TCGA database and clinical samples, 
Prame was determined to overexpress in tumor tissues vs. paired adjacent tissues 
and associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. As such, downregulation of
Prame expression significantly restrained cancer cell growth by inducing G2/M
phase cell cycle arrest, which could be rescued by simultaneously knocking down
of p14/ARF. Altogether, targeting overexpressed Prame in cancer cells inactivated
RBX1-Cullin2-EloB-Prame E3 ligase (CRL2Prame) and halted p14/ARF degradation to
restrain tumor growth by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest.

Hedgehog signaling plays a pivotal role in embryonic pattern formation and
diverse aspects of the postnatal biological process. Perturbation of the hedgehog
pathway and overexpression of GLI1, a downstream transcription factor in the
hedgehog pathway, are highly relevant to several malignancies including
chondrosarcoma (CS). We previously found that knocking down expression of GLI1
attenuates the disrupted Indian hedgehog (IHH) signal pathway and suppresses cell
survival in human CS cells. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the
expression of GLI1 are still unknown. Here, we demonstrated the implication of
GLI1 in SMO-independent pathways in CS cells. A GLI1 binding protein, major vault
protein (MVP), was identified using the affinity purification method. MVP
promoted the nuclear transport and stabilization of GLI1 by compromising the
binding affinity of GLI1 with suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) and increased
GLI1 expression via mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascade. Functionally, knockdown of MVP
suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis. Simultaneous inhibition of MVP and 
GLI1 strongly inhibits the growth of CS in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, IHC
results showed that MVP, GLI1, and P-p70S6K1 were highly expressed and positively
correlated with each other in 71 human CS tissues. Overall, our findings revealed
a novel regulating mechanism for HH-independent GLI1 expression and provide a
rationale for combination therapy in patients with advanced CS.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates many distinct biological processes. Its
dysregulation causes various diseases, including but not limited to cancer. In
this study, based on the analysis of gene expression in several colorectal cancer
(CRC) datasets, we show that FBXL6, a poorly-characterized F-box protein, is
amplified, over-expressed, and highly correlated with poor prognosis in human CRC
patients. Mechanistically, FBXL6 targets phospho-p53 (S315) to mediate its
polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting p53 signaling.
FBXL6 depletion inhibits proliferation of p53 wild-type (WT) CRC cells by
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 transcriptionally
suppresses FBXL6 expression by binding its core promoter region. Taken together, 
these results identify the feed-forward loop of FBXL6-p53 as a potential
therapeutic target for CRC treatments.

Radioresistance is regarded as the main barrier to effective radiotherapy in lung
cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of radioresistance remain elusive.
Here, we show that lysine-specific demethylase 4C (KDM4C) is overexpressed and
correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. We provide evidence that 
genetical or pharmacological inhibition of KDM4C impairs tumorigenesis and
radioresistance in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we uncover that
KDM4C upregulates TGF-β2 expression by directly reducing H3K9me3 level at the
TGF-β2 promoter and then activates Smad/ATM/Chk2 signaling to confer
radioresistance in lung cancer. Using tandem affinity purification technology, we
further identify deubiquitinase USP9X as a critical binding partner that
deubiquitinates and stabilizes KDM4C. More importantly, depletion of USP9X
impairs TGF-β2/Smad signaling and radioresistance by destabilizing KDM4C in lung 
cancer cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that USP9X-mediated KDM4C
deubiquitination activates TGF-β2/Smad signaling to promote radioresistance,
suggesting that targeting KDM4C may be a promising radiosensitization strategy in
the treatment of lung cancer.

Emerging evidence suggests that USP39 plays an important role in the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism by which
USP39 promotes HCC progression has not been well defined, especially regarding
its putative ubiquitination function. Zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)
is a crucial inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote
tumor proliferation and metastasis, but the regulatory mechanism of ZEB1
stability in HCC remains enigmatic. Here, we reveal that USP39 is highly
expressed in human HCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover,
USP39 depletion inhibits HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by promoting ZEB1 
degradation. Intriguingly, deubiquitinase USP39 has a direct interaction with the
E3 ligase TRIM26 identified by co-immunoprecipitation assays and
immunofluorescence staining assays. We further demonstrate that TRIM26 is lowly
expressed in human HCC tissues and inhibits HCC cell proliferation and migration.
TRIM26 promotes the degradation of ZEB1 protein by ubiquitination in HCC.
Deubiquitinase USP39 and E3 ligase TRIM26 function in an antagonistic pattern,
but not a competitive pattern, and play key roles in controlling ZEB1 stability
to determine the HCC progression. In summary, our data reveal a previously
unknown mechanism that USP39 and TRIM26 balance the level of ZEB1 ubiquitination 
and thereby determine HCC cell proliferation and migration. This novel mechanism 
may provide new approaches to target treatment for inhibiting HCC development by 
restoring TRIM26 or suppressing USP39 expression in HCC cases with high ZEB1
protein levels.

Small nucleolar RNA SNORD50A and SNORD50B (SNORD50A/B) has been reported to be
recurrently deleted and function as a putative tumor suppressor in different
types of cancer by binding to and suppressing the activity of the KRAS
oncoproteins. Its deletion correlates with poorer patient survival. However, in
this study, we surprisingly found that SNORD50A/B loss predicted a better
survival in breast cancer patients carrying wild-type p53. Functional studies
showed that SNORD50A/B deletion strongly inhibited the proliferation, migration, 
invasion and tumorigenic potential, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in p53 wild-type breast cancer cells, while exerted the opposite effects in p53
mutated breast cancer cells. This was also supported by ectopically expressing
SNORD50A/B in both p53 wild-type and mutated breast cancer cells.
Mechanistically, SNORD50A/B clearly enhances the interaction between E3 ubiquitin
ligase TRIM21 and its substrate GMPS by forming a complex among them, thereby
promoting GMPS ubiquitination and its subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration.
SNORD50A/B deletion in p53 wild-type breast cancer cells will release GMPS and
induce the translocation of GMPS into the nucleus, where GMPS can recruit USP7
and form a complex with p53, thereby decreasing p53 ubiquitination, stabilizing
p53 proteins, and inhibiting malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Altogether,
the present study first reports that SNORD50A/B plays an oncogenic role in p53
wild-type breast cancers by mediating TRIM21-GMPS interaction.

Emerging evidence suggests that USP39 plays an important role in the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism by which
USP39 promotes HCC progression has not been well defined, especially regarding
its putative ubiquitination function. Zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1)
is a crucial inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote
tumor proliferation and metastasis, but the regulatory mechanism of ZEB1
stability in HCC remains enigmatic. Here, we reveal that USP39 is highly
expressed in human HCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover,
USP39 depletion inhibits HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by promoting ZEB1 
degradation. Intriguingly, deubiquitinase USP39 has a direct interaction with the
E3 ligase TRIM26 identified by co-immunoprecipitation assays and
immunofluorescence staining assays. We further demonstrate that TRIM26 is lowly
expressed in human HCC tissues and inhibits HCC cell proliferation and migration.
TRIM26 promotes the degradation of ZEB1 protein by ubiquitination in HCC.
Deubiquitinase USP39 and E3 ligase TRIM26 function in an antagonistic pattern,
but not a competitive pattern, and play key roles in controlling ZEB1 stability
to determine the HCC progression. In summary, our data reveal a previously
unknown mechanism that USP39 and TRIM26 balance the level of ZEB1 ubiquitination 
and thereby determine HCC cell proliferation and migration. This novel mechanism 
may provide new approaches to target treatment for inhibiting HCC development by 
restoring TRIM26 or suppressing USP39 expression in HCC cases with high ZEB1
protein levels.

The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, and there is no
disease-modifying agent for PD. Withaferin A (WA), a naturally occurring
compound, has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the mechanisms by
which WA is neuroprotective in PD are unknown. Here we show that WA protected
against loss of dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits in
MPTP-induced PD mouse models. Whole-genome deep sequencing analysis combined with
Meta-analysis of human PD studies reveal that DJ1, Nrf2, and STING in substantia 
nigra pars compacta (SNc) are linked to anti-PD effect of WA. We found that WA
activated DJ1 and Nrf2, and suppressed STING within SNc; and overexpression of
STING in SNc dampened the effect of WA. Using genetically modified mice (DJ1-KO, 
Nrf2-KO, STINGgt/gt and STING-KO) and immunolabeling technique, we identified
that WA targeted DJ1-Nrf2-STING pathway in dopaminergic neurons; and we
demonstrate that STING might be an important factor in PD pathogenesis. In
addition, WA alleviated accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn) and 
insoluble α-syn within SNc in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated human α-syn
overexpression PD model. Our comparative analysis on whole-genome transcriptome
profiles suggests that STING might be a key target of WA and amantadine in PD
treatment. This study highlights a multifaceted role for WA in neuroprotection,
and suggests that WA can be a potential candidate for treatment of PD.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a main cause of mortality and severe
neurologic impairment in the perinatal and neonatal period. However, few
satisfactory therapeutic strategies are available. Here, we reported that a rapid
nuclear translocation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN
(PTEN) is an essential step in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD)- and
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal injures both in vivo and in
vitro. In addition, we found that OGD-induced nuclear translocation of PTEN is
dependent on PTEN mono-ubiquitination at the lysine 13 residue (K13) that is
mediated by neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein
4-1 (NEDD4-1). Importantly, we for the first time identified α- and γ-adaptin
binding protein (Aagab) as a novel NEDD4-1 regulator to regulate the level of
NEDD4-1, subsequently mediating Pten nuclear translocation. Finally, we
demonstrated that genetic upregulation of Aagab or application of Tat-K13 peptide
(a short interference peptide that flanks K13 residue of PTEN) not only reduced
Pten nuclear translocation, but also significantly alleviated the deficits of
myodynamia, motor and spatial learning and memory in HIBD model rats. These
results suggest that Aagab may serve as a regulator of NEDD4-1-mediated Pten
nuclear translocation to promote functional recovery following HIBD in neonatal
rats, and provide a new potential therapeutic target to guide the clinical
treatment for HIE.

Drug resistance has remained an important issue in the treatment and prevention
of various diseases, including cancer. Herein, we found that USP24 not only
repressed DNA-damage repair (DDR) activity by decreasing Rad51 expression to
cause the tumor genomic instability and cancer stemness, but also increased the
levels of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-gp, ABCG2, and ezrin to
enhance the pumping out of Taxol from cancer cells, thus resulted in drug
resistance during cancer therapy. A novel USP24 inhibitor, NCI677397, was
screened for specific inhibiting the catalytic activity of USP24. This inhibitor 
was identified to suppress drug resistance via decreasing genomic instability,
cancer stemness, and the pumping out of drugs from cancer cells. Understanding
the role and molecular mechanisms of USP24 in drug resistance will be beneficial 
for the future development of a novel USP24 inhibitor. Our studies provide a new 
insight of USP24 inhibitor for clinically implication of blocking drug resistance
during chemotherapy.

Hevin, also known as SPARC-like protein 1 (SPARCL1 or SC1), is a synaptogenic
protein secreted by astrocytes and modulates the formation of glutamatergic
synapses in the developing brain by interacting with synaptic adhesion proteins, 
such as neurexin and neuroligin. Here, we identified the neuron-specific
vesicular protein calcyon as a novel interaction partner of hevin and
demonstrated that this interaction played a pivotal role in synaptic
reorganization after an injury in the mature brain. Astrocytic hevin was
upregulated post-injury in a photothrombotic stroke model. Hevin was fragmented
by MMP3 induced during the acute stage of brain injury, and this process was
associated with severe gliosis. At the late stage, the functional hevin level was
restored as MMP3 expression decreased. The C-terminus of hevin interacted with
the N-terminus of calcyon. By using RNAi and binding competitor peptides in an
ischemic brain injury model, we showed that this interaction was crucial in
synaptic and functional recoveries in the sensory-motor cortex, based on
histological and electrophysiological analyses. Regulated expression of hevin and
calcyon and interaction between them were confirmed in a mouse model of traumatic
brain injury and patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Our study
provides direct evidence for the causal relationship between the hevin-calcyon
interaction and synaptic reorganization after brain injury. This neuron-glia
interaction can be exploited to modulate synaptic reorganization under various
neurological conditions.

The prerequisite function of vimentin for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) is not clearly elucidated yet. Here, we show that vimentin phosphorylated
by PLK1, triggers TGF-β-signaling, which consequently leads to metastasis and
PD-L1 expression for immune suppression in lung adenocarcinoma. The clinical
correlation between expression of both vimentin and PLK1, and overall survival
rates of patients was significant in lung adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell
carcinoma. The phosphorylation of vimentin was accompanied by the activation of
PLK1 during TGF-β-induced EMT in lung adenocarcinoma. Among the several
phosphorylation sites determined by phospho-proteomic analysis and the
site-specific mutagenesis, the phosphorylation at S339 displayed the most
effective metastasis and tumourigenesis with the highest expression of PD-L1,
compared with that of wild-type and other versions in both 3D cell culture and
tail-vein injection metastasis models. Phosphomimetic vimentin at S339 interacted
with p-Smad2 for its nuclear localization, leading to the expression of PD-L1.
Clinical relevance revealed the inverse correlation between the survival rates of
patients and the expressions of VIM, PLK1, and CD274 in primary and metastatic
lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin activates
TGF-β signaling pathway, leading to the metastasis and immune escape through the 
expression of PD-L1, functioning as a shuttling protein in lung adenocarcinoma.

The biological function of PRMT5 remains poorly understood in cervical cancer
metastasis. Here, we report that PRMT5 physically associates with the
transcription factor Snail and the NuRD(MTA1) complex to form a
transcriptional-repressive complex that catalyzes the symmetrical histone
dimethylation and deacetylation. This study shows that the Snail/PRMT5/NuRD(MTA1)
complex targets genes, such as TET1 and E-cadherin, which are critical for
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This complex also affects the conversion
of 5mC to 5hmC. This study demonstrates that the Snail/PRMT5/NuRD(MTA1) complex
promotes the invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo.
This study also shows that PRMT5 expression is upregulated in cervical cancer and
various human cancers, and the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 suppresses EMT and the
invasion potential of cervical cancer cells by disinhibiting the expression of
TET1 and increasing 5hmC, suggesting that PRMT5 is a potential target for cancer 
therapy.

Here, we provide evidence that high ATP production by the mitochondrial
ATP-synthase is a new therapeutic target for anticancer therapy, especially for
preventing tumor progression. More specifically, we isolated a subpopulation of
ATP-high cancer cells which are phenotypically aggressive and demonstrate
increases in proliferation, stemness, anchorage-independence, cell migration,
invasion and multi-drug resistance, as well as high antioxidant capacity.
Clinically, these findings have important implications for understanding
treatment failure and cancer cell dormancy. Using bioinformatic analysis of
patient samples, we defined a mitochondrial-related gene signature for
metastasis, which features the gamma-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase
(ATP5F1C). The relationship between ATP5F1C protein expression and metastasis was
indeed confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Next, we used MDA-MB-231 cells as a
model system to functionally validate these findings. Importantly, ATP-high
MDA-MB-231 cells showed a nearly fivefold increase in metastatic capacity in
vivo. Consistent with these observations, ATP-high cells overexpressed (i)
components of mitochondrial complexes I-V, including ATP5F1C, and (ii) markers
associated with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastasis, such as EpCAM and 
VCAM1. Knockdown of ATP5F1C expression significantly reduced ATP-production,
anchorage-independent growth, and cell migration, as predicted. Similarly,
therapeutic administration of the FDA-approved drug, Bedaquiline, downregulated
ATP5F1C expression in vitro and prevented spontaneous metastasis in vivo. In
contrast, Bedaquiline had no effect on the growth of non-tumorigenic mammary
epithelial cells (MCF10A) or primary tumors in vivo. Taken together, our results 
suggest that mitochondrial ATP depletion is a new therapeutic strategy for
metastasis prophylaxis, to avoid treatment failure. In summary, we conclude that 
mitochondrial ATP5F1C is a promising new biomarker and molecular target for
future drug development, for the prevention of metastatic disease progression.

The aberrant classical miRNAs are considered to play significant roles in tumor
progression. However, it remains unclear for nonclassical miRNAs, a set of
Drosha-independent miRNAs in the process of various biology. Here, we reveal that
a nonclassical miR-4646-5p plays a pivotal role in gastric cancer (GC)
metastasis. MiR-4646-5p, one of Drosha-independent mirtronic miRNA, is aberrant
up-regulated in Drosha-low expressed GC and Drosha-knockdown gastric cancer
cells. Mirtronic miR-4646-5p is a specific transcription splicing product of
intron 3 of the host gene Abhd16a with the aid of SRSF2. The enhanced miR-4646-5p
can stabilize HIF1A by targeting PHD3 to positive feedback regulate Abhd16a and
miR-4646-5p itself expressions. ABHD16A, as an emerging
phosphatidylserine-specific lipase, involves in lipid metabolism leading to
lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PSs) accumulation, which stimulates RhoA and
downstream LIMK/cofilin cascade activity through GPR34/Gi subunit, thus causes
metastasis of gastric cancer. In addition, miR-4646-5p/PHD3/HIF1A signaling can
also up-regulate RhoA expression and synergistically promote gastric cancer cell 
invasion and metastasis. Our study provides new insights of nonclassical
mirtronic miRNA on tumor progress and may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker for
gastric cancer. MiR-4646-5p and its host gene Abhd16a mediated abnormal lipid
metabolism may be a new target for clinical treatment of gastric cancer.

Wnt signaling is mainly transduced by β-catenin via regulation of the β-catenin
destruction complex containing Axin, APC, and GSK3β. Transcription factor EB
(TFEB) is a well-known master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis
processes. TFEB's nuclear localization and transcriptional activity are also
regulated by various upstream signals. In this study, we found that Wnt signaling
induces the nuclear localization of TFEB and the expression of Wnt target genes
is regulated by TFEB-β-catenin-TCF/LEF1 as well as β-catenin-TCF/LEF1 complexes. 
Our biochemical data revealed that TFEB is a part of the β-catenin destruction
complex, and destabilization of the destruction complex by knockdown of either
Axin or APC causes nuclear localization of TFEB. Interestingly, RNA-sequencing
analysis revealed that about 27% of Wnt3a-induced genes were TFEB dependent.
However, these "TFEB mediated Wnt target genes" were different from TFEB target
genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis processes. Mechanistically, 
we found that Tankyrase (TNKS) PARsylates TFEB with Wnt ON signaling, and the
nuclear localized PARsylated TFEB forms a complex with β-catenin-TCF/LEF1 to
induce the "TFEB mediated Wnt target genes". Finally, we found that in various
types of cancer, the levels of TFEB mediated Wnt target genes exhibit strong
correlations with the level of Axin2, which represents the activity of Wnt
signaling. Overall, our data suggest that Wnt signaling induces the expression of
a subset of genes that are distinct from previously known genes regulated by the 
β-catenin-TCF/LEF1 complex or TFEB, by forming a transcription factor complex
consisting of PARsylated TFEB and β-catenin-TCF/LEF1.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) regulate diverse biological processes and represent a
novel class of drug targets. However, the biological function of only a small
fraction of DUBs, especially in adaptive immune response regulation, is
well-defined. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 12
(USP12) as a critical regulator of CD4+ T cell activation. USP12 plays an
intrinsic role in promoting the CD4+ T cell phenotype, including differentiation,
activation, and proliferation. Although USP12-deficient CD4+ T cells protected
mice from autoimmune diseases, the immune response against bacterial infection
was subdued. USP12 stabilized B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) by
deubiquitinating, and thereby activated the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Interestingly, this USP12 regulatory mechanism was identified in CD4+ T cells,
but not in CD8+ T cells. Our study results showed that USP12 activated CD4+ T
cell signaling, and targeting USP12 might help develop therapeutic interventions 
for treating inflammatory diseases or pathogen infections.

Sorting nexins (SNXs), the retromer-associated cargo binding proteins, have
emerged as critical regulators of the trafficking of proteins involved in the
pathogenesis of diverse diseases. However, studies of SNXs in the development of 
cardiovascular diseases, especially cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, are
lacking. Here, we ask whether SNX3, the simplest structured isoform in the SNXs
family, may act as a key inducer of myocardial injury. An increased level of SNX3
was observed in failing hearts from human patients and mice. Cardiac-specific
Snx3 knockout (Snx3-cKO) mice and Snx3 transgenic (Snx3-cTg) mice were generated 
to evaluate the role of Snx3 in myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart
function by morphology, echocardiography, histological staining, and hypertrophic
biomarkers. We report that Snx3-cKO in mice significantly protected against
isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy at 12 weeks. Conversely, Snx3-cTg
mice were more susceptible to ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy at 12 weeks and
showed aggravated cardiac injury even heart failure at 24 weeks.
Immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry, immunofluorescent staining,
co-immunoprecipitation, localized surface plasmon resonance, and proximity
ligation assay were performed to examine the direct interaction of SNX3-retromer 
with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We discovered
that STAT3 was a new interacting partner of SNX3-retromer, and SNX3-retromer
served as an essential platform for assembling gp130/JAK2/STAT3 complexes and
subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 by direct combination at EE. SNX3-retromer
and STAT3 complexes were transiently imported into the nucleus after hypertrophic
stimuli. The pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of STAT3 reversed SNX3
overexpression-induced myocardial injury. STAT3 overexpression blunts the
beneficial function of SNX3 knockdown on hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. We show
that SNX3-retromer promoted importin α3-mediated STAT3 nuclear trafficking and
ultimately leading to cardiac injury. Taken together, our study reveals that SNX3
plays a key role in cardiac function and implicates SNX3 as a potential
therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3 or RIPK3), the critical executor of
cell programmed necrosis, plays essential roles in maintaining immune responses
and appropriate tissue homeostasis. Although the E3 ligases CHIP and PELI1 are
reported to promote RIP3 degradation, however, how post-translational
modification regulates RIP3 activity and stability is poorly understood. Here, we
identify the tripartite motif protein TRIM25 as a negative regulator of
RIP3-dependent necrosis. TRIM25 directly interacts with RIP3 through its SPRY
domain and mediates the K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP3 on residue K501.
The RING domain of TRIM25 facilitates the polyubiquitination chain on RIP3,
thereby promoting proteasomal degradation of RIP3. Also, TRIM25 deficiency
inhibited the ubiquitination of RIP3, thus promoting TNF-induced cell necrosis.
Our current finding reveals the regulating mechanism of polyubiquitination on
RIP3, which might be a potential therapeutic target for the intervention of
RIP3-dependent necrosis-related diseases.

Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is an oncogenic factor that is highly expressed in
basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and promotes cell proliferation, survival,
migration, stemness, and tumor growth; however, its posttranslational
modifications are poorly defined. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is
also an oncogene implicated in various carcinomas, including breast cancer. In
this study, we found that PRMT5 interacts with KLF5 and catalyzes the
di-methylation of KLF5 at Arginine 57 (R57) in a methyltransferase
activity-dependent manner in BLBC cells. Depletion or pharmaceutical inhibition
(using PJ-68) of PRMT5 decreased the expression of KLF5 and its downstream target
genes in vitro and in vivo. PRMT5-induced KLF5R57me2 antagonizes GSK3β-mediated
KLF5 phosphorylation and subsequently Fbw7-mediated KLF5 ubiquitination and
coupled degradation. Functionally, PRMT5 promotes breast cancer stem cell
maintenance and proliferation, at least partially, by stabilizing KLF5. PRMT5 and
KLF5 protein levels were positively correlated in clinical BLBCs. Taken together,
PRMT5 methylates KLF5 to prevent its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and
degradation, and thus promotes breast cancer stem cell maintenance and
proliferation. These findings suggest that PRMT5 is a potential therapeutic
target for BLBC.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common and lethal
human urological malignancies in the world. One of the pathological drivers for
ccRCC is the Ras family of small GTPases that function as "molecular switches" in
many diseases including ccRCC. Among the GTPases in the Di-Ras family, DIRAS2
gene encodes a GTPase that shares 60% homology to Ras and Rap. Yet little is
known about the biological function(s) of Di-Ras2 or how its activities are
regulated. In this study, we focused on Di-Ras2, and determined its functions and
underlying mechanism during formation of ccRCC. We found that Di-Ras2 was
upregulated in ccRCC, and promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of
human ccRCC cells in the absence of von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL).
Mechanistically, Di-Ras2 induces and regulates ccRCC formation by modulating
phosphorylation of the downstream effectors and activating the
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Moreover, Di-Ras2 
interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase, pVHL, which facilitates the ubiquitination
and degradation of Di-Ras2. Together, these results indicate a potential function
of Di-Ras2 as an oncogene in ccRCC, and these data provide a new perspective of
the relationship between pVHL and the MAPK pathway in ccRCC tumorigenesis.

Fusion genes resulting from chromosomal rearrangements are frequently found in a 
variety of cancer cells. Some of these are known to be driver oncogenes, such as 
BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The products of such fusion genes 
are abnormal proteins that are ordinarily degraded in cells by a mechanism known 
as protein quality control. This suggests that the degradation of BCR-ABL protein
is suppressed in CML cells to ensure their proliferative activity. Here, we show 
that ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) suppresses the degradation of BCR-ABL
protein in cells harboring Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). USP25 was found proximal
to BCR-ABL protein in cells. Depletion of USP25 using shRNA-mediated gene
silencing increased the ubiquitylated BCR-ABL, and reduced the level of BCR-ABL
protein. Accordingly, BCR-ABL-mediated signaling and cell proliferation were
suppressed in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia cells by the depletion of USP25. We
further found that pharmacological inhibition of USP25 induced rapid degradation 
of BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive leukemia cells, regardless of their sensitivity
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that USP25 is a novel
target for inducing the degradation of oncogenic BCR-ABL protein in Ph-positive
leukemia cells. This could be an effective approach to overcome resistance to
kinase inhibitors.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play crucial roles in cancer
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been known to play crucial roles in cancer
development and progression by regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression.
However, only a few lncRNAs with annotated functions in the progression of
colorectal cancer (CRC) have been identified to date. In the present study, the
expression of lncCMPK2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and positively correlated
with clinical stages and lymphatic metastasis. The overexpression of lncCMPK2
promoted the proliferation and cell cycle transition of CRC cells. Conversely,
the silencing of lncCMPK2 restricted cell proliferation both in vitro and in
vivo. lncCMPK2 was localized to the nucleus of CRC cells, bound to far upstream
element binding protein 3 (FUBP3), and guided FUBP3 to the far upstream element
(FUSE) of the c-Myc gene to activate transcription. lncCMPK2 also stabilized
FUBP3. These results provide novel insights into the functional mechanism of
lncCMPK2 in CRC progression and highlight its potential as a biomarker of
advanced CRC and therapeutic target.

Prostate cancer (PCa) innervation contributes to the progression of PCa. However,
the precise impact of innervation on PCa cells is still poorly understood. By
focusing on muscarinic receptors, which are activated by the nerve-derived
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we show that muscarinic receptors 1 and 3 (m1 and
m3) are highly expressed in PCa clinical specimens compared with all other cancer
types, and that amplification or gain of their corresponding encoding genes
(CHRM1 and CHRM3, respectively) represent a worse prognostic factor for PCa
progression free survival. Moreover, m1 and m3 gene gain or amplification is
frequent in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with hormone-sensitive PCa
(HSPC) specimens. This was reflected in HSPC-derived cells, which show aberrantly
high expression of m1 and m3 under androgen deprivation mimicking castration and 
androgen receptor inhibition. We also show that pharmacological activation of m1 
and m3 signaling is sufficient to induce the castration-resistant growth of PCa
cells. Mechanistically, we found that m1 and m3 stimulation induces YAP
activation through FAK, whose encoding gene, PTK2 is frequently amplified in CRPC
cases. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK and knockdown of YAP abolished m1 and
m3-induced castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Our findings provide novel
therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic-signal-driven CRPC progression by
targeting the FAK-YAP signaling axis.

A Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), is
known to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancer types; however, whether
DLC1 is a tumor-suppressor gene or an oncogene in melanoma remains to be
clarified. Here we revealed that high DLC1 expression was detected in most of the
melanoma tissues where it was localized in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm.
Functional studies unveiled that DLC1 was both required and sufficient for
melanoma growth and metastasis. These tumorigenic events were mediated by
nuclear-localized DLC1 in a RhoGAP-independent manner. Mechanistically, mass
spectrometry analysis identified a DLC1-associated protein, FOXK1 transcription
factor, which mediated oncogenic events in melanoma by translocating and
retaining DLC1 into the nucleus. RNA-sequencing profiling studies further
revealed MMP9 as a direct target of FOXK1 through DLC1-regulated promoter
occupancy for cooperative activation of MMP9 expression to promote melanoma
invasion and metastasis. Concerted action of DLC1-FOXK1 in MMP9 gene regulation
was further supported by their highly correlated expression in melanoma patients'
samples and cell lines. Together, our results not only unravel a mechanism by
which nuclear DLC1 functions as an oncogene in melanoma but also suggest an
unexpected role of RhoGAP protein in transcriptional regulation.

Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), the key enzyme of
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, has been reported to promote
colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis by upregulating the MEK-ERK signaling
pathway. However, the profile of BCKDK in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
remains unknown. Here, we report a novel role of BCKDK in mCRC. BCKDK is
upregulated in CRC tissues. Increased BCKDK expression was associated with
metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in CRC patients. Knockdown of BCKDK
decreased CRC cell migration and invasion ex vivo, and lung metastasis in vivo.
BCKDK promoted the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, by decreasing
the expression of E-cadherin, epithelial marker, and increasing the expression of
N-cadherin and Vimentin, which are mesenchymal markers. Moreover, BCKDK-knockdown
experiments in combination with phosphoproteomics analysis revealed the potent
role of BCKDK in modulating multiple signal transduction pathways, including EMT 
and metastasis. Src phosphorylated BCKDK at the tyrosine 246 (Y246) site in vitro
and ex vivo. Knockdown and knockout of Src downregulated the phosphorylation of
BCKDK. Importantly, phosphorylation of BCKDK by Src enhanced the activity and
stability of BCKDK, thereby promoting the migration, invasion, and EMT of CRC
cells. In summary, the identification of BCKDK as a novel prometastatic factor in
human CRC will be beneficial for further diagnostic biomarker studies and
suggests novel targeting opportunities.

Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)
is caused by solar ultraviolet (SUV) exposure and is the most common cancer in
the United States. T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a
serine-threonine kinase is activated by SUV irradiation and involved in skin
carcinogenesis. Strategies with research focusing on the TOPK signaling pathway
and targeted therapy in skin carcinogenesis may helpful for the discovery of
additional treatments against skin cancer. In this study, we found that TOPK can 
directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Jun (as one of the core member of AP-1) at
Ser63 and Ser73 after SSL exposure in a JNKs-independent manner. TOPK knocking
down, or HI-TOPK-032 (TOPK specific inhibitor) attenuated colony formation and
cell proliferation of skin cancer cells. Phosphorylated levels of c-Jun were
overexpressed in human AK and cSCC compared with normal skin tissues, and
HI-TOPK-032 inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun in SCC cell line in a
dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HI-TOPK-032 decreased SSL-induced AP-1
transactivation activity. Moreover, acute SSL-induced inflammation was attenuated
by the topical application of HI-TOPK-032 in SKH1 hairless mice. Importantly,
HI-TOPK-032 suppressed chronic SSL-induced skin carcinogenesis and c-Jun
phosphorylation levels in SKH1 hairless mice. Our results demonstrate that TOPK
can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the process of skin
carcinogenesis and HI-TOPK-032 could be used as a potential chemopreventive drug 
against cSCC development.

CD147, also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is
a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in tumor cells,
particularly melanoma cells, and plays critical roles in tumor cell metastasis
through the regulation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression. In this study,
we identified Fyn as a novel interacting protein of CD147. Fyn is a member of the
Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulates diverse physiological
processes, such as T lymphocyte differentiation, through the TCR signaling
pathway. Our findings demonstrated that Fyn directly phosphorylates CD147 at Y140
and Y183. Two phosphospecific antibodies against Y140 and Y183 were developed to 
validate the phosphorylation of CD147 by Fyn. Moreover, the CD147-FF
(Y140F/Y183F) mutation impaired the interaction between CD147 and GnT-V, leading 
to decreased CD147 glycosylation and membrane recruitment. In addition, CD147-FF 
significantly blocked MMP-9 expression as well as cell migration. Moreover, we
found that Fyn is overexpressed in clinical melanoma tissues as well as in
melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of Fyn expression markedly attenuated the
malignant phenotype of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo through downregulation
of CD147 phosphorylation, indicating that Fyn/CD147 is a potential target
molecule in melanoma treatment. Finally, through virtual screening, we identified
amodiaquine as a potential inhibitor targeting the Fyn/CD147 axis. Amodiaquine
treatment dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of CD147 by Fyn, thus
attenuating melanoma cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo, suggesting
that amodiaquine is a promising inhibitor for melanoma treatment.

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete high levels of transforming growth
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) that contributes to the development of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TGF-β1 modulates the expression of L1 cell adhesion
molecule (L1CAM), but its role in tumour progression still remains controversial.
To clarify L1 function in PDAC and cellular phenotypes, we performed L1CAM cell
sorting, silencing and overexpression in several primary pancreatic cancer cells.
PSCs silenced for TGF-β1 were used for crosstalk experiments. We found that
TGF-β1 secreted by PSCs negatively regulates L1CAM expression, through canonical 
TGF-β-Smad2/3 signalling, leading to a more aggressive PDAC phenotype. Cells with
reduced expression of L1CAM harboured enhanced stemness potential and
tumourigenicity. Inactivation of TGF-β1 signalling in PSCs strongly reduced the
aggressiveness of PDAC cells. Our data provide functional proof and mechanistic
insights for the tumour-suppressive function of L1CAM via reducing stemness.
Rescuing L1CAM expression in cancer cells through targeting of TGF-β1 reverses
stemness and bears the potential to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC
patients.

It has been well established that the von Hippel-Lindau/hypoxia-inducible factor 
α (VHL-HIFα) axis and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway
play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC). However, few studies have addressed the relationship between the two
oncogenic drivers in RCC. SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a
histone methyltransferase involved in gene transcription and oncogenesis, but its
expression and function in RCC remain unclear. In the present study, we found
that SMYD3 expression was significantly elevated in RCC tumors and correlated
with advanced tumor stage, histological and nuclear grade, and shorter survival. 
Depletion of SMYD3 inhibited RCC cell proliferation, colony numbers, and
xenograft tumor formation, while promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, SMYD3
cooperates with SP1 to transcriptionally promote EGFR expression, amplifying its 
downstream signaling activity. TCGA data analyses revealed a significantly
increased SMYD3 expression in primary RCC tumors carrying the loss-of-function
VHL mutations. We further showed that HIF-2α can directly bind to the SMYD3
promoter and subsequently induced SMYD3 transcription and expression. Taken
together, we identify the VHL/HIF-2α/SMYD3 signaling cascade-mediated EGFR
hyperactivity through which SMYD3 promotes RCC progression. Our study suggests
that SMYD3 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor in RCC.

Hippo signaling functions to limit cellular growth, but the aberrant nuclear
accumulation of its downstream YAP1 leads to carcinogenesis. YAP1/TEAD complex
activates the oncogenic downstream transcription, such as CTGF and c-Myc. How
YAP1 is protected in the cytoplasm from ubiquitin-mediated degradation remains
elusive. In this study, a member of Angiomotin (Motin) family, AMOTL1 (Angiomotin
Like 1), was screened out as the only one to promote YAP1 nuclear accumulation by
several clinical cohorts, which was further confirmed by the cellular functional 
assays. The interaction between YAP1 and AMOTL1 was suggested by
co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. The clinical significance 
of the AMOTL1-YAP1-CTGF axis in gastric cancer (GC) was analyzed by multiple
clinical cohorts. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of targeting the oncogenic
axis was appraised by drug-sensitivity tests and xenograft-formation assays. The 
upregulation of AMOTL1 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of GC,
and knocking down AMOTL1 impairs its oncogenic properties. The cytoplasmic
interaction between AMOTL1 and YAP1 protects each other from ubiquitin-mediated
degradation. AMOTL1 promotes YAP1 translocation into the nuclei to activate the
downstream expression, such as CTGF. Knocking down AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF
enhances the therapeutic efficacies of the first-line anticancer drugs. Taken
together, AMOTL1 plays an oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through
interacting with YAP1 and promoting its nuclear accumulation. A combination of
AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF expression might serve as a surrogate of Hippo activation 
status. The co-activation of the AMOTL1/YAP1-CTGF axis is associated with poor
clinical outcomes of GC patients, and targeting this oncogenic axis may enhance
the chemotherapeutic effects.

In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), response to platinum (PT)-based chemotherapy 
dictates subsequent treatments and predicts patients' prognosis. Alternative
splicing is often deregulated in human cancers and can be altered by
chemotherapy. Whether and how changes in alternative splicing regulation could
impact on the response of EOC to PT-based chemotherapy is still not clarified. We
identified the splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (SFPQ) as a critical
mediator of response to PT in an unbiased functional genomic screening in EOC
cells and, using a large cohort of primary and recurrent EOC samples, we observed
that it is frequently overexpressed in recurrent PT-treated samples and that its 
overexpression correlates with PT resistance. At mechanistic level, we show that,
under PT treatment, SFPQ, in complex with p54nrb, binds and regulates the
activity of the splicing factor SRSF2. SFPQ/p54nrb complex decreases SRSF2
binding to caspase-9 RNA, favoring the expression of its alternative spliced
antiapoptotic form. As a consequence, SFPQ/p54nrb protects cells from PT-induced 
death, eventually contributing to chemoresistance. Overall, our work unveils a
previously unreported SFPQ/p54nrb/SRSF2 pathway that in EOC cells plays a central
role in regulating alternative splicing and PT-induced apoptosis and that could
result in the design of new possible ways of intervention to overcome PT
resistance.

PDZK1 downregulation was reported to independently predict poor prognosis of
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and induce ccRCC development and
progression. However, the underlying mechanism of PDZK1 downregulation remains
unknown. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks are emerging as new players in
gene regulation and are associated with cancer development. ceRNAs regulate other
RNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs. To investigate the role and
mechanism of ceRNAs in PDZK1 downregulation and the development of ccRCC, we
searched databases for miRNAs and lncRNAs that regulate PDZK1 expression in ccRCC
tissues and assessed their effects in ccRCC. We found that miR-15b was expressed 
at higher levels in ccRCC tissues, and its upregulation was clinically associated
with lower PDZK1 level, larger tumor size and shorter survival time of ccRCC
patients. Conversely, a novel lncRNA (lncPENG) was expressed at a lower level in 
ccRCC tissues, and its downregulation was associated with the same effects as
upregulation of miR-15b. Downregulation of miR-15b and upregulation of lncPENG
resulted in a significant increase in PDZK1 level and inhibition of proliferation
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lncPENG directly bound to miR-15b and
effectively functioned as a sponge for miR-15b to modulate the expression of

downregulation and inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting that it may be
clinically valuable as a therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker of ccRCC.

The NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a member of the mammalian
sirtuin family, plays a pivotal role in deacetylating histone and nonhistone
proteins. Recently, it has been reported that SIRT1 is upregulated in various
kinds of tumors and is associated with cell growth and metastasis. However, the
factors and molecular mechanism regulating its cellular levels remain to be
clarified. Here, we reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 interacts with
SIRT1 and mediates its ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of SMURF2 leads 
to SIRT1 upregulation and induces the tumor formation and growth of colorectal
cancer in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show a negative correlation between 
SIRT1 and SMURF2 expression in human colorectal cancer. Thus, we propose a novel 
mechanism of colorectal tumorigenesis via SIRT1 regulation by SMURF2, which could
potentially give rise to a new strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation contributes to the cancer stem cell
(CSC) phenotype through regulating gene expression. YTHDF2, an m6A reader, was
shown to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient prognosis.
However, the effect of YTHDF2 on liver CSC and cancer metastasis and the
molecular mechanism of this effect have not been documented. Here, we show that
YTHDF2 expression is negatively correlated with HCC patient survival in both data
from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and clinical data from our center.
By detecting CD133+ cells and carrying out sphere culture assays, we found that
knockdown of YTHDF2 led to impaired stemness in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. In
contrast, overexpression of YTHDF2 increased the CSC phenotype. Mechanistically, 
the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 in liver cancer cells resulted in
decreased and increased m6A levels in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of OCT4
mRNA, respectively, leading to decreased and increased OCT4 protein expression,
respectively. A luciferase activity assay showed that mutation of the
corresponding m6A methylation sequence in the 5'-UTR of OCT4 mRNA caused
significantly decreased gene expression, suggesting a role for YTHDF2-dependent
m6A methylation in protein translation. Polysome profiling results also indicated
the knockdown and overexpression of YTHDF2 could decrease and increase OCT4
translation, respectively. In particular, overexpression of OCT4 rescued the
impaired stemness caused by YTHDF2 depletion, which confirmed the effect of
YTHDF2 on CSC phenotype is dependent on OCT4. In vivo, the loss of YTHDF2 reduced
tumor burden and inhibited lung metastasis following orthotopic transplantation
in nude mice. Last, we demonstrated that YTHDF2 expression is positively
correlated with OCT4 expression and m6A levels in the 5'-UTR of OCT4 mRNA in
clinical HCC specimens. In conclusion, YTHDF2 promotes the CSC liver phenotype
and cancer metastasis by modulating the m6A methylation of OCT4 mRNA.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis is largely responsible for
HCC-associated recurrence and mortality. We aimed to identify metastasis-related 
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to understand the molecular mechanism of HCC
metastasis. We first identified that miR-1258 was downregulated in HCC tissues
both in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center
(SYSUCC) dataset. MiR-1258 expression negatively correlated with recurrence-free 
survival and overall survival of HCC patients. MiR-1258 overexpression inhibited 
migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas miR-1258
downregulation promoted cell metastasis. Luciferase assays verified direct
binding of miR-1258 to Smad2 and Smad3, thereby attenuating TGF-β/Smad signaling.
We further established that lncRNA LINC01278 was a negative regulator of
miR-1258. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that LINC01278-mediated HCC
metastasis was dependent on miR-1258 expression. Furthermore, miR-1258
downregulation in turn increased LINC01278 expression. We also observed that
TCF-4 could bind to the LINC01278 promoter site. In addition, LINC01278
downregulation decreased migration and invasion of HCC cells induced by β-catenin
and TGF-β1 both in vitro and in vivo. We uncovered a novel mechanism for
β-catenin/TCF-4-LINC01278-miR-1258-Smad2/3 feedback loop activation in HCC
metastasis, and the study indicated that LINC01278 could serve as a therapeutic
target for HCC metastasis.

Klotho is a transmembrane protein, which can be shed and act as a circulating
hormone and is involved in regulating cellular calcium levels and inhibition of
the PI3K/AKT pathway. As a longevity hormone, it protects normal cells from
oxidative stress, and as a tumor suppressor it inhibits growth of cancer cells.
Mechanisms governing these differential activities have not been addressed.
Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and dysregulation of
mitochondrial activity is a hallmark of aging. We hypothesized that klotho exerts
its differential effects through regulation of these two hallmarks. Treatment
with klotho inhibited glycolysis, reduced mitochondrial activity and membrane
potential only in cancer cells. Accordingly, global metabolic screen revealed
that klotho altered pivotal metabolic pathways, amongst them glycolysis and
tricarboxylic acid cycle in breast cancer cells. Alteration of metabolic activity
and increased AMP/ATP ratio lead to LKB1-dependent AMPK activation. Indeed,
klotho induced AMPK phosphorylation; furthermore, inhibition of LKB1 partially
abolished klotho's tumor suppressor activity. By diminishing deltapsi (Δψ) klotho
also inhibited mitochondria Ca2+ shuttling thereby impairing mitochondria
communication with SOCE leading to reduced Ca2+ influx by SOCE channels. The
reduced SOCE was followed by ER Ca2+ depletion and stress. These data delineate
mechanisms mediating the differential effects of klotho toward cancer versus
normal cells, and indicate klotho as a potent regulator of metabolic activity.

Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, plays vital roles in energy
sensing, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain less clear. Here, we
report that SIRT7 is required for p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest during glucose 
deprivation. We show that SIRT7 directly interacts with p300/CBP-associated
factor (PCAF) and the affinity for this interaction increases during glucose
deprivation. Upon binding, SIRT7 deacetylates PCAF at lysine 720 (K720), which
augments PCAF binding to murine double minute (MDM2), the p53 E3 ubiquitin
ligase, leading to accelerated MDM2 degradation. This effect results in
upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor, p21Waf1/Cip1, which further
leads to cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell viability. These data highlight the
importance of the SIRT7-PCAF interaction in regulating p53 activity and
cell-cycle progression during conditions of glucose deprivation. This axis may
represent a new avenue to design effective therapeutics based on tumor
starvation.

Aberrant expression of laminin-332 promotes tumour growth and metastasis in
multiple cancers. However, the dysregulated expression and mechanism of action of
LAMB3, which encodes the β3 subunit of laminin-332, and the mechanism underlying 
dysregulated LAMB3 expression in CRC remain obscure. Here, we show that LAMB3 is 
overexpressed in CRC and that this overexpression is correlated with tumour
metastasis and poor prognosis. Overexpression of LAMB3 promoted cell
proliferation and cell migration in vitro and tumour growth and metastasis in
vivo, while knockdown of LAMB3 elicited opposing effects. LAMB3 inhibited the
tumour suppressive function of FOXO3/4 by activating AKT in CRC. Both the BET
inhibitor JQ1 and the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased the mRNA level of LAMB3 in
multiple CRC cells. Mechanistically, ELK4 cooperated with BRD2 to regulate the
transcription of LAMB3 in CRC by directly binding to the ETS binding motifs in
the LAMB3 promoter. ELK4 was as acetylated at K125, which enhanced the
interaction between ELK4 and BRD2. JQ1 disrupted the interaction between ELK4 and
BRD2, resulting in decreased binding of BRD2 to the LAMB3 promoter and
downregulation of LAMB3 transcription. Both ELK4 and BRD2 expression was
associated with LAMB3 expression in CRC. LAMB3 expression was also negatively
correlated with FOXO3/4 in CRC. Our study reveals the pro-tumorigenic role of
LAMB3 through the AKT-FOXO3/4 axis and the transcriptional mechanism of LAMB3 in 
CRC, demonstrating that LAMB3 is a potential therapeutic target that can be
targeted by BET inhibitors and MEK inhibitors.

We previously identified that the development of early-stage myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (eMDSCs) in breast cancer with high IL-6 (IL-6high) expression
was correlated with the SOCS3 deficiency-dependent hyperactivation of the
JAK/STAT signaling pathway. However, the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been 
elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the posttranscriptional
regulation mediated by cancer exosome-derived miRNAs affected the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway and the development of eMDSCs. Using miRNA microarray, we
screened miR-9 and miR-181a which were exclusively upregulated in eMDSCs and
inversely associated with SOCS3 expression. We found both miRNAs promoted the
amplification of immature eMDSCs with the strong suppression on T-cell immunity
in mice and humans. Furthermore, miR-9 and miR-181a promoted 4T1 tumor growth and
immune escape via enhancing eMDSCs infiltration in situ. But miR-9 and miR-181a
stimulated eMDSCs development by separately inhibiting SOCS3 and PIAS3, two
crucial regulators in the negative feedback loop of the JAK/STAT signaling
pathway. Elevated miR-9 and miR-181a in eMDSCs was derived from tumor-derived
exosomes, and blocking the exosome release could fully attenuate the
miRNA-mediated regulation on eMDSCs development. In summary, our findings
indicated that tumor exosome-derived miR-9 and miR-181a activated the JAK/STAT
signaling pathway via targeting SOCS3 and PIAS3, respectively, and thus promoted 
the expansion of eMDSCs which might provide potential therapeutic target for
IL-6high breast cancer treatment.

The overexpression of SOX4 in various kinds of cancer cells was associated with
poor prognosis for patients. The role of SOX4 in angiogenesis and tumor
microenvironment modulation was recently documented in breast cancer but remains 
unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our study, the clinical relevance
of SOX4 overexpression in HCC and its role in the tumor microenvironment were
investigated. The overexpression of SOX4 (SOX4high) in tumor lesions was
associated with higher microvessel density (P = 0.012), tumor thrombosis
formation (P = 0.012), distant metastasis (P < 0.001), and an independent
prognostic factor for disease-free survival in HCC patients (P = 0.048).
Endogenous SOX4 knockout in Hep3B cells by the CRISPR/cas9 system reduced the
expression of CXCL12, which, in turn, attenuated chemotaxis in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells, tube formation in vitro, reduced tumor growth, reticular 
fiber production, and angiogenesis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. Treatment 
with an antagonist targeting CXCR4 (AMD3100), a receptor of CXCL12, inhibited
chemotaxis and tube formation in endothelial cells in vitro. The CXCL12 promoter 
was activated by ectopic expression of a Flag-tagged SOX4 plasmid, endogenous
SOX4 knockdown abolished promoter activity of CXCL12 as shown by luciferase
assays, and an association with the CXCL12 promoter was identified via chromatin 
immunoprecipitation in HCC cells. In conclusion, SOX4 modulates the CXCL12
promoter in HCC cells. The secretory CXCL12, in turn, modulates CXCR4 in
endothelial cells, reticular fibers to regulate the tumor microenvironment and
modulate neovascularization, which might contribute to the distant metastasis of 
tumors.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor
outcomes associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Enhancer of 
zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 
(PRC2), which silences transcription through trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 
27 (H3K27me3) and has emerged as an important therapeutic target with inhibitors 
targeting its methyltransferase activity under clinical investigation. Here, we
show that EZH2 has a non-catalytic and PRC2-independent role in stabilizing DDB2 
to promote nucleotide excision repair (NER) and govern cisplatin resistance in
SCLC. Using a synthetic lethality screen, we identified important regulators of
cisplatin resistance in SCLC cells, including EZH2. EZH2 depletion causes
cellular cisplatin and UV hypersensitivity in an epistatic manner with DDB1-DDB2.
EZH2 complexes with DDB1-DDB2 and promotes DDB2 stability by impairing its
ubiquitination independent of methyltransferase activity or PRC2, thereby
facilitating DDB2 localization to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer crosslinks to
govern their repair. Furthermore, targeting EZH2 for depletion with DZNep
strongly sensitizes SCLC cells and tumors to cisplatin. Our findings reveal a
non-catalytic and PRC2-independent function for EZH2 in promoting NER through
DDB2 stabilization, suggesting a rationale for targeting EZH2 beyond its
catalytic activity for overcoming cisplatin resistance in SCLC.

The mechanistic action of histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) in cancer motility,
including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), remains largely undefined. We 
found that the expression of HDAC8 was upregulated in breast cancer (BC) cells
and tissues as compared to the controls. Further, BC tissues had the highest
values of HDAC8 expression among 31 kinds of cancers. Cellular study indicated
that HDAC8 can positively regulate the dissemination and EMT of BC cells. It
increased the protein stability of Snail, an important regulator of EMT, by
phosphorylation of its motif 2 in serine-rich regions. There are 21 factors that 
have been reported to regulate the protein stability of Snail. Among them, HDAC8 
can decrease the expression of GSK-3β through increasing its
Ser9-phosphorylation. Mass spectrum analysis indicated that HDAC8 interact with
AKT1 to decrease its acetylation while increase its phosphorylation, which
further increased Ser9-phosphorylation of GSK-3β. The C-terminal of AKT1 was
responsible for the interaction between HDAC8 and AKT1. Further, Lys426 was the
key residue for HDAC8-regulated deacetylation of AKT1. Moreover, HDAC8/Snail axis
acted as adverse prognosis factors for in vivo progression and overall survival
(OS) rate of BC patients. Collectively, we found that HDAC8 can trigger the
dissemination of BC cells via AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signals, which imposed that
inhibition of HDAC8 is a potential approach for BC treatment.

Guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) is an interferon-inducible large GTPase which 
is crucial to the protective immunity against microorganisms. However, its
biological function in cancer remains largely unknown. Glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) is the most common and deadly brain tumor in adults. Here we show that GBP2
expression is highly elevated in GBM tumor and cell lines, particularly in those 
of the mesenchymal subtype. High GBP2 expression is associated with poor
prognosis. GBP2 overexpression significantly promotes GBM cell migration and
invasion in vitro, and GBP2 silencing by RNA interference exhibits opposite
effects. We further show that fibronectin (FN1) is dramatically induced by GBP2
expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and FN1 is essential for
GBP2-promoted GBM invasiveness. Inhibition of Stat3 pathway prevents
GBP2-promoted FN1 induction and cell invasion. Consistently, GBP2 dramatically
promotes GBM tumor growth and invasion in mice and significantly reduces the
survival time of the mice with tumor. Taken together, these findings establish
the role of GBP2/Stat3/FN1 signaling cascade in GBM invasion and suggest GBP2 may
serve as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion.

Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF) is a transcription factor and
tyrosine kinase. WSTF overexpression promotes migration and proliferation of
various cancers, and Ser158 (WSTFS158) phosphorylation plays an important role in
this process. However, the role of the other posttranslational modifications of
WSTF is unknown. Here, we report that lysine (K) 426 on WSTF is acetylated by MOF
and deacetylated by SIRT1. Mechanistically, male-specific lethal (MSL) 1v1
interaction with WSTF facilitates its interaction with MOF for WSTF acetylation, 
which in turn promotes WSTFS158 phosphorylation. The kinase and transcriptional
regulatory activity of WSTF were enhanced by acetylation. WSTFK426ac levels
positively and significantly correlated with tumor size, histological grade, and 
age. Moreover, we demonstrated that acetylated WSTF promotes cancer cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor formation. In conclusion, we
identified the enzymes regulating WSTF K426 acetylation, and demonstrated an
acetylation-dependent mechanism that modulates the activities of WSTF and
contributes to tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new clues to study
WSTF-mediated normal development and disease.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as two complexes (mTORC1 and
mTORC2), regulating cell growth and metabolism. Aberrant mTOR signaling occurs
frequently in cancers, so mTOR has become an attractive target for cancer
therapy. Iron chelators have emerged as promising anticancer agents. However, the
mechanisms underlying the anticancer action of iron chelation are not fully
understood. Particularly, reports on the effects of iron chelation on mTOR
complexes are inconsistent or controversial. Here, we found that iron chelators
consistently inhibited mTORC1 signaling, which was blocked by pretreatment with
ferrous sulfate. Mechanistically, iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition was
not related to ROS induction, copper chelation, or PP2A activation. Instead,
activation of AMPK pathway mainly and activation of both HIF-1/REDD1 and Bnip3
pathways partially contribute to iron chelation-induced mTORC1 inhibition. Our
findings indicate that iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 via multiple pathways and
iron is essential for mTORC1 activation.

Mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53 are rare in renal cell carcinomas. p53 is 
a key factor for inducing antiangiogenic genes and RCC are highly vascularized,
which suggests that p53 is inactive in these tumors. One regulator of p53 is the 
Mdm2 oncogene, which is correlated with high-grade, metastatic tumors. However,
the sole activity of Mdm2 is not just to regulate p53, but it can also function
independent of p53 to regulate the early stages of metastasis. Here, we report
that the oncoprotein Mdm2 can bind directly to the tumor suppressor VHL, and
conjugate nedd8 to VHL within a region that is important for the p53-VHL
interaction. Nedd8 conjugated VHL is unable to bind to p53 thereby preventing the
induction of antiangiogenic factors. These results highlight a previously unknown
oncogenic function of Mdm2 during the progression of cancer to promote
angiogenesis through the regulation of VHL. Thus, the Mdm2-VHL interaction
represents a pathway that impacts tumor angiogenesis.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cancer development and
progression, and some function in a highly cancer-specific manner. However,
whether the cause of their expression is an outcome of a specific regulatory
mechanism or nonspecific transcription induced by genome reorganization in cancer
remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated a group of lncRNAs that we
previously identified to be aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer (PC), called 
TPCATs. Our high-throughput real-time PCR experiments were integrated with
publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data and revealed that the expression of 
a subset of TPCATs is driven by PC-specific transcription factors (TFs),
especially androgen receptor (AR) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Our in vitro
validations confirmed that AR and ERG regulated a subset of TPCATs, most notably 
for EPCART. Knockout of EPCART was found to reduce migration and proliferation of
the PC cells in vitro. The high expression of EPCART and two other TPCATs
(TPCAT-3-174133 and TPCAT-18-31849) were also associated with the biochemical
recurrence of PC in prostatectomy patients and were independent prognostic
markers. Our findings suggest that the expression of numerous PC-associated
lncRNAs is driven by PC-specific mechanisms and not by random cellular events
that occur during cancer development. Furthermore, we report three prospective
prognostic markers for the early detection of advanced PC and show EPCART to be a
functionally relevant lncRNA in PC.

In response to genotoxic stress, multiple kinase signaling cascades are
activated, many of them directed towards the tumor suppressor p53, which
coordinates the DNA damage response (DDR). Defects in DDR pathways lead to an
accumulation of mutations that can promote tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence
implicates multiple members of the NimA-related kinase (NEK) family (NEK1, NEK10,
and NEK11) in the DDR. Here, we describe a function for NEK10 in the regulation
of p53 transcriptional activity through tyrosine phosphorylation. NEK10 loss
increases cellular proliferation by modulating the p53-dependent transcriptional 
output. NEK10 directly phosphorylates p53 on Y327, revealing NEK10's unexpected
substrate specificity. A p53 mutant at this site (Y327F) acts as a hypomorph,
causing an attenuated p53-mediated transcriptional response. Consistently,
NEK10-deficient cells display heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.
Further, a combinatorial score of NEK10 and TP53-target gene expression is an
independent predictor of a favorable outcome in breast cancers.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck cancer with highly
aggressive and metastatic potential in which distant metastasis is the main
reason for treatment failure. Till present, the underlying molecular mechanisms
of NPC metastasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identified S100
calcium-binding protein A14 (S100A14) as a functional regulator suppressing NPC
metastasis by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway and reversing the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). S100A14 was found to be downregulated in
highly metastatic NPC cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of 202 NPC 
samples revealed that lower S100A14 expression was significantly correlated with 
shorter patient overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival
(DMFS). S100A14 was also found as an independent prognostic factor for favorable 
survival. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirmed that S100A14 suppressed
the in vitro and in vivo motility of NPC cells. Mechanistically, S100A14 promoted
the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of interleukin-1
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to suppress NPC cellular migration.
Moreover, S100A14 and IRAK1 established a feedback loop that could be disrupted
by the IRAK1 inhibitor T2457. Overall, our findings showed that the S100A14-IRAK1
feedback loop could be a promising therapeutic target for NPC metastasis.

Increasing evidence supports that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as master
regulators involved in tumorigenesis and development at the N6-methyladenine
(m6A) epigenetic modification level. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism
in breast cancer (BRCA) remains elusive. Here, we unveil that LINC00942 (LNC942) 
exerts its functions as an oncogene in promoting METTL14-mediated m6A methylation
and regulating the expression and stability of its target genes CXCR4 and CYP1B1 
in BRCA initiation and progression. Specifically, LNC942 and METTL14 were
significantly upregulated accompanied with the upregulation of m6A levels in BRCA
cells and our included BRCA cohorts (n = 150). Functionally, LNC942 elicits
potent oncogenic effects on promoting cell proliferation and colony formation and
inhibiting cell apoptosis, subsequently elevating METTL14-mediated m6A
methylation levels and its associated mRNA stability and protein expression of
CXCR4 and CYP1B1 in BRCA cells. Mechanistically, LNC942 directly recruits METTL14
protein by harboring the specific recognize sequence (+176-+265), thereby
stabilized the expression of downstream targets of LNC942 including CXCR4 and
CYP1B1 through posttranscriptional m6A methylation modification in vitro and in
vivo. Therefore, our results uncover a novel LNC942-METTL14-CXCR4/CYP1B1
signaling axis, which provides new targets and crosstalk m6A epigenetic
modification mechanism for BRCA prevention and treatment.

Cancer stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and resistance to
chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to understand the molecular regulators of
stemness in the quest to develop effective cancer therapies. TAZ is a
transcription activator that promotes stem cell functions in post-development
mammalian cells; suppression of TAZ activity reduces or eliminates cancer
stemness in select cancers. Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) is
the unique enzyme of the last step of posttranslational prenylation processing
pathway that modifies several oncogenic proteins, including RAS. We found that
suppression of ICMT results in reduced self-renewal/stemness in KRAS-driven
pancreatic and breast cancer cells. Silencing of ICMT led to significant
reduction of TAZ protein levels and loss of self-renewal ability, which could be 
reversed by overexpressing mutant KRAS, demonstrating the functional impact of
ICMT modification on the ability of KRAS to control TAZ stability and function.
Contrary to expectation, YAP protein levels appear to be much less susceptible
than TAZ to the regulation by ICMT and KRAS, and YAP is less consequential in
regulating stemness characteristics in these cells. Further, we found that the
ICMT-dependent KRAS regulation of TAZ was mediated through RAF, but not PI3K,
signaling. Functionally, we demonstrate that a signaling cascade from ICMT
modification of KRAS to TAZ protein stability supports cancer cell self-renewal
abilities in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In addition, studies using the
proof-of-concept small molecule inhibitors of ICMT confirmed its role in
regulating TAZ and self-renewal, demonstrating the potential utility of targeting
ICMT to control aggressive KRAS-driven cancers.

SDCBP is an adapter protein containing two tandem PDZ domains mediating cell
adhesion. The role and underlying molecular mechanism of SDCBP in ESCC remain
obscure. Here, we report that SDCBP is frequently overexpressed in ESCC tissues
and cells compared to normal controls and that its overexpression is correlated
with late clinical stage and predicts poor prognosis in ESCC patients.
Functionally, high expression of SDCBP is positively related to ESCC progression 
both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, mechanistic studies show that SDCBP
activates the EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by binding to EGFR and preventing
EGFR internalization. Moreover, we provide evidence that AURKA binds to SDCBP and
phosphorylates it at the Ser131 and Thr200 sites to inhibit
ubiquitination-mediated SDCBP degradation. More importantly, the sites at which
AURKA phosphorylates SDCBP are crucial for the EGFR signaling-mediated oncogenic 
function of SDCBP. Taken together, we propose that SDCBP phosphorylation by AURKA
prevents SDCBP degradation and promotes ESCC tumor growth through the
EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings unveil a new AURKA-SDCBP-EGFR axis 
that is involved in ESCC progression and provide a promising therapeutic target
for ESCC treatment in the clinic.

Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is a member of the arm-repeat (armadillo) and plakophilin
gene families and it is an essential component of the desmosomes. Although
desmosomes have generally been associated with tumor suppressor functions, we
have consistently observed that PKP1 is among the top overexpressed proteins in
squamous cell lung cancer. To explore this paradox, we developed in vivo and in
vitro functional models of PKP1 gain/loss in squamous cell lung cancer.
CRISPR-Cas9 PKP1 knockout severely impaired cell proliferation, but it increased 
cell dissemination. In addition, PKP1 overexpression increased cell
proliferation, cell survival, and in vivo xenograft engraftment. We further
investigated the molecular mechanism of the mainly oncogenic function of PKP1 by 
combining transcriptomics, proteomics, and protein-nucleic acid interaction
assays. Interestingly, we found that PKP1 enhances MYC translation in
collaboration with the translation initiation complex by binding to the 5'-UTR of
MYC mRNA. We propose PKP1 as an oncogene in SqCLC and a novel posttranscriptional
regulator of MYC. PKP1 may be a valuable diagnostic biomarker and potential
therapeutic target for SqCLC. Importantly, PKP1 inhibition may indirectly target 
MYC, a primary anticancer target.

RNA-binding proteins play key roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA
during cancer progression. Here, we show that RNA-binding motif protein 43
(RBM43) is significantly downregulated in human tumors, and its low expression is
correlated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Overexpression of RBM43
suppressed cell proliferation in culture and resulted in the growth arrest of
tumor xenografts, whereas downregulating RBM43 played an opposite role. We have
also demonstrated that overexpression or knockdown of RBM43 affects the
cell-cycle progression of liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, RBM43 directly
associated with the 3'UTR of Cyclin B1 mRNA and regulated its expression.
Moreover, loss of Rbm43 in mice promoted liver carcinogenesis and HCC development
after diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. Taken
together, our data indicate that RBM43 is a tumor suppressor that controls the
cell cycle through modulation of Cyclin B1 expression, providing evidence that
RBM43 is particularly important in HCC.

NORE1A (RASSF5) is a tumor suppressor of the Ras-association domain family
(RASSF) that is commonly inactivated in multiple human cancers. However, the
molecular mechanism underlying its growth inhibition function remains largely
undefined. Here we report that NORE1A antagonizes tumor necrosis factor receptor 
I (TNFRI) through the assembly of ITCH-mediated destruction complex to suppress
TNF-NF-κB signaling and tumorigenesis. Moreover, NORE1A is identified as a
transcription target of NF-κB, which directs an apoptotic switch of TNF effect by
blocking ITCH interaction with and ubiquitination of BAX. Mechanistically, NORE1A
binds directly to TNFRI and ITCH via the C1 and PPXY domains, respectively to
facilitate the formation of ITCH-mediated destruction complex followed by
ubiquitination-mediated lysosomal degradation of TNFRI. Through this function,
NORE1A suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory
and tumor-promoting genes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasion and
migration of tumor cells, and also debilitates tumor cell activation of
macrophage and fibroblast. While NORE1A suppresses TNF receptor-mediated
apoptosis, it activates TNF-induced apoptosis through BAX activation by
protecting BAX from ITCH binding and ubiquitination. Cytotoxic response to TNF is
substantially attenuated in NORE1A-depleted cells and tumors, and NORE1A-induced 
tumor regression is highly impeded in BAX-depleted tumors. An inverse correlation
is shown between NORE1A and TNFRI expression in both cancer cell lines and
primary tumors, and NORE1A effect on survival of cancer patients is strongly
associated with expression status of ITCH. Collectively, this study uncovers that
NORE1A directs a substrate switch of ITCH favoring TNFRI over BAX to terminate
TNF signaling and accelerate apoptosis, illuminating the mechanistic consequence 
of NORE1A inactivation in tumorigenesis.

LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is a metastasis-related protein reported to enhance
tumour progression in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism 
is still elusive. As the major biological and pathological functions of LASP1 are
accomplished by its LIM and SH3 domains via protein-protein interactions, a yeast
two-hybrid system was employed to screen novel LASP1-interacting proteins.
N-WASP, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, was
screened and identified as a LASP1-interacting protein overexpressed in CRC
tissues. N-WASP could stimulate the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro 
and increase the formation of subcutaneous tumours, mesenteric implanted tumours 
and hepatic metastatic tumours. N-WASP could interact with and activate the
Arp2/3 complex to stimulate actin polymerization, thus changing the migratory and
invasive capabilities of CRC cells. The interaction of LASP1 with N-WASP did not 
influence the expression of N-WASP but recovered the reduced actin polymerization
induced by N-WASP silencing. High N-WASP expression was detected in most clinical
colorectal samples, and it was positively correlated with the expression of LASP1
and ARP3, as well as the tumour budding and pattern of invasion, but negatively
correlated with host lymphocytic response. Our study suggests a new mechanism for
LASP1-mediated CRC metastasis determined by exploring LASP1-interacting proteins 
and identifies N-WASP as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

Cumulative evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) promote gene expression in
cancers. However, the pathophysiologic relevance of miRNA-mediated RNA activation
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be established. Our previous miRNA
expression profiling in seven-paired HCC specimens revealed miR-93-5p as an
HCC-related miRNA. In this study, miR-93-5p expression was assessed in HCC
tissues and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR and fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The correlation of miR-93-5p expression with survival and
clinicopathological features of HCC was determined by statistical analysis. The
function and potential mechanism of miR-93-5p in HCC were further investigated by
a series of gain- or loss-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo. We
identified that miR-93-5p, overexpressed in HCC specimens and cell lines, leads
to poor outcomes in HCC cases and promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion
in HCC cell lines. Mechanistically, rather than decreasing target mRNA levels as 
expected, miR-93-5p binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) to directly upregulate 
its expression and downstream p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway,
thereby leading to cell cycle progression in HCC. Notably, we also demonstrated
that c-Jun, a downstream effector of the JNK pathway, enhances miR-93-5p
transcription by targeting its promoter region. Besides, downregulation of
miR-93-5p significantly retarded tumor growth, while overexpression of miR-93-5p 
accelerated tumor growth in the HCC xenograft mouse model. Altogether, we
revealed a miR-93-5p/MAP3K2/c-Jun positive feedback loop to promote HCC
progression in vivo and in vitro, representing an RNA-activating role of
miR-93-5p in HCC development.

Chemoresistance is a major obstacle to prolonging pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient survival. TET1 is identified as the most important 
epigenetic modification enzyme that facilitates chemoresistance in cancers.
However, the chemoresistance mechanism of TET1 in PDAC is unknown. This study
aimed to determine the role of TET1 in the chemoresistance of PDAC.
TET1-associated chemoresistance in PDAC was investigated in vitro and in vivo.
The clinical significance of TET1 was analyzed in 228 PDAC patients by tissue
microarray profiling. We identified that TET1 downregulation is caused by its
promoter hypermethylation and correlates with poor survival in PDAC patients. In 
vitro and in vivo functional studies performed by silencing or overexpressing
TET1 suggested that TET1 is able to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and sensitize PDAC cells to 5FU and gemcitabine. Then RNA-seq, whole genome
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and ChIP-seq were used to explore the TET1-associated
pathway, and showed that TET1 promotes the transcription of CHL1 by binding and
demethylating the CHL1 promoter, which consequently inhibits the Hedgehog
pathway. Additionally, inhibiting Hedgehog signaling by CHL1 overexpression or
the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, GDC-0449, reversed the chemoresistance induced by
TET1 silencing. Regarding clinical significance, we found that high TET1 and high
CHL1 expression predicted a better prognosis in resectable PDAC patients. In
summary, we demonstrated that TET1 reverses chemoresistance in PDAC by
downregulating the CHL1-associated Hedgehog signaling pathway. PDAC patients with
a high expression levels of TET1 and CHL1 have a better prognosis.

Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common and highly invasive form of
cancer. SCC arises due to ultraviolet light exposure and is associated with
increased expression of pro-cancer genes and reduced expression of cancer
suppressors. Actin-Like Protein 6A (ACTL6A, BAF53a) is an important protein
subunit of the SWI/SNF epigenetic chromatin regulatory complex. ACTL6A is
elevated in cancer cells and has been implicated as a driver of cancer cell
proliferation and tumor growth. In the present study, we show that ACTL6A drives 
SCC cell proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and that
these activities are markedly reduced by ACTL6A knockdown. We further show that
ACTL6A expression is associated with reduced levels of the p21Cip1
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor protein. Molecular studies
show that ACTL6A interacts with p53 DNA response elements in the p21Cip1 gene
promoter to suppress p21Cip1 promoter activity and mRNA and protein level.
Additional studies show that an increase in p21Cip1 expression in ACTL6A
knockdown cells is required for suppression of the SCC cell phenotype, suggesting
that p21Cip1 is a mediator of ACTL6A action. We further show that this regulation
is p53 independent. These findings suggest that ACTL6A suppresses p21Cip1
promoter activity to reduce p21Cip1 protein as a mechanism to maintain the
aggressive epidermal SCC phenotype.

PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activity is highly elevated in glioblastoma
(GBM). Although rapamycin is known to inhibit this pathway, GBM patients are

is correlated with poor prognosis. Smurf1 promotes cell growth and colony
formation by accelerating cell cycle and aberrant signaling pathways. In
addition, we show that Smurf1 ubiquitylates and degrades PTEN. We further
demonstrate that the oncogenic role of Smurf1 is dependent on PTEN. Upregulated
Smurf1 impairs PTEN activity, leading to consistent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway; and depletion of Smurf1 dramatically inhibits cell
proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover, loss of Smurf1 abolishes the aberrant
regulation of PTEN, causing negative feedback on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway,
and thus leading to rescue of tumor sensitivity to rapamycin in an orthotopic GBM
model. Taken together, we show that Smurf1 promotes tumor progression via PTEN,
and combined treatment of Smurf1 knockdown with mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibition reduces tumor progression. These results identify a unique role
of Smurf1 in mTOR inhibitor resistance and provide a strong rationale for
combined therapy targeting GBM.

Oligodendroglioma is an important type of lower-grade glioma (LGG), which is a
slowly progressing brain tumor. Many LGGs eventually transform into a more
aggressive or malignant type. Enhanced angiogenesis is a characteristic of
malignantly transformed oligodendroglioma (m-oligodendroglioma). However, the
pathogenesis and signaling pathways associated with angiogenesis and
proliferation in m-oligodendroglioma are not well understood. In this study, we
identified that Insulin Gene Enhancer Protein (ISL2) and its angiogenic capacity 
were inversely related to survival according to LGG patient data from an online
database, and this was further confirmed with pathological LGG patient samples,
including malignantly transformed samples, by detecting the expression of ISL2,
the angiogenic markers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) and CD31 and
the proliferation marker Ki-67. We then established novel oligodendroglioma
patient tumor-derived orthotopic xenograft mouse models and cell lines to verify 
the role of ISL2 in regulating angiogenesis to promote oligodendroglioma growth
and malignant transformation. Furthermore, ISL2 regulated ANGPT2 transcription by
binding to the ANGPT2 promoter. Then, ANGPT2, a downstream gene, activated
angiogenesis through VEGFA to promote oligodendroglioma malignant transformation.
Finally, combining AAV-ISL2-shRNA with temozolomide suppressed oligodendroglioma 
progression more effectively than either monotherapy in vivo and in vitro. Thus, 
hypoxia-induced ISL2 regulated ANGPT2, which subsequently induced angiogenesis to
promote oligodendroglioma growth and malignant transformation. Malignancy was
accompanied by worsened hypoxia inside the tumor mass, creating a positive
feedback loop. In conclusion, this study suggests that ISL2 is a biomarker for
oligodendroglioma progression and that anti-ISL2 therapy may offer a potential
clinical strategy for treating m-oligodendroglioma.

Aurora B kinase plays essential roles in mitosis. Its protein levels increase
before the onset of mitosis and sharply decrease during mitosis exit. The latter 
decrease is due to a balance between the actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (activated by the Cdh1 adapter), and the 
deubiquitinating enzyme USP35. Aurora B also executes important functions in
interphase. Abnormal modulation of Aurora B in interphase leads to cell cycle
defects often linked to aberrant chromosomal condensation and segregation. Very
little is however known about how Aurora B levels are regulated in interphase.
Here we found that USP13-associates with and stabilizes Aurora B in cells,
especially before their entry into mitosis. In order for USP13 to exert its
stabilizing effect on Aurora B, their association is promoted by the Aurora
B-mediated phosphorylation of USP13 at Serine 114. We also present evidence that 
USP13 instigates Aurora B deubiquitination and/or protect it from degradation in 
a non-catalytic manner. In addition, we report that genetic or chemical
modulation of the cellular levels/activity of USP13 affects unperturbed
cell-cycle progression. Overall our study unveils the molecular and cellular
connections of the USP13-Aurora B axis, which potentially participates in the
rewiring of the cell cycle happening in cancer cells.

Metastatic breast cancer is characterized by high mortality and limited
therapeutic target. During tumor metastasis, cytoskeletal reorganization is one
of the key steps in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Collapsin 
response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that plays an
important role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Previous researches have
reported that altered CRMP2 expression is associated with breast cancer
progression, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we
show that CRMP2 expression is reduced in various subtypes of breast cancers and
negatively correlated with lymphatic metastasis. Overexpression of CRMP2
significantly inhibits invasion and stemness in breast cancer cells, while
downregulation of CRMP2 promotes cell invasion, which is not required for tubulin
polymerization. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that CRMP2 interacts with RECK,
prevents RECK degradation, which, in turn, blocks NF-κB and Wnt signaling
pathways. Furthermore, we find that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at T514 and S522
remarkably abolishes its functions to bind with RECK and to inhibit cell
invasion. Pharmacologic rescue of CRMP2 expression suppressed breast cancer
metastasis in vitro and in vivo and stimulated a synergetic effect with FN-1501
that induces CRMP2 dephosphorylation. Collectively, this study highlights the
potential of CRMP2 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer metastasis and
reveals a distinct mechanism of CRMP2.

The mechanistic basis of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer remains poorly
understood. We previously reported that the sclerostin domain containing-1
(SOSTDC1) protein is overexpressed in the secretome of metastatic colorectal
cancer cells and can inhibit liver homing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms
of SOSTDC1 for promoting invasiveness and progression of colorectal cancer liver 
metastasis. SOSTDC1 inhibition of BMP4 maintains the expression of cancer stem
cell traits, including SOX2 and NANOG. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry 
analyses reveal the association of SOSTDC1 with ALCAM/CD166, which was confirmed 
by confocal microscopy and competition ELISA. Interaction with ALCAM is mediated 
by the N-terminal region of SOSTDC1, which contains a sequence similar to the
ALCAM-binding motif used by CD6. Knocking down either SOSTDC1 or ALCAM
expression, or using blocking antibodies, reduces the invasive activity by
inhibiting Src and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, ALCAM interacts with
the α2ß1 and α1ß1 integrins, providing a possible link to Src activation.
Finally, inoculation of SOSTDC1-silenced metastatic cells increases mouse
survival by inhibiting liver metastasis. In conclusion, SOSTDC1 promotes invasion
and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, by overcoming BMP4-specific
antimetastatic signals and inducing ALCAM-mediated Src and PI3K/AKT activation.
These experiments underscore the potential of SOSTDC1 as a therapeutic target in 
metastatic colorectal cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major cause of cancer-associated death 
worldwide, but its underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play an important role in the aberrant
regulation of gene expression in many cancers, including NSCLC. Here, we
investigated the involvement of the lncRNA KTN1-AS1 in NSCLC. We found that
KTN1-AS1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissue and was positively associated
with poor prognosis. KTN1-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell growth and proliferation, 
increased apoptosis, and modulated the expression of cell cycle- and
apoptosis-related proteins (cyclin A1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, Bcl2, and Bax) 
in NSCLC cell lines and tumour xenografts in nude mice. KTN1-AS1 bound to and
directly regulated the expression of miR-130a-5p. Notably, miR-130a-5p
overexpression suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in
vitro and in vivo, and this effect was reversed by KTN1-AS1 overexpression.
Finally, we showed that KTN1-AS1 modulated the expression of
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), a miR-130a-5p target and
key regulator of autophagy in NSCLC cells. Taken together, our results suggest
that the KTN1-AS1/miR-130a-5p/PDPK1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target
for NSCLC.

Glioma reported to be refractory to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is the most
common malignant tumor in central nervous system. Our research showed the low
expression of miR-450a-5p and high expression of EGFR in glioma tissues.
MiR-450a-5p was also observed to synergize with gefitinib to inhibit the
proliferation, migration and invasion and induce the apoptosis and autophagy of
glioma cells. Furthermore, miR-450a-5p was demonstrated to target 3'UTR of EGFR, 
and regulated EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, the above
effects induced by miR-450a-5p in glioma cells were reversed by WIPI1 silencing. 
The inhibition role of miR-450a-5p on glioma growth was also confirmed in vivo by
subcutaneous and intracranial tumor xenografts. Therefore, we conclude that
miR-450a-5p synergizes with gefitinib to inhibit the glioma tumorigenesis through
inducing autophagy by regulating the EGFR-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway, thereby enhancing the drug sensitivity of gefitinib.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers without druggable molecular
targets. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcriptional
factor that promotes malignancy in various cancers including pancreatic cancer.
Herein, we found that HIF-1 is accumulated in normoxic or moderate hypoxic areas 
of pancreatic cancer xenografts in vivo and is active even during normoxia in
pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. This prompted us to analyze whether the HIF-1
activator Mint3 contributes to malignant features of pancreatic cancer. Mint3
depletion by shRNAs attenuated HIF-1 activity during normoxia and cell
proliferation concomitantly with accumulated p21 and p27 protein in pancreatic
cancer cells. Further analyses revealed that Mint3 increased transcription of the
oncogenic ubiquitin ligase SKP2 in pancreatic cancer cells via HIF-1. This
Mint3-HIF-1-SKP2 axis also promoted partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
stemness features, and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Even in vivo, 
Mint3 depletion attenuated tumor growth of orthotopically inoculated human
pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells. Database and tissue microarray analyses showed
that Mint3 expression is correlated with SKP2 expression in human pancreatic
cancer specimens and high Mint3 expression is correlated with poor prognosis of
pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, targeting Mint3 may be useful for attenuating
the malignant features of pancreatic cancer.

In patients with lung cancer, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been 
reported to be significantly increased. Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) from
various cancers played a critical role in MDSC induction. However, studies on the
molecular mechanism underlying MDSC expansion induced by exosomes from lung
cancer cells are still limited. In this study, we demonstrated that LLC-Exo
accelerated tumor growth along with a significant accumulation of MDSCs in mouse 
tumor model. miRNA profiling showed that miR-21a was enriched in LLC-Exo. The
depletion of miR-21a in LLC-Exo leads to the loss of their ability to induce MDSC
expansion. Further results showed that miR-21a of LLC-Exo induced MDSC expansion 
via downregulation of the programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) protein. The
results of gain-and loss-of-function experiments validated that PDCD4 function as
a critical inhibitor to negatively regulate expansion of MDSCs via inhibition
Il-6 production in bone marrow cells. In addition, our data showed that exosomes 
derived from human lung cancer cell lines expressing miR-21a, also induced
expansion of MDSCs in human CD14+ monocytes in vitro. Overall, our results
demonstrated that miR-21a enriched in lung carcinoma cell-derived exosomes could 
promote functional expansion of MDSCs through targeting PDCD4.

DNA methylation is implicated in the acquisition of malignant phenotypes, and the
use of epigenetic modulating drugs is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic
strategy. 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (decitabine, 5-azadC) is an FDA-approved DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor with proven effectiveness against
hematological malignancies and more recently triple-negative breast cancer (BC). 
Herein, genetic or pharmacological studies uncovered a hitherto unknown
feedforward molecular link between DNMT1 and the estrogen related receptor α
(ERRα), a key transcriptional regulator of cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, 
DNMT1 promotes ERRα stability which in turn couples DNMT1 transcription with that
of the methionine cycle and S-adenosylmethionine synthesis to drive DNA
methylation. In vitro and in vivo investigation using a pre-clinical mouse model 
of BC demonstrated a clear therapeutic advantage for combined administration of
the ERRα inhibitor C29 with 5-azadC. A large-scale bisulfite genomic sequencing
analysis revealed specific methylation perturbations fostering the discovery that
reversal of promoter hypermethylation and consequently derepression of the tumor 
suppressor gene, IRF4, is a factor underlying the observed BC suppressive
effects. This work thus uncovers a critical role of ERRα in the crosstalk between
transcriptional control of metabolism and epigenetics and illustrates the
potential for targeting ERRα in combination with DNMT inhibitors for BC treatment
and other epigenetics-driven malignancies.

Emerging evidence indicates that myeloma overexpressed (MYEOV) is an oncogene and
plays crucial roles in multiple human cancers. However, its roles in the
development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain elusive. Here, we
provide evidence of essential roles of MYEOV in the development and progression
of PDAC. In tumor specimens derived from pancreatic cancer patients, MYEOV was
overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. In addition, MYEOV expression
in PDAC was upregulated through promoter hypomethylation. MYEOV depletion
impaired metastatic ability and proliferation of PDAC cells both in vitro and in 
vivo, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effect. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that MYEOV interacted with SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9
(SOX9), a well-known oncogenic transcription factor in PDAC. This interaction
occurred mainly in the nuclei of PDAC cells and increased transcriptional
activity of SOX9. Furthermore, MYEOV promoted the expression of Hairy and
enhancer of split homolog-1 (HES1), a SOX9 target gene, by enhancing SOX9
DNA-binding ability to the HES1 enhancer without affecting the protein level and 
subcellular localization of SOX9. HES1 knockdown partly abrogated the oncogenic
effect of MYEOV. Our findings suggest that MYEOV could be a potential prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.

Current reports refer to the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate
androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) as a tumor suppressor in some types of
cancer but as an oncogene in other kinds of cancer. In gastric cancer, it had
been reported to be downregulated. However, the clinical significance and
underlying mechanism of PART1 function in gastric cancer remains undefined. Here,
seven differential expression levels of noncoding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were screened
from gastric cancer through a probe reannotation of a human exon array. PART1 was
selected for further study because of its high fold change number. In our cohort,
PART1 was identified as a significant downregulated lncRNA in gastric cancer
tissues by qPCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), and its low expression was
significantly correlated with postoperative metastasis and short overall survival
time after surgery. Through the results of gain-of-function experiments, PART1
was confirmed as a tumor suppressor that can decrease not only cell viability,
migration, and invasion in vitro but also tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis in
vivo. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation 
(RIP) showed that PART1 interacts with androgen receptor (AR), and then,
promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is upregulated in an
androgen-independent manner. In a chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay additionally illustrated that PLZF upregulation increased the
enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27 trimethylation in the platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGFB) promotor, thereby inhibition of PDGFB and the subsequent PDGFRβ/PI3K/Akt 
signaling pathway. Based on these findings, we showed PART1 plays a tumor
suppressor role by promoting PLZF expression followed by recruitment of EZH2 to
mediate epigenetic PDGFB silencing and downstream PI3K/Akt inhibition, suggesting
that PART1 has a key role in restraining the aggressive ability of GC cells and
providing a novel perspective on lncRNAs in GC progression.

Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and metastatic
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, cellular communication
between heterogeneous HCC cells with different metastatic potentials and the
resultant cancer progression are not fully understood in HCC. Here, HCC cells
with high-metastatic capacity (97hm and Huhm) were constructed by continually
exerting selective pressure on primary HCC cells (MHCC-97H and Huh7). Through
performing exosomal miRNA sequencing in HCC cells with different metastatic
potentials (MHCC-97H and 97hm), many significantly different miRNA candidates
were found. Among these miRNAs, miR-92a-3p was the most abundant miRNA in the
exosomes of highly metastatic HCC cells. Exosomal miR92a-3p was also found
enriched in the plasma of HCC patient-derived xenograft mice (PDX) model with
high-metastatic potential. Exosomal miR-92a-3p promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in recipient cancer cells via targeting PTEN and regulating its 
downstream Akt/Snail signaling. Furthermore, through mRNA sequencing in HCC cells
with different metastatic potentials and predicting potential transcription
factors of miR92a-3p, upregulated transcript factors E2F1 and c-Myc were found in
high-metastatic HCC cells promote the expression of cellular and exosomal
miR-92a-3p in HCC by directly binding the promoter of its host gene, miR17HG.
Clinical data showed that a high plasma exosomal miR92a-3p level was correlated
with shortened overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating poor
prognosis in HCC patients. In conclusion, hepatoma-derived exosomal miR92a-3p
plays a critical role in the EMT progression and promoting metastasis by
inhibiting PTEN and activating Akt/Snail signaling. Exosomal miR92a-3p is a
potential predictive biomarker for HCC metastasis, and this may provoke the
development of novel therapeutic and preventing strategies against metastasis of 
HCC.

Lymph node metastasis is the major adverse feature for recurrence and death of
thyroid cancer patients. To identify lncRNAs involved in thyroid cancer
metastasis, we systemically screened differentially expressed lncRNAs in lymph
node metastasis, thyroid cancer, and normal tissues via RNAseq. We found that
lncRNA SLC26A4-AS1 was continuously, significantly down-regulated in normal
tissues, thyroid cancer, and lymph node metastasis specimens. Low SLC26A4-AS1
levels in tissues were significantly associated with poor prognosis of thyroid
cancer patients. LncRNA SLC26A4-AS1 markedly inhibited migration, invasion, and
metastasis capability of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly,
SLC26A4-AS1 could simultaneously interact with DDX5 and the E3 ligase TRIM25,
which promoting DDX5 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In
particular, SLC26A4-AS1 inhibited expression of multiple DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) repair genes, especially genes coding proteins in the MRE11/RAS50/NBS1
(MRN) complex. Enhanced interaction between DDX5 and transcriptional factor E2F1 
due to silencing of SLC26A4-AS1 promoted binding of the DDX5-E2F1 complex at
promoters of the MRN genes and, thus, stimulate the MRN/ATM dependent DSB
signaling and thyroid cancer metastasis. Our study uncovered new insights into
the biology driving thyroid cancer metastasis and highlights potentials of
lncRNAs as future therapeutic targets again cancer metastasis.

Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation is a well-recognized phenotypic change of
prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and it ultimately
develops into an aggressive subset of this disease. However, the contribution of 
signaling pathways that lead to metabolic disorders and NE differentiation of
prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we identified that ADT induced
upregulation of the succinate-CoA ligase GDP-forming beta subunit (SUCLG2), which
regulates succinate metabolism and NE differentiation of prostate cancer. We
demonstrated a connection that upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling induced SUCLG2
expression in prostate cancer cells. The LIFR is upregulated by nuclear EGFR,
which acts as a transcriptional regulator, directly binds to the LIFR promoter,
and drives NE differentiation and glycolysis of prostate cancer. LIFR
upregulation is associated with SUCLG2, which increased succinate synthesis and
enzymatic activities of mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) in
prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of SUCLG2 suppressed NE differentiation in
cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth in a xenograft model. Analysis
of prostate tissue samples showed increased intensity of nuclear EGFR associated 
with the LIFR and SUCLG2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer tumors. Our
study provides a mechanism whereby ADT upregulates EGFR-LIFR signaling that
activates SUCLG2, which subsequently stimulates the metabolic changes associated 
with NE differentiation and aggressive prostate cancer phenotype.

ERα positive breast cancer accounts for 70% of breast malignancies. Compared with
ERα negative types, ERα positive breast cancer could be effective controlled by
endocrine therapy. However, more than half of the patients will develop endocrine
resistance, making it an important clinical issue for breast cancer therapy.
Endocrine resistance might be caused by multiple alternations, including the
components of ERα signaling, during tumor progression. Thus, it is urgent and
necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms that controls ERα expression and
stability to improve breast cancer therapeutics. In our current study, we
identifies that the ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ERα and facilitates breast
cancer progression. The expression of RNF181 is correlated with ERα level in
human breast tumors and relates to poor survival in endocrine-treated patients.
RNF181 depletion inhibits breast cancer progression in vivo and in vitro, reduces
ERα protein level and its target gene expression, such as PS2 and GREB1. Unbiased
RNA sequencing analysis indicates RNF181 is necessary for ERα signature gene
expression in whole genomic level. Immuno-precipitation assays indicate that
RNF181 associates with ERα and promotes its stability possibly via inducing ERα
K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. In conclusion, our data implicate a non-genomic
mechanism by RNF181 via stabilizing ERα protein controls ERα target gene
expression linked to breast cancer progression.

Snail is a master inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
metastasis, however, Snail protein is labile and is quickly degraded through the 
predominate ubiquitination-mediated proteasome pathway. Deubiquitinases (DUBs)
can counteract the Snail degradation process to maintain high level of Snail
protein in cancer cells. In this study, we screened a cDNA library containing 79 
DUBs, and discovered that a panel of DUBs consisting of USP13, USP28, USP29,
USP37, OTUD6A, and DUB3 can markedly stabilize Snail protein, with USP29
displaying the strongest activity to prevent Snail degradation. Mechanistically, 
USP29 enhances the interaction of Snail and SCP1, resulting in simultaneous
dephosphorylation and deubiquitination of Snail and thereafter cooperative
prevention of Snail degradation. Biologically, ectopic expression of USP29
promotes gastric cancer cell migration, and depletion of Snail abolishes
USP29-mediated cell migration; and USP29 can be induced by major EMT and
metastatic inducing factors such as TGFβ, TNFα, and hypoxia. More importantly,
high expression levels of Snail, USP29, and SCP1 are associated with poor
survival and prognosis. Collectively, these data indicate that Snail is a crucial
substrate for USP29 to promote cell migration and USP29/SCP1 complex may be new
therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancer.

Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Altered 
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are playing regulatory roles in physiological and
pathogenic processes in cancer. Here, we uncovered a differentially expressed
lncRNA called brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1), and elucidated its function and
molecular mechanism in the progression and development of glioma. Three fresh
tumor tissues from glioma patients and three normal brain tissues from
craniocerebral trauma patients were prepared for high-throughput RNA sequencing. 
Differential RNA transcripts and BCYRN1 were identified by RT-qPCR in glioma
samples and controls. CCK-8, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, TUNEL
assays, cell migration assays, wound-healing assays, and xenograft model were
established to investigate the biological function of BCYRN1 both in vitro and in
vivo. Various bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays,
biotinylated RNA pulldown assays, and rescue experiments were conducted to reveal
the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). 183 lncRNAs
were identified with significant dysregulation in glioma and randomly selected
differential RNAs were further confirmed by RT-qPCR. Among them, BCYRN1 was the
most downregulated lncRNA, and its low expression positively correlated with
glioma progression. Functionally, BCYRN1 overexpression inhibited cell
proliferation, migration in glioma cell lines, whereas BCYRN1 depletion resulted 
in the opposite way. MiR-619-5p was further confirmed as the direct target of
BCYRN1. Mechanistically, miR-619-5p specifically targeted the CUE domain
containing protein 2 (CUEDC2), and BCYRN1/miR-619-5p suppressed glioma
tumorigenesis by inactivating PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway in a CUEDC2-dependent manner. 
Overall, our data presented that the reduced expression of BCYRN1 was associated 
with poor patient outcome in glioma. BCYRN1 functioned as a ceRNA to inhibit
glioma progression by sponging miR-619-5p to regulate CUEDC2 expression and
PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway. Our results indicated that BCYRN1 exerted tumor suppressor 
potential and might be a candidate in the diagnosis and treatment of glioma.

Epigenetic alteration is one of the hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many
driver genes are regulated by DNA methylation in CRC. However, the role of DNA
methylation regulating lncRNAs remain elusive. Here, we identify that SNHG11
(small nucleolar RNA host gene 11) is upregulated by promotor hypomethylation in 
CRC and is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. SNHG11 can promote CRC
cell migration and metastasis under hypoxia. Interestingly, the DNA-binding motif
of SNHG11 is similar to that of HIF-1α. In addition, SNHG11-associated genes are 
enriched with members of the HIF-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Mechanistically,
SNHG11 binds to the pVHLrecognition sites on HIF-1α, thus blocking the
interaction of pVHL with HIF-1α and preventing its ubiquitination and
degradation. Moreover, SNHG11 upregulates the expression of HIF-1α target genes, 
i.e., AK4, ENO1, HK2, and Twist1. Notably, SNHG11 can bind to the HRE sites in
the promoter of these genes and increase their transcription. In summary, these
results identify a SNHG11/ HIF-1α axis that plays a pivotal role in tumor
invasion and metastasis.

While mechanisms for metastasis were extensively studied in cancer cells from
patients with detectable tumors, pathways underlying metastatic dissemination
from early lesions before primary tumors appear are poorly understood. Her2
promotes breast cancer early dissemination by suppressing p38, but how Her2
downregulates p38 is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in early lesion breast
cancer models, Her2 inhibits p38 by inducing Skp2 through Akt-mediated
phosphorylation, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of
Tpl2, a p38 MAP3K. The early disseminating cells are
Her2+Skp2highTpl2lowp-p38lowE-cadherinlow in the MMTV-Her2 breast cancer model.
In human breast carcinoma, high Skp2 and low Tpl2 expression are associated with 
the Her2+ status; Tpl2 expression positively correlates with that of activated
p38; Skp2 expression negatively correlates with that of Tpl2 and activated p38.
Moreover, the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 axis plays a key role in the disseminating
phenotypes in early lesion breast cancer cells; inhibition of Tpl2 enhances early
dissemination in vivo. These findings identify the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 cascade
as a novel mechanism mediating breast cancer early dissemination and a potential 
target for novel therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination.

Metastasis is responsible for the death of most breast cancer patients. Robo1 has
been implicated as a tumor suppressor for various cancers including breast
cancer. However, it is not well understood how Robo1 expression is regulated
during tumorigenesis. In this study, we uncovered that the transmembrane proline 
rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4 (PRRG4) promotes breast cancer metastasis
by downregulating Robo1. Analysis of mRNA expression data in The Cancer Genome
Atlas and immunohistochemistry assay on breast tumor samples showed that PRRG4
expression was higher in breast tumors than in normal breast tissues. Experiments
with PRRG4 knockdown and overexpression revealed that PRRG4 promoted migration
and invasion of breast cancer cells, and enhanced metastasis in an experimental
metastasis model. Mechanistically, we found that PRRG4 via its LPSY and PPPY
motifs recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, which induced ubiquitination and 
degradation of Robo1, thus contributing to migration and invasion of breast
cancer cells. In addition, PRRG4 interacted with and enhanced protein tyrosine
kinase Src and FAK activation. Overall, our data support a model that PRRG4 via
NEDD4 downregulates the Robo1, resulting in the activation of Src and FAK and
promoting breast cancer metastasis. PRRG4 may be a novel target for treating
metastatic breast cancer.

Metastasis is the main reason for high mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, it is
important to elucidate the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis. Here, we report a
novel role of SIX homeobox 4 (SIX4), one of the SIX gene family, in promoting HCC
metastasis. The elevated expression of SIX4 was positively correlated with loss
of tumor encapsulation, microvascular invasion, higher TNM stage, and poor
prognosis in human HCC. SIX4 expression was an independent and significant risk
factor for the recurrence and survival in HCC patients. Upregulation of SIX4
promoted HCC invasion and metastasis, whereas downregulation of SIX4 decreased
HCC invasion and metastasis. SIX4 transactivated Yes1 associated transcriptional 
regulator (YAP1) and MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET)
expression through directly binding to their promoters. Knockdown of YAP1 and
c-MET inhibited SIX4-medicated HCC metastasis, while the stable overexpression of
YAP1 and c-MET reversed the decreased metastasis induced by SIX4 knockdown.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the specific ligand of c-MET, upregulated SIX4
expression through ERK/NF-κB pathway. Knockdown of SIX4 significantly decreased
HGF-enhanced HCC metastasis. In human HCC tissues, SIX4 expression was positively
correlated with nuclear YAP1, c-MET and HGF expression. Patients with positive
coexpression of SIX4/ nuclear YAP1, SIX4/c-MET or HGF/SIX4 had the poorest
prognosis. Moreover, the combination treatment of YAP1 inhibitor Verteporfin and 
c-MET inhibitor Capmatinib significantly suppressed SIX4-mediated HCC metastasis.
In conclusion, SIX4 is a prognostic biomarker in HCC patients and targeting the
HGF-SIX4-c-MET positive feedback loop may provide a promising strategy for the
treatment of SIX4-driven HCC metastasis.

Oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) plays a critical role in multiple
carcinogenic signal pathways, and its overexpression has been found in various
types of cancer; however, the pathophysiological role of OSR1 in breast cancer
has not been evaluated. This study aims to elaborate on the role of OSR1 in
breast cancer metastasis and the specific regulatory mechanism. Our results
showed that OSR1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in both human breast cancer
samples and cell lines. Moreover, phosphorylated OSR1 (p-OSR1) was an independent
poor prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer. OSR1 upregulation
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and malignant
mammary epithelial cells with the increasing metastatic capacity. In contrast,
deleting OSR1 in aggressive breast cancer cells inhibited these phenotypes. OSR1 
is the critical activator for transcription factors of EMT. Mechanistically, we
found that OSR1 can directly interact and phosphorylate the linker region of
Smad2 at Thr220 and Smad3 at Thr179. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 translocated into the
nucleus to enhance transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) autocrine signalling
and increase the transcription of EMT regulators. Importantly, interruption of
the OSR1-Smad2/3-TGF-β1 signalling axis elicited a robust anti-EMT and
anti-metastatic effect in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that
OSR1-mediated Smad2/3-TGF-β1 signalling promotes EMT and metastasis representing 
a promising therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor
syndrome, characterized by tumor development in multiple organs, including renal 
angiomyolipoma. Biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 is a known genetic driver of
angiomyolipoma development, however, whether an altered transcriptional
repertoire contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis is unknown. RNA-seq
analyses showed that MITF A isoform (MITF-A) was consistently highly expressed in
angiomyolipoma, immunohistochemistry showed microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor nuclear localization, and Chromatin immuno-Precipitation
Sequencing analysis showed that the MITF-A transcriptional start site was highly 
enriched with H3K27ac marks. Using the angiomyolipoma cell line 621-101, MITF
knockout (MITF.KO) and MITF-A overexpressing (MITF.OE) cell lines were generated.
MITF.KO cells showed markedly reduced growth and invasion in vitro, and were
unable to form xenografted tumors. In contrast, MITF.OE cells grew faster in
vitro and as xenografted tumors compared to control cells. RNA-Seq analysis
showed that both ID2 and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) expression
levels were increased in the MITF.OE cells and reduced in the MITF.KO cells, and 
luciferase assays showed this was due to transcriptional effects. Importantly,
CYR61 overexpression rescued MITF.KO cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in
vivo. These findings suggest that MITF-A is a transcriptional oncogenic driver of
angiomyolipoma tumor development, acting through regulation of CYR61.

microRNAs (miRNAs) can be delivered to tumor cells where they exert their
function via mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes. This study
investigated exosomal transfer of miR-139-5p to bladder cancer cells and their
role in the regulation of tumorigenesis. The dysregulation of polycomb repressor 
complex 1 (PRC1) in bladder cancer was characterized by RNA quantification, and
its functional significance in bladder cancer cells was identified by
loss-of-function experiments. We predicted the miR-139-5p that could play a role 
in regulating PRC1, which was further verified using dual-luciferase reporter
gene assay. Next, we altered the expression of miR-139-5p and PRC1 in bladder
cancer cells to identify their functions in cancer progression. Bladder cancer
cells were co-cultured with exosomes isolated from human umbilical cord
mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) over-expressing miR-139-5p. The intercellular
transfer of miR-139-5p along with in vitro and in vivo functions was determined
using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Our results revealed that PRC1
levels were increased in bladder cancer tissues and cells, and silencing PRC1
appeared to impede the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion potentials. In
addition, miR-139-5p was observed to be down-regulated in bladder cancer, which
targeted PRC1 and reduced its expression, hereby resulting in ameliorated
tumorigenic characteristics of bladder cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we
noted that miR-139-5p from hUCMSCs-derived exosomes could be transferred into
bladder cancer cells to down-regulate the PRC1 expression. Moreover,
hUCMSCs-derived exosomal miR-139-5p conferred a suppressive role on bladder
cancer development in vitro and in vivo. These data together supported the
tumor-inhibiting role of MSCs-derived exosomal miR-139-5p in bladder cancer,
highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers in humans. While it thrives in
a state of malnutrition, the mechanism by which pancreatic cancer cells adapt to 
metabolic stress through metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here, we showed
that UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was significantly upregulated in pancreatic
cancer patient samples compared to the levels in adjacent normal tissues. Levels 
of UBR5 were closely related to a malignant phenotype and shorter survival among 
pancreatic cancer patients. Multivariate analyses also revealed that UBR5
overexpression was an independent predictor of poor outcomes among patients with 
pancreatic cancer. Functional assays revealed that UBR5 contributes to the growth
of pancreatic cancer cells by inducing aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that UBR5 knockdown increased levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 
(FBP1), an important negative regulator in the process of aerobic glycolysis in
many cancers. We found a significant negative correlation between levels of UBR5 
and FBP1, further demonstrating that UBR5-induced aerobic glycolysis is dependent
on FBP1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, UBR5 regulates FBP1
expression by modulating C/EBPα, directly binding to C/EBPα, and promoting its
ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these results identify a mechanism used
by pancreatic cancer cells to survive the nutrient-poor tumour microenvironment
and also provide insight regarding the role of UBR5 in pancreatic cancer cell
adaptation to metabolic stresses.

Long noncoding RNAs have been identified as key regulators in the progression of 
various cancers. LINC00261 has been reported as a tumor suppressor in multiple
cancers. However, its function and underlying mechanisms in pancreatic cancer
remain largely unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect RNA
expression. In situ hybridization was used to discover the subcellular location. 
The direct binding of LINC00261 to miR-222-3p was verified using a
dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. LINC00261-binding
proteins were detected using an RNA pulldown assay. LINC00261 was downregulated
in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. Its reduced expression was
correlated with advanced pathological stage and poor prognosis. Forced expression
of LINC00261 suppressed pancreatic cancer glycolysis and proliferation and
induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, downregulation of
LINC00261 was caused by hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region
and EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Moreover, LINC00261
exerted its biological function by binding to miR-222-3p to activate the
HIPK2/ERK/c-myc pathway. In addition, LINC00261 could also reduce c-myc
expression by sequestering IGF2BP1. Our study suggests that LINC00261 functions
as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and identifies novel epigenetic and
posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of LINC00261, which contribute to the
targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer.

Overexpression of D-type cyclins in human cancer frequently occurs as a result of
protein stabilization, emphasizing the importance of identification of the
machinery that regulates their ubiqutin-dependent degradation. Cyclin D3 is
overexpressed in ~50% of Burkitt's lymphoma correlating with a mutation of
Thr-283. However, the E3 ligase that regulates phosphorylated cyclin D3 and
whether a stabilized, phosphorylation deficient mutant of cyclin D3, has
oncogenic activity are undefined. We describe the identification of SCF-Fbxl8 as 
the E3 ligase for Thr-283 phosphorylated cyclin D3. SCF-Fbxl8 poly-ubiquitylates 
p-Thr-283 cyclin D3 targeting it to the proteasome. Functional investigation
demonstrates that Fbxl8 antagonizes cell cycle progression, hematopoietic cell
proliferation, and oncogene-induced transformation through degradation of cyclin 
D3, which is abolished by expression of cyclin D3T283A, a non-phosphorylatable
mutant. Clinically, the expression of cyclin D3 is inversely correlated with the 
expression of Fbxl8 in lymphomas from human patients implicating Fbxl8 functions 
as a tumor suppressor.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified breast cancers are
treated using targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors, but resistance to these 
therapies leads to systemic tumor recurrence of metastatic disease. Herein, we
conducted gene expression analyses of HER2 kinase inhibitor-resistant cell lines 
as compared to their drug-sensitive counterparts. These data demonstrate the
induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which included enhanced
expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and axonal guidance
molecules known as neuropilins (NRPs). Immunoprecipitation of FGFR1 coupled with 
mass spectroscopy indicated that FGFR1 forms a physical complex with NRPs, which 
is enhanced upon induction of EMT. Confocal imaging revealed that FGFR1 and NRP1 
predominantly interact throughout the cytoplasm. Along these lines, short hairpin
RNA-mediated depletion of NRP1, but not the use of NRP1-blocking antibodies,
inhibited FGFR signaling and reduced tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our 
results further indicate that NRP1 upregulation during EMT is mediated via
binding of the chromatin reader protein, bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) in the
NRP1 proximal promoter region. Pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 decreased NRP1 
expression and ablated FGF-mediated tumor cell growth. Overall, our studies
indicate that NRPs facilitate aberrant growth factor signaling during
EMT-associated drug resistance and metastasis. Pharmacological combination of
epigenetic modulators with FGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors may provide improved
outcomes for breast cancer patients with drug-resistant metastatic disease.

PARK7 is involved in many key cellular processes, including cell proliferation,
transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, oxidative stress
protection, and mitochondrial function maintenance. Deregulation of PARK7 has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. 
Here, we aimed to clarify the effect of PARK7 on stemness and radioresistance of 
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Serum differentiation and magnetic cell sorting
of GSCs revealed that PARK7 was preferentially expressed in GSCs rather than
differentiated GSCs. Immunohistochemical staining showed enhanced expression of
PARK7 in glioma tissues compared to that in normal brain tissues. shRNA-mediated 
knockdown of PARK7 inhibited the self-renewal activity of GSCs in vitro, as
evidenced by the results of neurosphere formation, limiting dilution, and
soft-agar clonogenic assays. In addition, PARK7 knockdown suppressed GSC invasion
and enhanced GSC sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). PARK7 knockdown
suppressed expression of GSC signatures including nestin, epidermal growth factor
receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), SOX2, NOTCH1, and OCT4. Contrarily,
overexpression of PARK7 in CD133- non-GSCs increased self-renewal activities,
migration, and IR resistance, and rescued the reduction of GSC factors under
shPARK7-transfected and serum-differentiation conditions. Intriguingly, PARK7
acted as a co-chaperone of HSP90 by binding to it, protecting EGFRvIII from
proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of PARK7 increased the production of reactive 
oxygen species, inducing partial apoptosis and enhancing IR sensitivity in GSCs. 
Finally, PARK7 knockdown increased mouse survival and IR sensitivity in vivo.
Based on these data, we propose that PARK7 plays a pivotal role in the
maintenance of stemness and therapeutic resistance in GSCs.

Cadherins form a large and pleiotropic superfamily of membranous proteins sharing
Ca2+-binding repeats. While the importance of classic cadherins such as E- or
N-cadherin for tumorigenesis is acknowledged, there is much less information
about other cadherins that are merely considered as tissue-specific adhesion
molecules. Here, we focused on the atypical cadherin MUCDHL that stood out for
its unusual features and unique function in the gut. Analyses of transcriptomic
data sets (n > 250) established that MUCDHL mRNA levels are down-regulated in
colorectal tumors. Importantly, the decrease of MUCDHL expression is more
pronounced in the worst-prognosis subset of tumors and is associated with
decreased survival. Molecular characterization of the tumors indicated a negative
correlation with proliferation-related processes (e.g., nucleic acid metabolism, 
DNA replication). Functional genomic studies showed that the loss of MUCDHL
enhanced tumor incidence and burden in intestinal tumor-prone mice. Extensive
structure/function analyses revealed that the mode of action of MUCDHL goes
beyond membrane sequestration of ß-catenin and targets through its extracellular 
domain key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, AKT). Beyond MUCDHL, this
study illustrates how the loss of a gene critical for the morphological and
functional features of mature cells contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating
oncogenic pathways.

A subset of human prostate cancer exhibits increased de novo synthesis of fatty
acids, but the molecular driver(s) of this metabolic abnormality remains obscure.
This study demonstrates a novel metabolic function of c-Myc (Myc) in regulation
of fatty acid synthesis. The role of Myc in regulation of fatty acid synthesis
was investigated by: (a) interrogation of the prostate cancer The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) dataset, (b) chromatin immunoprecipitation, and (c) determination of
the expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and targeted metabolomics using a 
mouse model and human specimens. The expression of MYC was positively associated 
with that of key fatty acid synthesis genes including ACLY, ACC1, and FASN in
prostate cancer TCGA dataset. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed Myc
occupancy at the promoters of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN. Prostate-specific
overexpression of Myc in Hi-Myc transgenic mice resulted in overexpression of
ACLY, ACC1, and FASN proteins in neoplastic lesions and increased circulating
levels of total free fatty acids. Targeted metabolomics confirmed increased
circulating levels of individual fatty acids in the plasma of Hi-Myc mice and
human subjects when compared to corresponding controls. Immunohistochemistry also
revealed a positive and statistically significant association in expression of
Myc with that of ACC1 in human prostate adenocarcinoma specimens. We propose that
Myc-regulated fatty acid synthesis is a valid target for therapy and/or
prevention of prostate cancer.

The key component in the UFM1 conjugation system, UFM1-binding and PCI
domain-containing protein 1 (UFBP1), regulates many biological processes.
Recently it has been shown that low UFBP1 protein level is associated with the
worse outcome of gastric cancer patients. However, how it responses to the
sensitivity of gastric cancer to chemotherapy drugs and the underlying molecular 
mechanism remain elusive. Here, we discovered that high UFBP1 expression
increases the progression-free survival of advanced gastric cancer patients
treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Cell-line based studies unveiled that
UFBP1 expression enhances while UFBP1 knockdown attenuates the sensitivity of
gastric cancer cells to cisplatin. High-throughput SILAC-based quantitative
proteomic analysis revealed that the protein level of aldo-keto reductase 1Cs
(AKR1Cs) is significantly downregulated by UFBP1. Flow cytometry analysis showed 
that UFBP1 expression increases while UFBP1 knockdown reduces reactive oxygen
species upon cisplatin treatment. We further disclosed that UFBP1 attenuates the 
gene expression of AKR1Cs and the transcription activity of the master oxidative 
stress-response transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related
factor 2). Detailed mechanistic studies manifested that UFBP1 promotes the
formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on Nrf2 and thus augments its
proteasome-mediated degradation. Experiments using genetic depletion and
pharmacological activation in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that UFBP1 enhances 
the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin through the Nrf2/AKR1C axis.
Overall, this work discovered a novel prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer
patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and elucidated the underlying
molecular mechanism, which may benefit to future personalized chemotherapy.

Despite significant progression in the study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
the role of the proteasome in regulating cross talk between mTOR signaling and
glycolysis in liver cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we
demonstrate that deficiency of REGγ, a proteasome activator, in mice
significantly attenuates DEN-induced liver tumor formation. Ablation of REGγ
increases the stability of PP2Ac (protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit) in
vitro and in vivo, which dephosphorylates PRAS40 (AKT1 substrate 1) and
stabilizes the interaction between PRAS40 and Raptor to inactive mTORC1-mediated 
hyper-glycolytic metabolism. In the DEN-induced animal model and clinical
hepato-carcinoma samples, high levels of REGγ in HCC tumor regions contribute to 
reduced expression of PP2Ac, leading to accumulation of phosphorylated PRAS40 and
mTORC1-mediated activation of HIF1α. Interestingly, mTORC1 enhances REGγ activity
in HCC, forming a positive feedback regulatory loop. In conclusion, our study
identifies REGγ-PP2Ac-PRAS40 axis as a new layer in regulating mTORC1 activity
and downstream glycolytic alterations during HCC development, highlighting the
REGγ-proteasome as a potential target for personalized HCC therapy.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a type of highly aggressive pediatric tumor in bones and
soft tissues and its metastatic spread remains the most powerful predictor of
poor outcome. We previously identified that the transcription factor
hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) promotes ES tumorigenesis. However, the
mechanisms underlying ES metastasis remain unclear. Here, we show that HDGF
drives ES metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and HDGF reduces metastasis-free
survival (MFS) in two independent large cohorts of human ES patients. Integrative
analyses of HDGF ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling in ES cells reveal that
HDGF regulates multiple metastasis-associated genes, among which activated
leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) emerges as a major HDGF target and a
novel metastasis-suppressor in ES. HDGF down-regulates ALCAM, induces expression 
and activation of the downstream effectors Rho-GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42, and
promotes actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell-matrix adhesion. In addition,
repression of ALCAM and activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for the
pro-metastatic functions of HDGF in vitro. Moreover, analyses in murine models
with ES tumor orthotopic implantation and experimental metastasis, as well as in 
human ES samples, demonstrate the associations among HDGF, ALCAM, and GTPases
expression levels. Furthermore, high HDGF/low ALCAM expression define a subgroup 
of patients harboring the worst MFS. These findings suggest that the
HDGF/ALCAM/GTPases axis represents a promising therapeutic target for limiting ES
metastasis.

Metastasis remains the major obstacle to improved survival for breast cancer
patients. Downregulation of FOXO3a transcription factor in breast cancer is
causally associated with the development of metastasis through poorly understood 
mechanisms. Here, we report that FOXO3a is functionally related to the inhibition
of VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and to the consequent suppression of breast cancer
metastasis. We show that FOXO3a directly induces miR-29b-2 and miR-338
expression. Ectopic expression of miR-29b-2/miR-338 significantly suppresses EMT,
migration/invasion, and in vivo metastasis of breast cancer. Moreover, we
demonstrate that miR-29b-2 directly targets VEGF-A while miR-338 directly targets
NRP1, and show that regulation of miR-29b-2 and miR-338 mediates the ability of
FOXO3a to suppress VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and breast cancer metastasis.
Clinically, our results show that the FOXO3a-miR-29b-2/miR-338-VEGF-A/NRP1 axis
is dysregulated and plays a critical role in disease progression in breast
cancer. Collectively, our findings propose that FOXO3a functions as a metastasis 
suppressor, and define a novel signaling axis of FOXO3a-miRNA-VEGF-A/NRP1 in
breast cancer, which might be potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

Trastuzumab resistance has been becoming a major obstacle for treatment of
HER-2-positive breast cancer patients. Increasing evidence suggests that
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play critical roles during the formation of drug
resistance, however, the underlying mechanism is not well known. In this study,
mass spectrometry, RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed
to verify the direct interactions among AGAP2-AS1 and other associated targets,
such as human antigen R (HuR), miR-15a-5p, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 
(CPT1). In vitro and in vivo experimental assays were done to clarify the
functional role of AGAP2-AS1 in trastuzumab resistance, stemness, and fatty acid 
oxidation (FAO). The results showed that MSC co-culture induced trastuzumab
resistance. AGAP2-AS1 was upregulated in MSC-cultured cells, and knockdown of
AGAP2-AS1 reversed the MSC-mediated trastuzumab resistance. Furthermore, MSC
culture-induced AGAP2-AS1 regulates stemness and trastuzumab resistance via
activating FAO. Mechanistically, AGAP2-AS1 is associated with HuR, and the
AGAP2-AS1-HuR complex could directly bind to the CPT1, increasing its expression 
via improving RNA stability. In addition, AGAP2-AS1 could serve as ceRNA via
sponging miR-15a-5p and releasing CPT1 mRNA. Clinically, increased expression of 
serum AGAP2-AS1 predicts poor response to trastuzumab treatment in breast cancer 
patients. In conclusion, MSC culture-induced AGAP2-AS1 caused stemness and
trastuzumab resistance via promoting CPT1 expression and inducing FAO. Our
results provide new insight of the role of MSCs in trastuzumab resistance and
AGAP2-AS1 could be promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for
HER-2+ breast cancer patients.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly invasive and metastatic skin cancer.
While high expression of miR-375 is a characteristic of MCC, it seems not to
contribute to the malignant phenotype of MCC cells. miR-375 enrichment in
MCC-derived extracellular vesicles suggests its intercellular signaling function.
Here, we demonstrate that horizontally transferred miR-375 causes fibroblast
polarization toward cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The polarization is
evidenced by phenotypic changes and induction of α-SMA, CXCL2, and IL-1β.
Fibroblast polarization is inhibited by specific antagomirs and mimicked by
experimental miR-375 expression. Mechanistically, miR-375 downregulates RBPJ and 
p53, two key players regulating fibroblast polarization. In clinical MCC samples,
in situ hybridization located miR-375 in CAFs, which correlated with high α-SMA
protein and low RBPJ and TP53 expression; single-cell RNAseq revealed a disparate
fibroblast polarization negatively correlating with p53 pathway-related gene
expression. Thus, the functional role of miR-375 in MCC is to generate a
pro-tumorigenic microenvironment by inducing fibroblast polarization.

Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in men. The major cause
of death in prostate cancer patients can be attributed to metastatic spread of
disease or tumor recurrence after initial treatment. Prostate tumors are known to
remain undetected or dormant for a long period of time before they progress
locoregionally or at distant sites as overt tumors. However, the molecular
mechanism of dormancy is yet poorly understood. In this study, we performed a
differential gene expression analysis and identified a gene, Regucalcin (RGN),
which promotes dormancy of prostate cancer. We found that cancer patients
expressing higher level of RGN showed significantly longer recurrence-free and
overall- survival. Using a doxycycline-inducible RGN expression system, we showed
that ectopic expression of RGN in prostate tumor cells induced dormancy in vivo, 
while following suppression of RGN triggered recurrence of tumor growth. On the
other hand, silencing RGN in LNCap cells promoted its outgrowth in the tibia of
mice. Importantly, RGN promoted multiple known hallmarks of tumor dormancy
including activation of p38 MAPK, decrease in Erk signaling and inhibition of
FOXM1 expression. Furthermore, we found that RGN significantly suppressed
angiogenesis by increasing secretory miR-23c level in the exosomes. Intriguingly,
FOXM1 was found to negatively regulate miR-23c expression in prostate cancer. In 
addition, we identified 11 RGN downstream target genes that independently
predicted longer recurrence-free survival in patients. We found that expression
of these genes was regulated by FOXM1 and/or p38 MAPK. These findings suggest a
critical role of RGN in prostate cancer dormancy, and the utility of RGN
signaling and exosomal miR-23c as biomarkers for predicting recurrence.

Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is critically involved in
gastric cancer (GC) progression. However, current Wnt pathway inhibitors being
studied in preclinical or clinical settings for other cancers such as colorectal 
and pancreatic cancers are either too cytotoxic or insufficiently efficacious for
GC. Thus, we screened new potent targets from β-catenin destruction complex
associated with GC progression from clinical samples, and found that scaffolding 
protein RACK1 deficiency plays a significant role in GC progression, but not APC,
AXIN, and GSK3β. Then, we identified its upstream regulator UBE2T which promotes 
GC progression via hyperactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through
the ubiquitination and degradation of RACK1 at the lysine K172, K225, and K257
residues independent of an E3 ligase. Indeed, UBE2T protein level is negatively
associated with prognosis in GC patients, suggesting that UBE2T is a promising
target for GC therapy. Furthermore, we identified a novel UBE2T inhibitor,
M435-1279, and suggested that M435-1279 acts inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
pathway hyperactivation through blocking UBE2T-mediated degradation of RACK1,
resulting in suppression of GC progression with lower cytotoxicity in the
meantime. Overall, we found that increased UBE2T levels promote GC progression
via the ubiquitination of RACK1 and identified a novel potent inhibitor providing
a balance between growth inhibition and cytotoxicity as well, which offer a new
opportunity for the specific GC patients with aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

The mutagenic APOBEC3B (A3B) cytosine deaminase is frequently over-expressed in
cancer and promotes tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance. Hence,
understanding the mechanisms that underlie A3B over-expression is important,
especially for developing therapeutic approaches to reducing A3B levels, and
consequently limiting cancer mutagenesis. We previously demonstrated that A3B is 
repressed by p53 and p53 mutation increases A3B expression. Here, we investigate 
A3B expression upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that activate p53,
including 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and cisplatin. Contrary to expectation, these
drugs induced A3B expression and concomitant cellular cytosine deaminase
activity. A3B induction was p53-independent, as chemotherapy drugs stimulated A3B
expression in p53 mutant cells. These drugs commonly activate ATM, ATR and
DNA-PKcs. Using specific inhibitors and gene knockdowns, we show that activation 
of DNA-PKcs and ATM by chemotherapeutic drugs promotes NF-κB activity, with
consequent recruitment of NF-κB to the A3B gene promoter to drive A3B expression.
Further, we find that A3B knockdown re-sensitises resistant cells to cisplatin,
and A3B knockout enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Our data highlight a
role for A3B in resistance to chemotherapy and indicate that stimulation of A3B
expression by activation of DNA repair and NF-κB pathways could promote cancer
mutations and expedite chemoresistance.

Metastatic melanoma is hallmarked by its ability of phenotype switching to more
slowly proliferating, but highly invasive cells. Here, we tested the impact of
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on melanoma
progression in association with melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF)
expression levels. We established a mouse melanoma model for deleting Stat3 in
melanocytes with specific expression of human hyperactive NRASQ61K in an
Ink4a-deficient background, two frequent driver mutations in human melanoma. Mice
devoid of Stat3 showed early disease onset with higher proliferation in primary
tumors, but displayed significantly diminished lung, brain, and liver metastases.
Whole-genome expression profiling of tumor-derived cells also showed a reduced
invasion phenotype, which was further corroborated by 3D melanoma model analysis.
Notably, loss or knockdown of STAT3 in mouse or human cells resulted in the
upregulation of MITF and induction of cell proliferation. Mechanistically we show
that STAT3-induced CAAT Box Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) expression was
sufficient to suppress MITF transcription. Epigenetic analysis by ATAC-seq
confirmed that CEBPa/b binding to the MITF enhancer region silenced the MITF
locus. Finally, by classification of patient-derived melanoma samples, we show
that STAT3 and MITF act antagonistically and hence contribute differentially to
melanoma progression. We conclude that STAT3 is a driver of the metastatic
process in melanoma and able to antagonize MITF via direct induction of CEBP
family member transcription.

Myeloma cells produce excessive levels of dickkopf-1 (DKK1), which mediates the
inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, leading to multiple myeloma (MM) bone
disease. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying DKK1 overexpression in
myeloma remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide evidence that hypoxia 
promotes DKK1 expression in myeloma cells. Under hypoxic conditions, p38 kinase
phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and drove its
nuclear import to activate DKK1 transcription. In addition, high levels of DKK1
were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions in patients with t(4;14) 
MM, overexpressing the histone methyltransferase MMSET, which was identified as a
downstream target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Furthermore, we
found that CREB could recruit MMSET, leading to the stabilization of HIF-1α
protein and the increased dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 on the DKK1
promoter. Knockdown of CREB in myeloma cells alleviated the suppression of
osteoblastogenesis by myeloma-secreted DKK1 in vitro. Combined treatment with a
CREB inhibitor and the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 (evofosfamide)
significantly reduced MM-induced bone destruction in vivo. Taken together, our
findings reveal that hypoxia and a cytogenetic abnormality regulate DKK1
expression in myeloma cells, and provide an additional rationale for the
development of therapeutic strategies that interrupt DKK1 to cure MM.

Distant metastasis is the leading cause of treatment failure in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been 
fully elucidated. Here, we report that Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (LZTS2) 
is downregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that LZTS2 associates with p85 to inhibit the activation of
PI3K/AKT signaling and impairs HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, we identify LZTS2 as a bona fide substrate of the E3 ligase
β-Trcp and protein kinase CK1δ, which are responsible for the ubiquitination and 
degradation of LZTS2. Importantly, we show that the β-Trcp and CK1δ-mediated
degradation of LZTS2 promotes HCC progression and metastasis by activating
PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, our study not only illustrates the roles of
LZTS2 in regulating HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis but also reveals a novel
posttranslational modification of LZTS2 by β-Trcp and CK1δ, indicating that the
β-Trcp/CK1δ/LZTS2/PI3K axis may be a novel oncogenic driver involved in HCC
progression and metastasis.

Current evidence indicates that resistance to the tyrosine kinase-type cell
surface receptor (HER2)-targeted therapies is frequently associated with HER3 and
active signaling via HER2-HER3 dimers, particularly in the context of breast
cancer. Thus, understanding the response to HER2-HER3 signaling and the
regulation of the dimer is essential to decipher therapy relapse mechanisms.
Here, we investigate a bidirectional relationship between HER2-HER3 signaling and
a type-1 transmembrane sorting receptor, sortilin-related receptor (SorLA;
SORL1). We demonstrate that heregulin-mediated signaling supports SorLA
transcription downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In
addition, we demonstrate that SorLA interacts directly with HER3, forming a
trimeric complex with HER2 and HER3 to attenuate lysosomal degradation of the
dimer in a Ras-related protein Rab4-dependent manner. In line with a role for
SorLA in supporting the stability of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, loss of SorLA
compromised heregulin-induced cell proliferation and sensitized metastatic
anti-HER2 therapy-resistant breast cancer cells to neratinib in cancer spheroids 
in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish brain xenograft model.

Steroid regulated cancer cells use nuclear receptors and associated regulatory
proteins to orchestrate transcriptional networks to drive disease progression. In
primary breast cancer, the coactivator AIB1 promotes estrogen receptor (ER)
transcriptional activity to enhance cell proliferation. The function of the
coactivator in ER+ metastasis however is not established. Here we describe AIB1
as a survival factor, regulator of pro-metastatic transcriptional pathways and a 
promising actionable target. Genomic alterations and functional expression of
AIB1 associated with reduced disease-free survival in patients and enhanced
metastatic capacity in novel CDX and PDX ex-vivo models of ER+ metastatic
disease. Comparative analysis of the AIB1 interactome with complementary RNAseq
characterized AIB1 as a transcriptional repressor. Specifically, we report that
AIB1 interacts with MTA2 to form a repressive complex, inhibiting CDH1 (encoding 
E-cadherin) to promote EMT and drive progression. We further report that
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of AIB1 demonstrates significant
anti-proliferative activity in patient-derived models establishing AIB1 as a
viable strategy to target endocrine resistant metastasis. This work defines a
novel role for AIB1 in the regulation of EMT through transcriptional repression
in advanced cancer cells with a considerable implication for prognosis and
therapeutic interventions.

Perineural invasion (PNI), a pathologic feature defined as cancer cell invasion
in, around, and through nerves, is an indicator of poor prognosis and survival in
prostate cancer (PC). Despite widespread recognition of the clinical significance
of PNI, the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that
monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a clinically and functionally important mediator of
PNI in PC. MAOA promotes PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor innervation in an
orthotopic xenograft model. Mechanistically, MAOA activates SEMA3C in a
Twist1-dependent transcriptional manner, which in turn stimulates cMET to
facilitate PNI via autocrine or paracrine interaction with coactivated PlexinA2
and NRP1. Furthermore, MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively reduces PNI of PC
cells in vitro and tumor-infiltrating nerve fiber density along with suppressed
xenograft tumor growth and progression in mice. Collectively, these findings
characterize the contribution of MAOA to the pathogenesis of PNI and provide a
rationale for using MAOA inhibitors as a targeted treatment for PNI in PC.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or glioblastoma is the most deadly malignant brain 
tumor in adults. GBM is difficult to treat mainly due to the presence of
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
(EGFRvIII) has been linked to stemness and malignancy of GSCs; however, the
regulatory mechanism of EGFRvIII is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that
Anoctamin-1 (ANO1), a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, interacts with EGFRvIII,
increases its protein stability, and supports the maintenance of stemness and
tumor progression in GSCs. Specifically, shRNA-mediated knockdown and
pharmacological inhibition of ANO1 suppressed the self-renewal, invasion
activities, and expression of EGFRvIII and related stem cell factors, including
NOTCH1, nestin, and SOX2 in GSCs. Conversely, ANO1 overexpression enhanced the
above phenomena. Mechanistically, ANO1 protected EGFRvIII from proteasomal
degradation by directly binding to it. ANO1 knockdown significantly increased
survival in mice and strongly suppressed local invasion of GSCs in an in vivo
intracranial mouse model. Collectively, these results suggest that ANO1 plays a
crucial role in the maintenance of stemness and invasiveness of GSCs by
regulating the expression of EGFRvIII and related signaling molecules, and can be
considered a promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.

Aberrant Notch activation has been implicated in multiple malignancies and the
identification of NOTCH receptors and related pathways is critical for targeted
therapy. In this study, we aim to delineate the most prominent dysregulated NOTCH
receptor and comprehensively reveal its deregulation in gastric cancer (GC). In
the four Notch members, NOTCH3 was found uniformly upregulated and associated
with poor clinical outcomes in multiple GC datasets. siRNA-mediated NOTCH3
knockdown demonstrated antitumor effects by suppressing cell proliferation,
inhibiting monolayer formation, and impairing cell invasion abilities. Its
depletion also induced early and late apoptosis. NOTCH3 was confirmed to be a
direct target of two tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-491-5p and
miR-875-5p. The activation of NOTCH3 is partly due to the silence of these two
miRNAs. Through RNA-seq profiling and functional validation, PHLDB2 was
identified as a potent functional downstream modulator for NOTCH3 in gastric
carcinogenesis. PHLDB2 expression demonstrated a positive correlation with
NOTCH3, but was negatively correlated with miR-491-5p. Akt-mTOR was revealed as
the downstream signaling of PHLDB2. The NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt co-activation was found
in 33.7% GC patients and the activation of this axis predicted poor clinical
outcome. GC cells treated with siNOTCH3, siPHLDB2, miR-491-5p, miR-875-5p, were
more sensitive to Cisplatin and 5-FU. Taken together, the NOTCH3-PHLDB2-Akt
cascade plays oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis and serves as a
therapeutic target. Our study provided insights into Notch-mediated underlying
molecular mechanisms and implied translational potential.

KNSTRN is a component of the mitotic spindle, which was rarely investigated in
tumorigenesis. AKT plays an essential role in tumorigenesis by modulating the
phosphorylation of various substrates. The activation of AKT is regulated by PTEN
and PIP3. Here, we prove KNSTRN is positively correlated with malignancy of
bladder cancer and KNSTRN activates AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473.
More importantly, our study reveals that both KNSTRN and PTEN interact with PH
domain of AKT at cell membrane. The amount of KNSTRN interacted with AKT is
negatively related to PTEN. Furthermore, PIP3 pull-down assay proves that KNSTRN 
promoted AKT movement to PIP3. These data suggest KNSTRN may activate AKT
phosphorylation by promoting AKT movement to PIP3 and alleviating PTEN
suppression. Based on the activation of AKT phosphorylation, our study
demonstrates that KNSTRN promotes bladder cancer metastasis and gemcitabine
resistance in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the effect of KNSTRN on tumorigenesis
and gemcitabine resistance could be restored by AKT specific inhibitor MK2206 or 
AKT overexpression. In conclusion, we identify an oncogene KNSTRN that promotes
tumorigenesis and gemcitabine resistance by activating AKT phosphorylation and
may serve as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer.

The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) plays
a key role in cancer progression and is tightly regulated by the proteasome
pathway. E3 ligases that mediate NRF2 ubiquitination have been widely reported,
but the mechanism of NRF2 deubiquitination remains largely unclear. Here, we
identified ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 11 (USP11) in NRF2 complexes
and confirmed an interaction between these two proteins. We further found that
USP11 deubiquitinates NRF2; this modification stabilizes NRF2. Functionally,
USP11 depletion contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and
induction of ferroptotic cell death due to ROS-mediated stress, which can be
largely abrogated by overexpression of NRF2. Finally, immunohistochemical
staining of USP11 and NRF2 was performed using a lung tissue microarray, which
revealed that USP11 is highly expressed in patients with NSCLC and positively
correlated with NRF2 expression. Together, USP11 stabilizes NRF2 and is thus an
important player in cell proliferation and ferroptosis.

Brian metastasis, which is diagnosed in 30% of triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) patients with metastasis, causes poor survival outcomes. Growing evidence 
has characterized miRNAs involving in breast cancer brain metastasis; however,
currently, there is a lack of prognostic plasma-based indicator for brain
metastasis. In this study, high level of miR-211 can act as brain metastatic
prognostic marker in vivo. High miR-211 drives early and specific brain
colonization through enhancing trans-blood-brain barrier (BBB) migration, BBB
adherence, and stemness properties of tumor cells and causes poor survival in
vivo. SOX11 and NGN2 are the downstream targets of miR-211 and negatively
regulate miR-211-mediated TNBC brain metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Most
importantly, high miR-211 is correlated with poor survival and brain metastasis
in TNBC patients. Our findings suggest that miR-211 may be used as an indicator
for TNBC brain metastasis.

Metastasis is the fundamental cause of cancer mortality, but there are still very
few anti-metastatic drugs available. Endosomal trafficking has been implicated in
tumor metastasis, and we have previously found that small chemical vacuolin-1
(V1) potently inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion and general
endosomal-lysosomal degradation. Here, we assessed the anti-metastatic activity
of V1 both in vitro and in vivo. V1 significantly inhibits colony formation,
migration, and invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. It also compromises the
assembly-disassembly dynamics of focal adhesions (FAs) by inhibiting the
recycling and degradation of integrins. In various experimental or transgenic
mouse models, V1 significantly suppresses the metastasis and/or tumor growth of
breast cancer or melanoma. We further identified capping protein Zβ (CapZβ) as a 
V1 binding protein and showed that it is required for the V1-mediated inhibition 
of migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate
that V1 targets CapZβ to inhibit endosomal trafficking and metastasis.

Reversible phosphorylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating
26S proteasome function in health and disease. Over 100 phospho-tyrosine sites of
the human proteasome have been detected, and yet their function and regulation
remain poorly understood. Here we show that the 19S subunit Rpt2 is
phosphorylated at Tyr439, a strictly conserved residue within the C-terminal HbYX
motif of Rpt2 that is essential for 26S proteasome assembly. Unexpectedly, we
found that Y439 phosphorylation depends on Rpt2 membrane localization mediated by
its N-myristoylation. Multiple receptors tyrosine kinases can trigger Rpt2-Y439
phosphorylation by activating Src, a N-myristoylated tyrosine kinase. Src
directly phosphorylates Rpt2-Y439 in vitro and negatively regulates 26S
proteasome activity at cellular membranes, which can be reversed by the
membrane-associated isoform of protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2
(PTPN2). In H1975 lung cancer cells with activated Src, blocking Rpt2-Y439
phosphorylation by the Y439F mutation conferred partial resistance to the Src
inhibitor saracatinib both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model, and
caused significant changes of cellular responses to saracatinib at the proteome
level. Our study has defined a novel mechanism involved in the spatial regulation
of proteasome function and provided new insights into tyrosine kinase
inhibitor-based anticancer therapies.

Smoking is one of the most impactful lifestyle-related risk factors in many
cancer types including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). As the major
component of tobacco and e-cigarettes, nicotine is not only responsible for
addiction to smoking but also a carcinogen. Here we report that nicotine enhances
ESCC cancer malignancy and tumor-initiating capacity by interacting with
cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 7 subunit (CHRNA7) and subsequently
activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. We found that aberrant CHRNA7
expression can serve as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In
multiple ESCC mouse models, dextromethorphan and metformin synergistically
repressed nicotine-enhanced cancer-initiating cells (CIC) properties and
inhibited ESCC progression. Mechanistically, dextromethorphan non-competitively
inhibited nicotine binding to CHRNA7 while metformin downregulated CHRNA7
expression by antagonizing nicotine-induced promoter DNA hypomethylation of
CHRNA7. Since dextromethorphan and metformin are two safe FDA-approved drugs with
minimal undesirable side-effects, the combination of these drugs has a high
potential as either a preventive and/or a therapeutic strategy against
nicotine-promoted ESCC and perhaps other nicotine-sensitive cancer types as well.

Protein ubiquitination is a critical regulator of cellular homeostasis.
Aberrations in the addition or removal of ubiquitin can result in the development
of cancer and key components of the ubiquitination machinery serve as oncogenes
or tumour suppressors. An emerging target in the development of cancer
therapeutics are the deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes that remove ubiquitin from
protein substrates. Whether this class of enzyme plays a role in cervical cancer 
has not been fully explored. By interrogating the cervical cancer data from the
TCGA consortium, we noted that the DUB USP13 is amplified in ~15% of cervical
cancer cases. We confirmed that USP13 expression was increased in cervical cancer
cell lines, cytology samples from patients with cervical disease and in cervical 
cancer tissue. Depletion of USP13 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation.
Mechanistically, USP13 bound to, deubiquitinated and stabilised Mcl-1, a pivotal 
member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Furthermore, reduced Mcl-1 expression 
partially contributed to the observed proliferative defect in USP13 depleted
cells. Importantly, the expression of USP13 and Mcl-1 proteins correlated in
cervical cancer tissue. Finally, we demonstrated that depletion of USP13
expression or inhibition of USP13 enzymatic activity increased the sensitivity of
cervical cancer cells to the BH3 mimetic inhibitor ABT-263. Together, our data
demonstrates that USP13 is a potential oncogene in cervical cancer that functions
to stabilise the pro-survival protein Mcl-1, offering a potential therapeutic
target for these cancers.

Cellular heterogeneity and the lack of metastatic biomarkers limit the diagnosis 
of and development of therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Thus, development of new clinically relevant markers is urgently needed. 
By using RNA-seq analysis, we found that nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) was 
highly expressed in metastatic lung clones of MDA-MB-231 cells. This high level
of NGFR expression was necessary for TNBC cells to grow into tumor spheres under 
nonadhesive conditions, resist anoikis, promote primary tumor growth and increase
metastasis in mice. NGFR was also expressed at a high level in a greater number
of TNBC patients (45%) than non-TNBC patients (23%), enriched in higher grade
tumors, and negatively correlated with the overall survival of TNBC patients.
Mechanistic analysis indicated that NGFR exerted its prometastatic effects by
binding with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (TrkC) mainly through a
ligand-independent manner, which activated the MEK-ERK1-ZEB1 and PI3K-AKT
signaling pathways, increased the level of fibronectin, and decreased the
expression of PUMA. Notably, we observed that NGFR expression in TrkC-positive
metastatic clones reduced cellular sensitivity to anti-Trk therapy. Moreover, WNT
family member 5a (WNT5A) and TrkC activated NGFR transcription in a
ZEB1-dependent manner. Taken together, this study identified NGFR as a novel
driver for transforming TNBC into higher grade metastatic tumors. Our findings
provide the basis for the future development of NGFR as a diagnostic and
prognostic marker for determining the metastatic potential of TNBC and as a
therapeutic target for treating TNBC patients.

Despite the well-established role of CMTM6 in the stabilization of cell surface
PD-L1 in cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying CMTM6 expression and regulation 
are still largely unknown. Here we unexpectedly find a strikingly positive
correlation between CMTM6 and Hu-Antigen R (HuR) expression in most types of
cancer. Mechanistically, we elucidate HuR stabilizes CMTM6 mRNA via direct
association with AU-rich elements (AREs) in its 3'UTR and predominantly
up-regulates CMTM6, which is readily abolished by HuR-specific inhibitor, MS-444.
Phenotypically, we notice abundant cell surface PD-L1 in HuR-high cancer cells,
which significantly inhibits immune activation of co-cultured T cells as
indicated by IL-2 production. Treatment with MS-444 completely relieves immune
suppression imposed by HuR-overexpression and further stimulates immune
responses. Ectopic HuR accelerates allograft tumor progression in vivo, which is 
greatly compromised by simultaneous administration with MS-444. Our study
uncovers a novel mechanism in control of CMTM6 and therefore PD-L1 expression,
and suggests the potential of combining HuR inhibitor with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies 
for cancer immunotherapy.

Type II diabetes (T2D) and specific cancers share many risk factors, however, the
molecular mechanisms underlying these connections are often not well-understood. 
BCDIN3D is an RNA modifying enzyme that methylates specific precursor microRNAs
and tRNAHis. In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to
metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to
uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an
unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer
cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that
BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate
(F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced
glycolytic capacity. We further show that elevated F1,6-BP is due to
downregulation of Aldolase C (ALDOC), an enzyme that cleaves F1,6-BP mainly in
the brain, but whose high expression/amplification is associated with poor
prognosis in breast cancer. BCDIN3D regulates ALDOC through a non-canonical
mechanism involving the crucial let-7 microRNA family and its target site on the 
3'UTR of ALDOC. Overall, our results reveal an important connection between
BCDIN3D, let-7 and glycolysis that may be relevant to breast cancer, obesity, and
T2D.

Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) is linked to the regulation of gene
expression and histone ubiquitylation conformation, which contributes to
carcinogenesis. However, the upstream regulators of PRC1 biogenesis machinery
remain obscure. Here, we report that the polycomb group-related mammalian gene
Mel18 is a target of the protein kinase AKT. AKT phosphorylates Mel18 at T334 to 
disrupt the interaction between Mel18 and other PRC1 members, leading to
attenuated PRC1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H2A at Lys119. As such, PRC1 
target genes, many of which are known oncogenes, are derepressed upon T334-Mel18 
phosphorylation, which promotes malignant behaviours, including cell
proliferation, tumour formation, migration and invasion, bone and brain
metastatic lesion formation. Notably, a positive correlation between AKT activity
and pT334-Mel18 is observed, and prognostic models based on p-AKT and pT334-Mel18
that predicted overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival in breast
cancer patients are established. These findings have implications for
understanding the role of AKT and its associated proteins in chromatin
ubiquitylation, and also indicate the AKT-Mel18-H2AK119ub axis as a novel
prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer patients.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasms. Invasion and
metastasis are the main causes of GC-related deaths. Recently, kinesins were
discovered to be involved in tumor development. The aim of this study was to
elucidate the roles of kinesin superfamily protein 26A (KIF26A) in GC and its
underlying molecular mechanism in regulating tumor invasion and metastasis. Using
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), we showed that KIF26A expression was lower in GC tissues without lymph
node metastasis (LNM) than in nontumorous gastric mucosa, and even lower in GC
tissues with LNM than in GC tissues without LNM. Functional experiments showed
that KIF26A inhibited migration and invasion of GC cells. We further identified
focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit
alpha (PI3KR1), VAV3, Rac1 and p21-activated kinase 2, and β-PAK (PAK3) as
downstream effectors of KIF26A in the focal-adhesion pathway, and we found that
KIF26A could regulate FAK mRNA expression through inhibiting c-MYC by MAPK
pathway. c-MYC could bind to the promoter of FAK and activate FAK transcription. 
Moreover, we found that KIF26A-mediated inactivation of the focal-adhesion
pathway could reduce the occurrence of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) by increasing expression of E-cadherin and reducing that of Snail.
Luciferase assays and Western blotting revealed that miR-19a and miR-96
negatively regulate KIF26A. Finally, we found that decreased expression of KIF26A
has been positively correlated with histological differentiation, Lauren
classification, LNM, distal metastasis, and clinical stage, as well as poor
survival in patients with GC. These data indicate that KIF26A could inhibit GC
migration and invasion by regulating the focal-adhesion pathway and repressing
the occurrence of EMT.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), excessive activation of which has been
considered to be involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we show that tyrosine kinase
c-Src interacts with and phosphorylates G6PD at Tyr 112. This phosphorylation
enhances catalytic activity of G6PD by dramatically decreasing its Km value and
increasing its Kcat value for substrate glucose-6-phosphate. Activated G6PD
therefore augments the PPP flux for NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate production which
is required for detoxification of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
biosynthesis of cancer cells, and eventually contributes to tumorigenesis.
Consistently, c-Src activation is closely correlated with tyrosine
phosphorylation and activity of G6PD in clinical colorectal cancer samples. We
thus uncover another aspect of c-Src in promoting cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis, deepening our understanding of c-Src as a proto-oncogene.

The prognosis for patients with metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) is poor, and it
is not improved by current treatments. RNA-binding motif protein X-linked (RBMX) 
are involved in the regulation of the malignant progression of various tumors.
However, the role of RBMX in BCa tumorigenicity and progression remains unclear. 
In this study, we found that RBMX was significantly downregulated in BCa tissues,
especially in muscle-invasive BCa tissues. RBMX expression was negatively
correlated with tumor stage, histological grade and poor patient prognosis.
Functional assays demonstrated that RBMX inhibited BCa cell proliferation, colony
formation, migration, and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and
metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hnRNP A1 was an
RBMX-binding protein. RBMX competitively inhibited the combination of the RGG
motif in hnRNP A1 and the sequences flanking PKM exon 9, leading to the formation
of lower PKM2 and higher PKM1 levels, which attenuated the tumorigenicity and
progression of BCa. Moreover, RBMX inhibited aerobic glycolysis through hnRNP
A1-dependent PKM alternative splicing and counteracted the PKM2
overexpression-induced aggressive phenotype of the BCa cells. In conclusion, our 
findings indicate that RBMX suppresses BCa tumorigenicity and progression via an 
hnRNP A1-mediated PKM alternative splicing mechanism. RBMX may serve as a novel
prognostic biomarker for clinical intervention in BCa.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the
CCN protein family of secreted proteins with roles in diverse biological
processes. CTGF regulates biological functions such as cell proliferation,
migration, adhesion, wound healing, and angiogenesis. In this study, we
demonstrate a mechanistic link between CTGF and enhanced aerobic glycolysis in
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We found that CTGF is overexpressed in TNBC
and high CTGF expression is correlated with a poor prognosis. Also, CTGF was
required for in vivo tumorigenesis and in vitro proliferation, migration,
invasion, and adhesion of TNBC cells. Our results indicate that extracellular
CTGF binds directly to integrin αvβ3, activating the FAK/Src/NF-κB p65 signaling 
axis, which results in transcriptional upregulation of Glut3. Neutralization of
CTGF decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through downregulation
of Glut3-mediated glycolytic phenotypes. Overall, our work suggests a novel
function for CTGF as a modulator of cancer metabolism, indicating that CTGF is a 
potential therapeutic target in TNBC.

Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is the recommended treatment for local advanced
cervical cancer, but radioresistance remains one of the most important and
unresolved clinical problems. Investigations have revealed aberrant epigenetic
modifications as one of the chief culprits for the development of
radioresistance. Here, we attempt to identify a radiosensitizer from an
epigenetic drug synergy screen and explore the underlying mechanism. We
integrated epigenetic inhibitors and radiotherapy in cervical cancer cell lines
to identify potential radiosensitizers. We further verified the sensitization
effect of the drug and the function of its target gene both in vitro and in vivo.
Finally, we validated the clinical significance of its target gene in clinical
cervical cancer specimens. We identified JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, as a potent
radiosensitizer. Functional assays demonstrated that repressing BRD4 activity led
to significant radiosensitization and potentiation of DNA damage in cervical
cancer cell lines. By using RNA-seq to determine JQ1-mediated changes in
transcription, we identified RAD51AP1 as a major BRD4 target gene involved in
radiosensitivity. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR showed that BRD4
binds to the promoter region of RAD51AP1 and promotes its transcription, whereas 
this activity was attenuated by BRD4 inhibition. The in vivo experiments also
suggested a synergy between BRD4 inhibition and radiotherapy. High BRD4
expression was found to be related to a worse prognosis and radiation resistance.
BRD4 inhibition sensitizes cervical cancer to radiotherapy by inhibiting RAD51AP1
transcription. The combination of JQ1 with radiotherapy merits further evaluation
as a therapeutic strategy for improving local control in cervical cancer.

Metabolic reprogramming is considered hallmarks of cancer. Aerobic glycolysis in 
tumors cells has been well-known for almost a century, but specific factors that 
regulate lactate generation and the effects of lactate in both cancer cells and
stroma are not yet well understood. In the present study using breast cancer cell
lines, human primary cultures of breast tumors, and immune deficient murine
models, we demonstrate that the POU1F1 transcription factor is functionally and
clinically related to both metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer cells and
fibroblasts activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that POU1F1
transcriptionally regulates the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) gene. LDHA
catalyzes pyruvate into lactate instead of leading into the tricarboxylic acid
cycle. Lactate increases breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion. In addition, it activates normal-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) into
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Conversely, LDHA knockdown in breast cancer
cells that overexpress POU1F1 decreases tumor volume and [18F]FDG uptake in tumor
xenografts of mice. Clinically, POU1F1 and LDHA expression correlate with
relapse- and metastasis-free survival. Our data indicate that POU1F1 induces a
metabolic reprogramming through LDHA regulation in human breast tumor cells,
modifying the phenotype of both cancer cells and fibroblasts to promote cancer
progression.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly malignant and has a high mortality with a 5-year
survival rate of less than 8%. As a member of the roundabout immunoglobulin
superfamily of proteins, ROBO1 plays an important role in embryogenesis and
organogenesis and also inhibits metastasis in PC. Our study was designed to
explore whether ROBO1 has effects on the proliferation of PC and its specific
mechanism. The expression of ROBO1 was higher in cancer tissues than in matched
adjacent tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qRT-PCR. Low ROBO1 expression 
is associated with PC progression and poor prognosis. Overexpression of ROBO1 can
inhibit the proliferation of PC cells in vitro, and the S phase fraction can also
be induced. Further subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice showed that ROBO1
overexpression can significantly inhibit tumor growth. YY1 was found to directly 
bind to the promoter region of ROBO1 to promote transcription by a luciferase
reporter gene assay, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Mechanistic studies showed that YY1 
can inhibit the development of PC by directly regulating ROBO1 via the CCNA2/CDK2
axis. Taken together, our results suggest that ROBO1 may be involved in the
development and progression of PC by regulating cell proliferation and shows that
ROBO1 may be a novel and promising therapeutic target for PC.

Osteosarcoma has a poor prognosis, and the poor understanding of the genetic
drivers of osteosarcoma hinders further improvement in therapeutic approaches.
Transcription factor forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) is a crucial modulator in skeletal
development and aging. Here, we determined the role and regulatory mechanisms of 
FOXP1 in osteosarcoma. Higher FOXP1 expression correlated with malignancy in both
osteosarcoma cell lines and clinical biopsies. FOXP1 overexpression and knockdown
in osteosarcoma cell lines revealed that FOXP1 promoted proliferation, tumor
sphere formation, migration and invasion, and inhibited anoikis. Mechanistically,
FOXP1 acted as a repressor of P21 and RB (retinoblastoma protein) transcription, 
and directly interacted with the tumor suppressor p53 to inhibit its activity.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ERK/JNK) signaling
and c-JUN/c-FOS transcription factors were found to be upstream activators of
FOXP1. Moreover, FOXP1 silencing via lentivirus or adeno-associated virus
(AAV)-mediated delivery of shRNA suppressed osteosarcoma development and
progression in cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft animal models. Taken
together, we demonstrate that FOXP1, which is transactivated by
ERK/JNK-c-JUN/c-FOS, drives osteosarcoma development by regulating the p53-P21/RB
signaling cascade, suggesting that FOXP1 is a potential target for osteosarcoma
therapy.

Radiation resistance is a major cause of lung cancer treatment failure. Armadillo
(ARM) superfamily proteins participate in various fundamental cellular processes;
however, whether ARM proteins regulate radiation resistance is not fully
understood. Here, we used an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 library screen and identified
plakophilin 2 (PKP2), a member of the ARM superfamily of proteins, as a critical 
driver of radiation resistance in lung cancer. The PKP2 level was significantly
higher after radiotherapy than before radiotherapy, and high PKP2 expression
after radiotherapy predicted poor overall survival (OS) and postprogression
survival (PPS). Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis identified that PKP2 
was methylated at the arginine site and interacted with protein arginine
methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Methylation of PKP2 by PRMT1 stabilized β-catenin by
recruiting USP7, further inducing LIG4, a key DNA ligase in nonhomologous
end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Concomitantly, PKP2-induced radioresistance depended
on facilitating LIG4-mediated NHEJ repair in lung cancer. More strikingly, after 
exposure to irradiation, treatment with the PRMT1 inhibitor C-7280948 abolished
PKP2-induced radioresistance, and C-7280948 is a potential radiosensitizer in
lung cancer. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting the
PRMT1/PKP2/β-catenin/LIG4 pathway is an effective approach to overcome radiation 
resistance in lung cancer.

Cancer cells undergo metabolic adaption to sustain their survival and growth
under metabolic stress conditions, yet the underlying mechanism remains largely
unclear. It is also not known if lncRNAs contribute to this metabolic adaption of
cancer cells. Here we show that linc01564 is induced in response to glucose
deprivation by the transcription factor ATF4. Linc01564 functions to facilitate
hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival under glucose deprivation by activating
the serine synthesis pathway. Mechanistically, linc01564 acts as a competing
endogenous RNA for miR-107/103a-3p and attenuates the inhibitory effect of
miR-107/103a-3p on PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine synthesis
pathway, thereafter leading to increased PHGDH expression. Furthermore, linc01564
is able to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis via PHGDH. Together, these
findings suggest that linc01564 is an important player in the regulation of
metabolic adaption of cancer cells and also implicate linc01564 as a potential
therapeutic target for cancer.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is profoundly involved in epigenetic
regulation, especially for carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Mounting
evidence suggests that methyltransferase METTL3 regulates malignant behaviors of 
gastric cancer (GC). However, the clinical significance and biological
implication of SPHK2 and its related m6A modification in GC remain unclear. In
this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and
immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect the expression profiles and
prognostic significance of SPHK2 in GC. Here, we showed that increased SPHK2 was 
signified a poor prognosis of GC patients. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination
assays were used to investigate the possible mechanisms of SPHK2-mediated KLF2
expression. SPHK2 can promote the phosphorylation of KLF2, which triggers the
ubiquitination and degradation of KLF2 protein in GC. Methylated RNA
immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) was performed to uncover the m6A modification of
SPHK2 mRNA. METTL3 promotes translation of SPHK2 mRNA via an m6A-YTHDF1-dependent
manner. Functionally, SPHK2 facilitates GC cell proliferation, migration and
invasion by inhibiting KLF2 expression. SPHK2/KLF2 regulates the cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by METTL3 in GC. Overall, our
findings reveal that METTL3-mediated m6A modification of SPHK2 contributes to GC 
progression, which extends the understanding of the importance m6A methylation in
GC and represents a potential target for GC therapy.

Radiotherapy is essential to the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 
acquired or innate resistance to this therapeutic modality is a major clinical
problem. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in the radiation resistance
in NPC are not fully understood. Here, we reanalyzed the microarray data from
public databases and identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D 
(PTPRD) as a candidate gene. We found that PTPRD was downregulated in clinical
NPC tissues and NPC cell lines with its promoter hypermethylated. Functional
assays revealed that PTPRD overexpression sensitized NPC to radiation in vitro
and in vivo. Importantly, miR-454-3p directly targets PTPRD to inhibit its
expression and biological effect. Interestingly, mechanistic analyses indicate
that PTPRD directly dephosphorylates STAT3 to enhance Autophagy-Related 5 (ATG5) 
transcription, resulting in triggering radiation-induced autophagy. The
immunohistochemical staining of 107 NPC revealed that low PTPRD and high p-STAT3 
levels predicted poor clinical outcome. Overall, we showed that PTPRD promotes
radiosensitivity by triggering radiation-induced autophagy via the
dephosphorylation of STAT3, thus providing a potentially useful predictive
biomarker for NPC radiosensitivity and drug target for NPC radiosensitization.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal malignancies and
rapidly progressive diseases. Exosomes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are
emerging as vital mediators in tumor cells and their microenvironment. However,
the detailed roles and mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs in PDAC progression remain 
unknown. Here, we aimed to clarify the clinical significance and mechanisms of
exosomal lncRNA 01133 (LINC01133) in PDAC. We analyzed the expression of
LINC01133 in PDAC and found that exosomal LINC01133 expression was high and
positively correlated with higher TNM stage and poor overall survival rate of
PDAC patients. Further research demonstrated that Periostin could increase
exosome secretion and then enhance LINC01133 expression. In addition, Periostin
increased p-EGFR, p-Erk, and c-myc expression, and c-myc could bind to the
LINC01133 promoter region. These findings suggested that LINC01133 can be
regulated by Periostin via EGFR pathway activity. We also observed that LINC01133
promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cells. We subsequently evaluated the effect
of LINC01133 on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and confirmed that LINC01133 can
interact with Enhancer Of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and then promote H3K27
trimethylation. This can further silence AXIN2 and suppress GSK3 activity,
ultimately activating β-catenin. Collectively, these data indicate that exosomal 
LINC01133 plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression, and targeting 
LINC01133 may provide a potential treatment strategy for PDAC.

Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as
competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) targeting proteins and genes; however, the
role of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. We
investigated the mechanism by which lncRNA SNHG6 promotes the development of HCC.
RT-qPCR revealed upregulated lncRNA SNHG6 in the HCC setting. Elevated SNHG6
expression was indicative of poor prognosis in patients with HCC. SNHG6
overexpression resulted in increased cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and E2F1 expression
both in vitro and in vivo. SNHG6 also promoted HCC cell proliferation by
enhancing G1-S phase transition in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assays, RIP,
and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated SNHG6 competitively bound to miR-204-5p and
inhibited its expression preventing miR-204-5p from targeting E2F1.
Overexpression of miR-204-5p abolished the effect of SNHG6. Our data suggest that
SNHG6 functions as a ceRNA that targets miR-204-5p resulting in an increased E2F1
expression and enhanced G1-S phase transition, thereby promoting the
tumorigenesis of HCC.

MicroRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) primarily target the 3' UTR of mRNAs to
control their translation and stability. However, their co-regulatory effects on 
specific mRNAs in physiology and disease are yet to be fully explored. CSDE1 is
an RBP that promotes metastasis in melanoma and mechanisms underlying its
oncogenic activities need to be completely defined. Here we report that CSDE1
interacts with specific miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) in melanoma.
We find an association of CSDE1 with AGO2, the essential component of miRISC,
which is facilitated by target mRNAs and depends on the first cold shock domain
of CSDE1. Both CSDE1 and AGO2 bind to 3' UTR of PMEPA1. CSDE1 counters AGO2
binding, leading to an increase of PMEPA1 expression. We also identify a miRNA,
miR-129-5p, that represses PMEPA1 expression in melanoma. Collectively, our
results show that PMEPA1 promotes tumorigenic traits and that CSDE1 along with
miR-129-5p/AGO2 miRISC act antagonistically to fine-tune PMEPA1 expression toward
the progression of melanoma.

The molecular mechanisms of luminal cell differentiation are not understood well 
enough to determine how differentiation goes awry during oncogenesis. Using
RNA-Seq analysis, we discovered that CREB1 plays a central role in maintaining
new luminal cell survival and that oncogenesis dramatically changes the
CREB1-induced transcriptome. CREB1 is active in luminal cells, but not basal
cells. We identified ING4 and its E3 ligase, JFK, as CREB1 transcriptional
targets in luminal cells. During luminal cell differentiation, transient
induction of ING4 expression is followed by a peak in CREB1 activity, while JFK
increases concomitantly with CREB1 activation. Transient expression of ING4 is
required for luminal cell induction; however, failure to properly down-regulate
ING4 leads to luminal cell death. Consequently, blocking CREB1 increased ING4
expression, suppressed JFK, and led to luminal cell death. Thus, CREB1 is
responsible for the suppression of ING4 required for luminal cell survival and
maintenance. Oncogenic transformation by suppressing PTEN resulted in
constitutive activation of CREB1. However, the tumor cells could no longer fully 
differentiate into luminal cells, failed to express ING4, and displayed a unique 
CREB1 transcriptome. Blocking CREB1 in tumorigenic cells suppressed tumor growth 
in vivo, rescued ING4 expression, and restored luminal cell formation, but
ultimately induced luminal cell death. IHC of primary prostate tumors
demonstrated a strong correlation between loss of ING4 and loss of PTEN. This is 
the first study to define a molecular mechanism whereby oncogenic loss of PTEN,
leading to aberrant CREB1 activation, suppresses ING4 expression causing
disruption of luminal cell differentiation.

We provide evidence that a member of the human Schlafen (SLFN) family of
proteins, SLFN5, is overexpressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). Targeted deletion of SLFN5 results in decreased PDAC cell proliferation
and suppresses PDAC tumorigenesis in in vivo PDAC models. Importantly, high
expression levels of SLFN5 correlate with worse outcomes in PDAC patients,
implicating SLFN5 in the pathophysiology of PDAC that leads to poor outcomes. Our
studies establish novel regulatory effects of SLFN5 on cell cycle progression
through binding/blocking of the transcriptional repressor E2F7, promoting
transcription of key genes that stimulate S phase progression. Together, our
studies suggest an essential role for SLFN5 in PDAC and support the potential for
developing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
through SLFN5 targeting.

PR domain zinc finger protein 4 (PRDM4) is a transcription factor that plays key 
roles in stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. However, its biological role
and exact mechanism in cervical cancer remain unknown. Here, both
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot assays demonstrated that the
expression of PRDM4 in cervical cancer tissues was much lower than that in the
normal cervix. A xenograft assay showed that PRDM4 overexpression in the cervical
cancer cell lines SiHa and HeLa dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and
tumorigenic potential in vivo. Conversely, the silencing of PRDM4 promoted
cervical cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically,
PRDM4 induced cell cycle arrest at the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase by 
upregulating p27 and p21 expression and downregulating Cyclin D1 and CDK4
expression. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inactivated in
PRDM4-overexpressing cells, which decreased the levels of p-AKT and upregulated
the expression of PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, at both
the transcriptional and translational levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and
qChIP assays confirmed that PRDM4 transactivated the expression of PTEN by
binding to two specific regions in the PTEN promoter. Furthermore, PTEN silencing
or a PTEN inhibitor rescued the cell defects induced by PRDM4 overexpression.
Therefore, our data suggest that PRDM4 inhibits cell proliferation and

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, accounting for
high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms governing tumor growth and
metastasis in CRC require detailed investigation. The results of the present
study indicated that the transcription factor (TF) myocyte enhancer factor 2A
(MEF2A) plays a dual role in promoting proliferation and metastasis of CRC by
inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of
WNT/β-catenin signaling. Aberrant expression of MEF2A in CRC clinical specimens
was significantly associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Functionally,
MEF2A directly binds to the promoter region to initiate the transcription of ZEB2
and CTNNB1. Simultaneous activation of the expression of EMT-related TFs and
Wnt/β-catenin signaling by MEF2A overexpression induced the EMT and increased the
frequency of tumor formation and metastasis. The present study identified a new
critical oncogene involved in the growth and metastasis of CRC, providing a
potential novel therapeutic target for CRC intervention.

Poorly differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by aggressive
invasion and stromal fibroblast activation, which results in rapid progression
and poor therapeutic consequences. However, the regulatory mechanism involved
remains unclear. Here, we showed that ZNF37A, a member of KRAB-ZFP family, was
upregulated in poorly differentiated CRCs and associated with tumor metastasis.
ZNF37A enhanced the metastatic potential of multiple CRC cell lines and promoted 
distant metastasis in an orthotopic CRC model. Further investigation attributed
the ZNF37A-exacerbated metastasis to increased extracellular TGF-β and the
consequent activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in tumor
microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, ZNF37A formed a complex with KAP1 and
bound to the promoter of THSD4, a TME modulator, to suppress its transcription,
which is required for ZNF37A-mediated TGF-β activation and CRC metastasis.
Collectively, our study indicates that ZNF37A promotes TGF-β signaling in CRC
cells and activates CAFs by transcriptionally repressing THSD4 to drive CRC
metastasis, implicating ZNF37A as a potential biomarker for CRC differentiation
and progression.

Extramedullary infiltration (EMI), as a concomitant symptom of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), is associated with low complete remission and poor prognosis in
AML. However, the mechanism of EMI remains indistinct. Clinical trials showed
that increased miR-29s were associated with a poor overall survival in AML [14]. 
Nevertheless, they were proved to work as tumor suppressor genes by encouraging
apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in vitro. These contradictory results led 
us to the hypothesis that miR-29s may play a notable role in the prognosis of AML
rather than leukemogenesis. Thus, we explored the specimens of AML patients and
addressed this issue into miR-29c&b2 knockout mice. As a result, a poor overall
survival and invasive blast cells were observed in high miR-29c&b2-expression
patients, and the wildtype mice presented a shorter survival with heavier
leukemia infiltration in extramedullary organs. Subsequently, we found that the
miR-29c&b2 inside leukemia cells promoted EMI, but not the one in the
microenvironment. The analysis of signal pathway revealed that miR-29c&b2 could
target HMG-box transcription factor 1 (Hbp1) directly, then reduced Hbp1 bound to
the promoter of non-muscle myosin IIB (Myh10) as a transcript inhibitor. Thus,
increased Myh10 encouraged the migration of leukemia cells. Accordingly, AML
patients with EMI were confirmed to have high miR-29c&b2 and MYH10 with low HBP1.
Therefore, we identify that miR-29c&b2 contribute to the poor prognosis of AML
patients by promoting EMI, and related genes analyses are prospectively feasible 
in assessment of AML outcome.

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a vital regulator of tumor
metastasis. However, the mechanisms governing OXPHOS to facilitate tumor
metastasis remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that arginine 21(R21) and
lysine 108 (K108) of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 (MRPS23) was methylated 
by the protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) and SET-domain-containing
protein 6 (SETD6), respectively. R21 methylation accelerated the
poly-ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MRPS23 to a low level. The MRPS23
degradation inhibited OXPHOS with elevated mtROS level, which consequently
increased breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In contrast, K108
methylation increased MRPS23 stability, and K108 methylation coordinated with R21
methylation to maintain a low level of MRPS23, which was in favor of supporting
breast cancer cell survival through regulating OXPHOS. Consistently, R21 and K108
methylation was correlated with malignant breast carcinoma. Significantly, our
findings unveil a unique mechanism of controlling OXPHOS by arginine and lysine
methylation and point to the impact of the PRMT7-SETD6-MRPS23 axis during breast 
cancer metastasis.

The SNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has been shown to
act as a tumor suppressor through multiple mechanisms, including impairing the
ability of the oncoprotein transcription factor MYC to bind chromatin. Beyond
SNF5, however, it is unknown to what extent MYC can access additional SWI/SNF
subunits or how these interactions affect the ability of MYC to drive
transcription, particularly in SNF5-null cancers. Here, we report that MYC
interacts with multiple SWI/SNF components independent of SNF5. We show that MYC 
binds the pan-SWI/SNF subunit BAF155 through the BAF155 SWIRM domain, an
interaction that is inhibited by the presence of SNF5. In SNF5-null cells, MYC
binds with remaining SWI/SNF components to essential genes, although for a
purpose that is distinct from chromatin remodeling. Analysis of MYC-SWI/SNF
target genes in SNF5-null cells reveals that they are associated with core
biological functions of MYC linked to protein synthesis. These data reveal that
MYC can bind SWI/SNF in an SNF5-independent manner and that SNF5 modulates access
of MYC to core SWI/SNF complexes. This work provides a framework in which to
interrogate the influence of SWI/SNF on MYC function in cancers in which SWI/SNF 
or MYC are altered.

Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2) is a key member of
the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, while YES Proto-Oncogene 1 (YES1) is a
non-receptor tyrosine kinase (nRTK) and annexin A2 (ANXA2) belongs to the
calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family annexins. Here, we show
that EphA2, YES1, and ANXA2 form a signal axis, in which YES1 activated by EphA2 
phosphorylates ANXA2 at Tyr24 site, leading to ANXA2 activation and increased
ANXA2 nuclear distribution in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Overexpression (OE) of
YES1 increases, while knockdown (KD) of YES1 or ANXA2 decreases GC cell invasion 
and migration in vitro and tumor growth in mouse models. Reexpression of wildtype
(WT) rather than mutant ANXA2 (Tyr24F) in ANXA2 knockdown (ANXA2-KD) GC cells
restores YES1-induced cell invasion and migration, while neither WT nor mutant
ANXA2 (Tyr24F) can restore cell invasion and migration in YES1-KD GC cells. In
addition, the activation of EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 pathway is correlated with poor
prognosis. Thus, our results establish EphA2-YES1-ANXA2 axis as a novel pathway
that drives GC invasion and metastasis, targeting this pathway would be an
efficient way for the treatment of GC.

Activation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway modulates the
expression of genes involved in cell growth arrest, motility, and embryogenesis. 
An expression screen for long noncoding RNAs indicated that TGFβ induced
mir-100-let-7a-2-mir-125b-1 cluster host gene (MIR100HG) expression in diverse
cancer types, thus confirming an earlier demonstration of TGFβ-mediated
transcriptional induction of MIR100HG in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MIR100HG
depletion attenuated TGFβ signaling, expression of TGFβ-target genes, and
TGFβ-mediated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, MIR100HG silencing inhibited both
normal and cancer cell motility and enhanced the cytotoxicity of cytostatic
drugs. MIR100HG overexpression had an inverse impact on TGFβ signaling responses.
Screening for downstream effectors of MIR100HG identified the ligand TGFβ1.
MIR100HG and TGFB1 mRNA formed ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RNA-binding
protein HuR, promoting TGFβ1 cytokine secretion. In addition, TGFβ regulated
let-7a-2-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-125b-1-3p expression, all encoded by MIR100HG
intron-3. Certain intron-3 miRNAs may be involved in TGFβ/SMAD-mediated responses
(let-7a-2-3p) and others (miR-100, miR-125b) in resistance to cytotoxic drugs
mediated by MIR100HG. In support of a model whereby TGFβ induces MIR100HG, which 
then enhances TGFβ1 secretion, analysis of human carcinomas showed that MIR100HG 
expression correlated with expression of TGFB1 and its downstream extracellular
target TGFBI. Thus, MIR100HG controls the magnitude of TGFβ signaling via TGFβ1
autoinduction and secretion in carcinomas.

Esophageal cancer is a complex malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer
death worldwide. In Eastern Asia including China, about 90% of all incident cases
have esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mounting evidence elucidates that
aberrant expression of various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) contributes to ESCC
progression, but it remains unclear how small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are
involved in ESCC development. We systemically screened clinically relevant
snoRNAs in ESCC via integrative analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data
and validation in ESCC tissues. We found that snoRNA SNORD12B was one of the most
evidently upregulated snoRNAs in ESCC specimens and its high expression was
significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients. SNORD12B profoundly
promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of ESCC cells in
vitro and in vivo, indicating its oncogene nature. In particular, SNORD12B could 
interact with PP-1α, one of the three catalytic subunits of serine/threonine
protein phosphatase 1, which is a major phosphatase that directly
dephosphorylates AKT to suppress its activation. Interestingly, high levels of
SNORD12B in ESCC cells could break interactions between 14-3-3ζ and PP-1α,
abolish the retention of PP-1α in the cytosol by 14-3-3ζ and relocate PP-1α from 
the cytosol to the nucleus. This led to sequestered PP-1α in the nucleus,
enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the cytosol, activated AKT-mTOR-4EBP1
signaling, and, thus, ESCC progression. These insights would improve our
understanding of how snoRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis and highlight the
potential of snoRNAs as future therapeutic targets against cancers.

The t(8;21) fusion product, AML1/ETO, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)
form a feed-forward transcription loop that cooperatively transactivates the DNA 
methyltransferase 3a gene promoter that leads to DNA hypermethylation and drives 
leukemia cell growth. Suppression of the RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-reader
enzyme YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) specifically
compromises cancer stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but promotes
hematopoietic stem cell expansion without derailing normal hematopoiesis.
However, the relevance of expression between AML1/ETO-HIF1α loop and YTHDF2, and 
its functional relationship with t(8;21) AML have not been documented. Here, we
show that YTHDF2 is highly expressed in t(8;21) AML patients and associated with 
a higher risk of relapse and inferior relapse-free survival. Knockdown of YTHDF2 
in leukemia cells causes an impaired cell proliferation rate in vitro and in
mice. Mechanistically, HIF1α is able to bind to the hypoxia-response elements of 
the 5'-untranslated region of the YTHDF2 gene and promotes the transactivity of
the YTHDF2 promoter. Knockdown and overexpression of either AML1/ETO or HIF1α
resulted in decreased and increased YTHDF2 protein and mRNA expression in t(8;21)
AML cells. In particular, knockdown of YTHDF2 resulted in increased global mRNA
m6A levels in t(8;21) AML cells, accompanied by increased TNF receptor
superfamily member 1b (TNFRSF1b) mRNA and protein expression levels. Last, we
demonstrated that the m6A methylation and expression levels of the TNFRSF1b gene 
were both negatively correlated with HIF1α expression levels. In conclusion,
YTHDF2 is a downstream target of the AML1/ETO-HIF1α loop and promotes cell
proliferation probably by modulating the global m6A methylation in t(8;21) AML.

Despite the development of new targeted and immune therapies, the prognosis of
metastatic melanoma remains bleak. Therefore, it is critical to better understand
the mechanisms controlling advanced melanoma to develop more effective treatment 
regimens. Hedgehog/GLI (HH/GLI) signaling inhibitors targeting the central
pathway transducer Smoothened (SMO) have shown to be clinical efficacious in skin
cancer; however, several mechanisms of non-canonical HH/GLI pathway activation
limit their efficacy. Here, we identify a novel SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex
driving the expression of GLI1, the final effector of the HH/GLI pathway,
providing a novel mechanism of non-canonical SMO-independent activation of HH/GLI
signaling in melanoma. Consistently, we find a positive correlation between the
expression of GLI1 and SOX2 in human melanoma samples and cell lines. Further, we
show that combined targeting of canonical HH/GLI pathway with the SMO inhibitor
MRT-92 and of the SOX2-BRD4 complex using a potent Proteolysis Targeted Chimeras 
(PROTACs)-derived BRD4 degrader (MZ1), yields a synergistic anti-proliferative
effect in melanoma cells independently of their BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 mutational
status, with complete abrogation of GLI1 expression. Combination of MRT-92 and
MZ1 strongly potentiates the antitumor effect of either drug as single agents in 
an orthotopic melanoma model. Together, our data provide evidence of a novel
mechanism of non-canonical activation of GLI1 by the SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional
complex, and describe the efficacy of a new combinatorial treatment for a subset 
of melanomas with an active SOX2-BRD4-GLI1 axis.

An increasing number of studies have shown that long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are
involved in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of protein in a variety
of tumors. However, little is known about the exact regulation mechanism of
lncRNAs in regulating PTMs in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
proliferation. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript1 (MALAT1) and
GINS complex subunit 1(GINS1) both were upregulated and promoted proliferation
progression in NSCLC. In this study, the clinicopathologic significance of MALAT1
and GINS1 in NSCLC was investigated, a positive correlation in their expression
was found. The silencing of MALAT1 decreased GINS1 expression and inhibited NSCLC
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The upregulation of GINS1 reversed NSCLC
proliferation inhibited by MALAT1 knockdown. FOXP3 (forkhead box protein 3) was
identified as the critical transcription factor for GINS1 transcription. In
addition, MALAT1 could stabilize FOXP3 by binding to zinc finger (ZF) domain and 
leucine zipper (LZ) domain of FOXP3. Interestingly, these two domains were also
interaction domains for FOXP3 binding with E3 ligase STUB1 (STIP1 homology and
U-box containing protein 1). In this way, MALAT1 masked the protein-interacting
domain, and inhibited FOXP3 ubiquitination by STUB1. Together, our results
identified a novel regulatory axis of MALAT1-FOXP3-GINS1, and demonstrated that
MALAT1 played an important modulatory role in PTM of FOXP3 which affects GINS1
transcription and drives proliferation character in NSCLC.

There is overwhelming clinical evidence that the extracellular-regulated protein 
kinase 5 (ERK5) is significantly dysregulated in human breast cancer. However,
there is no definite understanding of the requirement of ERK5 in tumor growth and
metastasis due to very limited characterization of the pathway in disease models.
In this study, we report that a high level of ERK5 is a predictive marker of
metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistically, our in vitro data revealed that ERK5
was critical for maintaining the invasive capability of triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) cells through focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) activation.
Specifically, we found that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 was controlled by a 
kinase-independent function of ERK5. Accordingly, silencing ERK5 in mammary tumor
grafts impaired FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397 and suppressed TNBC cell metastasis
to the lung without preventing tumor growth. Collectively, these results
establish a functional relationship between ERK5 and FAK signaling in promoting
malignancy. Thus, targeting the oncogenic ERK5-FAK axis represents a promising
therapeutic strategy for breast cancer exhibiting aggressive clinical behavior.

Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Tumor-intrinsic properties 
can determine whether tumor metastasis occurs or not. Here, by comparing the gene
expression patterns in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with or without
metastasis, we found that Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1 (CTHRC1) in
primary CRC served as a metastasis-associated gene. Animal experiments verified
that CTHRC1 secreted by CRC cells promoted hepatic metastasis, which was closely 
correlated with macrophage infiltration. Depletion of macrophages by liposomal
clodronate largely abolished the promoting effect of CTHRC1 on CRC liver
metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CTHRC1 modulated macrophage
polarization to M2 phenotypes through TGF-β signaling. A mechanistic study
revealed that CTHRC1 bound directly to TGF-β receptor II and TGF-β receptor III, 
stabilized the TGF-β receptor complex, and activated TGF-β signaling. The
combination treatment of CTHRC1 monoclonal antibody and anti-PD-1 blocking
antibody effectively suppressed CRC hepatic metastasis. Taken together, our data 
demonstrated that CTHRC1 is an intrinsic marker of CRC metastasis and further
revealed that CTHRC1 promoted CRC liver metastasis by reshaping infiltrated
macrophages through TGF-β signaling, suggesting that CTHRC1 could be a potential 
biomarker for the early prediction of and a therapeutic target of CRC hepatic
metastasis.

The Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 22 (USP22) is a deubiquitinating subunit of the
mammalian SAGA transcriptional co-activating complex. USP22 was identified as a
member of the so-called "death-from-cancer" signature predicting therapy failure 
in cancer patients. However, the importance and functional role of USP22 in
different types and subtypes of cancer remain largely unknown. In the present
study, we leveraged human cell lines and genetic mouse models to investigate the 
role of USP22 in HER2-driven breast cancer (HER2+-BC) and demonstrate for the
first time that USP22 is required for the tumorigenic properties in murine and
human HER2+-BC models. To get insight into the underlying mechanisms, we
performed transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses and identified the Unfolded
Protein Response (UPR) as a pathway deregulated upon USP22 loss. The UPR is
normally induced upon extrinsic or intrinsic stresses that can promote cell
survival and recovery if shortly activated or programmed cell death if activated 
for an extended period. Strikingly, we found that USP22 actively suppresses UPR
induction in HER2+-BC cells by stabilizing the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
chaperone HSPA5. Consistently, loss of USP22 renders tumor cells more sensitive
to apoptosis and significantly increases the efficiency of therapies targeting
the ER folding capacity. Together, our data suggest that therapeutic strategies
targeting USP22 activity may sensitize tumor cells to UPR induction and could
provide a novel, effective approach to treat HER2+-BC.

Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) contributes to the invasive
progression of breast cancers by degrading extracellular matrix tissues.
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NME1/NM23-H1, has been identified as a metastasis 
suppressor; however, its contribution to local invasion in breast cancer is not
known. Here, we report that NME1 is up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) as compared to normal breast epithelial tissues. NME1 levels drop in
microinvasive and invasive components of breast tumor cells relative to
synchronous DCIS foci. We find a strong anti-correlation between NME1 and plasma 
membrane MT1-MMP levels in the invasive components of breast tumors, particularly
in aggressive histological grade III and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockout
of NME1 accelerates the invasive transition of breast tumors in the intraductal
xenograft model. At the mechanistic level, we find that MT1-MMP, NME1 and
dynamin-2, a GTPase known to require GTP production by NME1 for its membrane
fission activity in the endocytic pathway, interact in clathrin-coated vesicles
at the plasma membrane. Loss of NME1 function increases MT1-MMP surface levels by
inhibiting endocytic clearance. As a consequence, the ECM degradation and
invasive potentials of breast cancer cells are enhanced. This study identifies
the down-modulation of NME1 as a potent driver of the in situ-to invasive
transition during breast cancer progression.

BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) that target BRAF V600E kinase, a driver mutation found in
50% of melanomas, show a significant antitumor response, but the common emergence
of acquired resistance remains a challenge. Abnormal expression of RAF isoforms
CRAF and ARAF reactivates pERK1/2, which plays crucial roles in the acquisition
of resistance of melanoma cells. However, the mechanisms of dysregulation of RAF 
isoforms in resistant melanoma cells remain unknown. Here, we identified NONO
interacted with and stabilized both CRAF and ARAF in melanoma cells, and that
NONO was acetylated at 198K by p300 acetyltransferase, which stabilized NONO via 
antagonizing its ubiquitination/degradation mediated by RNF8. The upregulation of
both p300 and NONO promoted the rebound of pERK1/2 and the subsequent resistance 
of melanoma cells to BRAFi, and the activation of ERK1/2 in turn induced p300 to 
form a positive feedback loop in resistant melanoma cells. There was a positive
correlation between p300 and NONO in resistant melanoma cells and clinical
samples, and p300 inhibitor C646 overcame the resistance of resistant melanoma
cells to BRAF inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal that targeting
the positive feedback loop of p300-NONO-CRAF/ARAF-pERK1/2 may be excellent
strategies to overcome the resistance of BRAF inhibitors for melanoma patients.

Emerging evidences suggest that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in
tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Here, the aim of this study is to
investigate the biological function of long intervening noncoding RNA Linc00284
in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression levels of Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met
were evaluated by qPCR and/or Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to 
detect the expression of Ki67 and Phh3 in tumor tissues. The interaction between 
Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met was validated by luciferase reporter assay and RNA
immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Cell function experiments, including CCK-8,
wound-healing and transwell invasion assays, were conducted. The in vivo studies 
were performed with the subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse models. Our findings
reveal that Linc00284 is upregulated in CRC tissues and colorectal cancer cell
lines HCT116 and SW480 in comparison with corresponding para-carcinoma tissues
and human fetal colonic mucosa cells FHC. High expression of Linc00284 in tumor
tissues is associated with tumor metastasis and predicts a poor clinical outcome 
in CRC patients. Serum Linc00284 is increased, while miR-27a is decreased in CRC 
patients compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analysis indicates that serum
Linc00284 and miR-27a produce the area under the curve (AUC) value of at 0.8151
and 0.7316 in patients with colorectal cancer compared to healthy individuals,
respectively. Additionally, results in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that
Linc00284 silencing significantly suppresses CRC cell proliferation and/or
invasion. Mechanistically, Linc00284 promotes c-Met expression by acting as
miR-27a sponge, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways,
thereby causing malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. Taken together, Linc00284
exhibits oncogenic function and the disturbance of Linc00284/miR-27a/c-Met
regulatory axis contributes to CRC progression, providing new insight into the
pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Importantly, the expression levels of serum
Linc00284 and miR-27a may serve as clinical biomarkers for CRC diagnosis.

Hypoxia and related oxidative stress are closely related to the development and
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism mediated by
hypoxia in HCC has not yet been elucidated. Here, we found multifunction scaffold
protein p54nrb/NONO exerted pleiotropic effects to regulate hypoxia transcription
signals, thereby enhancing the progression of liver cancer. Extensive analysis of
clinical data demonstrated that NONO was significantly upregulated and
represented as a poor prognostic indicator of HCC. The crucial role of NONO in
driving angiogenesis and glycolysis, two well-known cancer phenotypes mediated by
hypoxia, was examined in vitro an in vivo. Mechanistically, NONO interacted with 
and stabilized both HIF-1 and HIF-2 complexes thus activating the transcription
of hypoxia-induced genes. Besides, NONO bound pre-mRNA and subsequent mRNA of
these genes to facilitate them splicing and mRNA stability, respectively. Thus,
NONO knockout seriously disrupted the expression of a cluster of HIF-1/2 targets 
and impeded hypoxia-enhanced progression in HCC. In conclusion, NONO functioned
as a multipurpose scaffold that interacted with HIF-1/2 complex and their
downstream transcripts to facilitate the expression of hypoxia-induced genes,
allowing malignant proliferation, indicating that NONO might be a potential
therapeutic target for HCC.

    J Urol. 2022 Jan;207(1):223-224.

Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer with limited treatment
option in males. Although the reactivation of embryonic signals in adult cells is
one of the characteristics of cancer, the underlying protein degradation
mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone GRP75 is a 
key player in PC cells by maintaining the protein stability of SIX1, a
transcription factor for embryonic development. Mechanistically, GRP75 provides a
platform to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 to inhibit K48-linked
polyubiquitination of SIX1. Structurally, the C-terminus of GRP75 (433-679 aa)
contains a peptide binding domain, which is required for the formation of
GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex. Functionally, pharmacological or genetic
inhibition of the GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex suppresses tumor growth and
overcomes the castration resistance of PC cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse

positively correlated with the expression of GRP75 and USP1. These new findings
not only enhance our understanding of the protein degradation mechanism, but also
may provide a potential way to enhance the anti-cancer activity of androgen
suppression therapy.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Glypican-5
(GPC5) is a member of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and its biological
importance in initiation and progression of lung cancer remains controversial. In
the present study, we revealed that GPC5 transcriptionally enhanced the
expression of CTDSP1 (miR-26b host gene) via AhR-ARNT pathway, and such
up-regulation of CTDSP1 intracellularly contributed to the inhibited
proliferation of lung cancer cells. Moreover, exosomes derived from
GPC5-overexpressing human lung cancer cells (GPC5-OE-derived exosomes) had an
extracellular repressive effect on human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs),
leading to decreased tube formation and migration. Comparison between GPC5-WT-
and GPC5-OE-derived exosomes showed that miR-26b (embedded within introns of
CTDSP1 gene) was significantly up-regulated in GPC5-OE-derived exosomes and
critical to the influence on hLECs. On the mechanism, we demonstrated that
miR-26b transferred into hLECs directly targeted to PTK2 3'-UTR and led to PTK2
down-regulation, resulting in defects in tube formation and migration of hLECs.
By uncovering the regulation network among GPC5, miR-26b, miR-26b host gene
(CTDSP1), and target gene (PTK2), our findings demonstrated that GPC5 functioned 
as a tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is aggressive and has poor clinical outcomes because of 
typically delayed diagnosis and a lack of effective non-surgical therapeutic
options. Recent studies have shown that plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein
(PLVAP) is related to angiogenesis in various tumors, and in vivo PLVAP targeting
therapy has been proven effective against hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic
cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the potential therapeutic utility
of targeting PLVAP and thus angiogenesis in CCA and explore the underlying
molecular mechanisms. We found that the PLVAP expression levels were
significantly higher in CCA tissues when compared with matched adjacent non-tumor
tissues obtained from a total of 90 CCA patients; higher expression levels of
PLVAP were associated with shorter overall survival of patients. In addition,
overexpression of PLVAP was associated with higher micro-vessel density in CCA
tissues. In a PLVAP overexpressing CCA patient-derived xenograft model, a novel
humanized anti-PLVAP antibody in combination with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin was 
significantly inhibited tumor growth. Molecular analysis of CCA cells co-cultured
with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells or human hepatic sinusoidal
endothelial cells showed that Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) secreted by CCA
cells activated the PI3K/Akt pathway after binding to its receptor,
cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), resulting in the upregulation of
PLVAP. Thus, CCA cells increased the angiogenic potency of endothelial cells in a
paracrine fashion. Consistently, patients bearing CKAP4 and PLVAP overexpressing 
tumors had a poor prognosis. In conclusion, the DKK1/CKAP4/PI3K/PLVAP pathway
increases angiogenesis in CCA and is therefore a potential anti-angiogenic
target.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients mostly suffer from poor survival
outcomes. It is necessary to identify effective therapeutic targets to improve
prognosis for HCC patients. Here, we report a new factor, CDCA2, in promoting HCC
development. CDCA2 amplification is an independent risk factor for the recurrence
and survival of HCC patients, which is positively correlated with elevated level 
of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), high histological grade, large tumor size, advanced
TNM stage, and poor prognosis for HCC patients. In HCC cells, CDCA2 promotes cell
growth and inhibits apoptosis. Mechanistically, CDCA2's transcription is
activated through the binding of E2F2/E2F8 with its promoter. CDCA2 depletion
contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
due to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated stress, which can be reversed by
antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH). Interestingly, we
found that CDCA2 triggers the BRCA1-NRF2 cascade, which elevates antioxidant
response and attenuates ROS levels. In response to oxidative stress, CDCA2
promotes BRCA1's chromatin relocalization to NRF2, activating NRF2-driven
downstream signaling (HO-1, TXNRD1, and NQO1), which then protects HCC cells
against oxidative damage. In conclusion, our results reveal that CDCA2 is a
prognostic biomarker for HCC patients, and present the
E2F2/E2F8-CDCA2-BRCA1-NRF2-ROS signaling axis that have implications for HCC
therapeutics.

Recurrence of metastatic breast cancer stemming from acquired endocrine and
chemotherapy resistance remains a health burden for women with luminal (ER+)
breast cancer. Disseminated ER+ tumor cells can remain viable but quiescent for
years to decades. Contributing factors to metastatic spread include the
maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Breast CSCs
frequently exist as a minority population in therapy resistant tumors. In this
study, we show that cytoplasmic complexes composed of steroid receptor (SR)
co-activators, PELP1 and SRC-3, modulate breast CSC expansion through
upregulation of the HIF-activated metabolic target genes PFKFB3 and PFKFB4.
Seahorse metabolic assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic PELP1 influences cellular
metabolism by increasing both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. PELP1
interacts with PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 proteins, and inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4
kinase activity blocks PELP1-induced tumorspheres and protein-protein
interactions with SRC-3. PFKFB4 knockdown inhibited in vivo emergence of
circulating tumor cell (CTC) populations in mammary intraductal (MIND) models.
Application of PFKFB inhibitors in combination with ER targeted therapies blocked
tumorsphere formation in multiple models of advanced breast cancer including
tamoxifen (TamR) and paclitaxel (TaxR) resistant models, murine tumor cells, and 
ER+ patient-derived organoids (PDxO). Together, our data suggest that PELP1,
SRC-3, and PFKFBs cooperate to drive ER+ tumor cell populations that include CSCs
and CTCs. Identifying non-ER pharmacological targets offers a useful approach to 
blocking metastatic escape from standard of care ER/estrogen (E2)-targeted
strategies to overcome endocrine and chemotherapy resistance.

Research over the past decade has suggested important roles for pseudogenes in
glioma. This study aimed to show that pseudogene PRELI domain-containing 1
pseudogene 6 (PRELID1P6) promotes glioma progression. Aberrant expression of
genes was screened using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We found that mRNA
level of PRELID1P6 was highly upregulated in glioma and was associated with a
shorter survival time. Functional studies showed that the knockdown of PRELID1P6 
decreased cell proliferation, sphere formation, and clone formation ability and
blocked the cell cycle transition at G0/G1, while overexpression of PRELID1P6 had
the opposite effects. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRELID1P6 changed the
cellular localization of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1)
from nucleus to cytoplasm, which promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
hnRNPH1. RNA-sequence and gene set enrichment analysis suggested that knockdown
of PRELID1P6 regulates the apoptosis signaling pathway. Western blotting showed
that PRELID1P6 increased TRF2 expression by hnRNPH1-mediated alternative splicing
effect and activated the Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, Akt inhibitor MK2206
treatment reversed the oncogenic function of PRELID1P6. PRELID1P6 was also found 
to be negatively regulated by miR-1825. Our result showed that PRELID1P6 promotes
glioma progression through the hnHNPH1-Akt/mTOR pathway. These findings shed new 
light on the important role of PRELID1P6 as a novel oncogene for glioma.

MPDZ also named MUPP1 is involved in signal transduction mediated by the
formation of protein complexes. However, the expression regulation, clinical
significance, potential function, and mechanism of this gene in lung cancer
remain unclear. Methylation status of MPDZ was measured by methylation-specific
PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses
were performed to identify the prognostic value of MPDZ. The tumor suppressing
effects of MPDZ were determined in vitro and in vivo. The target molecules and
signaling pathway that mediated the function of MPDZ were also identified. MPDZ
methylation was identified in 61.2% of primary lung cancer tissues and most lung 
cancer cell lines but not in normal lung tissues. MPDZ expression was
significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues and negatively associated with
DNA hypermethylation, and attenuated MPDZ expression predicted a poor outcome.
Furthermore, MPDZ overexpression prominently dampened cell growth, migration, and
invasion of tumor cells. Conversely, MPDZ knockdown promoted cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MPDZ deficiency promotes 
tumor metastasis and reduces the survival of MPDZ knockout mice. Importantly,
MPDZ promotes tumor suppressor ability that depends on the Hippo pathway-mediated
repression of YAP. MPDZ activates the phosphorylation of YAP (Ser127) and
inhibits YAP expression through stabilizing MST1 and interaction with LATS1. We
first identified and validated that MPDZ methylation and expression could be a
good diagnostic marker and independent prognostic factor for lung cancer. MPDZ
functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion through regulating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is overexpressed in various cancers and promotes cancer cell
proliferation by binding to cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4). However,
the mechanisms underlying DKK1 expression are poorly understood. RNA sequence
analysis revealed that expression of the transcription factor forkhead box M1
(FOXM1) and its target genes concordantly fluctuated with expression of DKK1 in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. DKK1 knockdown decreased FOXM1
expression and vice versa in PDAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
cells. Inhibition of either the DKK1-CKAP4-AKT pathway or the ERK pathway
suppressed FOXM1 expression, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways showed 
synergistic effects. A FOXM1 binding site was identified in the 5'-untranslated
region of the DKK1 gene, and its depletion decreased DKK1 expression and cancer
cell proliferation. Clinicopathological and database analysis revealed that PDAC 
and ESCC patients who simultaneously express DKK1 and FOXM1 have a poorer
prognosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that expression of both DKK1 and
FOXM1 is the independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients. Although it has been
reported that FOXM1 enhances Wnt signaling, FOXM1 induced DKK1 expression
independently of Wnt signaling in PDAC and ESCC cells. These results suggest that
DKK1 and FOXM1 create a positive feedback loop to promote cancer cell
proliferation.

Asporin (ASPN) presents in the tumor microenvironment and exhibits a
cancer-promoting effect as a stroma protein. Even though ASPN has already been
observed inside cancer cells, the functions of intracellular ASPN and its
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we reported that ASPN was upregulated 
in different stages of gastric cancer (GC), and associated with a poor prognosis.
Moreover, we found that ASPN markedly inhibited GC cell apoptosis and promoted
cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism investigations revealed that 
ASPN directly binding to lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and promoted
LEF1-mediated gene transcription independent of β-catenin, the classic co-factor 
in the Wnt/LEF1 pathway. We also demonstrated that ASPN selectively facilitated
LEF1 binding to and activating the promoters of PTGS2, IL6, and WISP1 to promote 
their transcription. The suppression of cell apoptosis by ASPN overexpression
could be attenuated by LEF1 knockdown or 100 µM aspirin (PTGS2 inhibitor), and
siASPN mediated apoptosis could be rescued by LEF1 ectopic expression or adding
recombinant IL6. Therefore, we concluded that ASPN repressed GC cell apoptosis
via activating LEF1-mediated gene transcription independent of β-catenin, which
could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in GC patients.

Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are critical components of
DNA-replication-licensing factors. MCM8 is an MCM protein that exhibits oncogenic
functions in several human malignancies. However, the role of MCM8 in
glioblastomas (GBMs) has remained unclear. In the present study, we investigated 
the biological functions and mechanisms of MCM8 in glioma stem cells (GSCs). The 
clinical relevance of MCM8 mRNA expression was explored via TCGA and REMBRANDT
datasets. The effects of MCM8 on the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GSCs were
examined both in vitro and in vivo. The regulation of MCM8 expression and its
interacting proteins were also evaluated. We found that the expression of MCM8
was elevated in high-grade gliomas and classical molecular subtypes and was
inversely correlated with patient prognosis. GSCs had a significantly higher
expression of MCM8 compared with that in normal glioma cells. Silencing of MCM8
induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis, as well as inhibited the proliferation and
self-renewal of GSCs. Forced expression of MCM8 enhanced clonogenicity of GSCs
both in vitro and in vivo. MCM8 expression was regulated by EGFR signaling, which
was mediated by NF-κB (p65). MCM8 interacted with DNA-replication-initiating
factors-including EZH2, CDC6, and CDCA2-and influenced these factors to associate
with chromatin. In addition, MCM8 knockdown increased the sensitivity of GSCs to 
radiation and TMZ treatments. Our findings suggest that MCM8, regulated by the
EGFR pathway, maintains the clonogenic and tumorigenic potential of GSCs through 
interaction with DNA-replication-initiating factors; hence, MCM8 may represent a 
novel therapeutic target in GBMs.

SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) is a multiprotein complex essential for 
the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. SWI/SNF complex genes are
genetically altered in over 20% of human malignancies, but the aberrant
regulation of the SWI/SNF subunit genes and subsequent dysfunction caused by
abnormal expression of subunit gene in cancer, remain poorly understood. Among
the SWI/SNF subunit genes, SMARCA4, SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 were identified to be
overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modulation of SMARCA4,
SMARCC1, and SMARCA2 inhibited in vitro tumorigenesis of HCC cells. However,
SMARCA4-targeting elicited remarkable inhibition in an in vivo Ras-transgenic
mouse HCC model (Ras-Tg), and high expression levels of SMARCA4 significantly
associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, most HCC patients
(72-86%) showed SMARCA4 overexpression compared to healthy controls. To identify 
SMARCA4-specific active enhancers, mapping, and analysis of chromatin state in
liver cancer cells were performed. Integrative analysis of SMARCA4-regulated
genes and active chromatin enhancers suggested 37 genes that are strongly
activated by SMARCA4 in HCC. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and
luciferase assays, we demonstrated that SMARCA4 activates Interleukin-1
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression through IRAK1 active enhancer in 
HCC. We then showed that transcriptional activation of IRAK1 induces oncoprotein 
Gankyrin and aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) in HCC. The
regulatory mechanism of the SMARCA4-IRAK1-Gankyrin, AKR1B10 axis was further
demonstrated in HCC cells and in vivo Ras-Tg mice. Our results suggest that
aberrant overexpression of SMARCA4 causes SWI/SNF to promote IRAK1 enhancer to
activate oncoprotein Gankyrin and AKR1B10, thereby contributing to
hepatocarcinogenesis.

As a key cell cycle regulator, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) has been recognized as a
crucial factor involved in the progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). However,
its regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that
Plk1 is a novel substrate of vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2), a serine-threonine
kinase that is highly expressed and predicts poor prognosis in PC. VRK2
phosphorylates Plk1 at threonine 210 and protects it from ubiquitin-dependent
proteasomal degradation. We showed that mechanistically complement factor
H-related protein (CFHR), as a major E3 ligase, promotes Plk1 degradation by
ubiquitinating it at lysine 209. Phosphorylation of Plk1 at threonine 210 by VRK2
interferes with the interaction of Chfr with Plk1 and antagonizes Plk1
ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing the Plk1 protein. Taken together, our data
reveal a mechanism of Plk1 overexpression in PC and provide evidence for
targeting VRK2 as a potential therapeutic strategy.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) progression. However, the specific functions of lncRNAs in alternative
splicing (AS) and the metastatic cascade in liver cancer remain largely unclear. 
In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA, LINC01348, which was significantly
downregulated in HCC and correlated with survival functions in HCC patients.
Ectopic expression of LINC01348 induced marked inhibition of cell growth, and
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, these phenotypes were reversed upon 
knockdown of LINC01348. Mechanistically, LINC01348 complexed with splicing factor
3b subunit 3 (SF3B3) acted as a modulator of EZH2 pre-mRNA AS, and induced
alterations in JNK/c-Jun activity and expression of Snail. Notably, C-terminal
truncated HBx (Ct-HBx) negatively regulated LINC01348 through c-Jun signaling.
Our data collectively highlight those novel regulatory associations involving
LINC01348/SF3B3/EZH2/JNK/c-Jun/Snail are an important determinant of metastasis
in HCC cells and support the potential utility of targeting LINC01348 as a
therapeutic strategy for HCC.

Oxaliplatin (oxa) is widely used in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), but
the development of oxaliplatin resistance is a major obstacle to the therapeutic 
efficacy in patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous noncoding RNAs measuring
between 22 and 24 nucleotides, have been shown to be involved in the development 
of CRC drug resistance. However, the mechanism by which differentially expressed 
miRNAs induce chemotherapy resistance in CRC has not been fully elucidated to
date. Here, we showed the differentially expressed miRNAs in
oxaliplatin-sensitive and oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells through miRNA
microarray technology and found that miR-135b-5p was significantly increased in
oxaliplatin-resistant cells. And miR-135b-5p was increased in the serum of
colorectal cancer patients. More importantly, the miR-135b-5p level in the serum 
of oxaliplatin-resistant patients was further increased compared to that of
oxaliplatin-sensitive patients. Recent studies have shown that protective
autophagy is an important mechanism that promotes drug resistance in tumors. The 
potential role of miR-135b-5p in inducing protective autophagy and promoting
oxaliplatin resistance was evaluated in two stable oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell
lines and their parental cells. We further identified MUL1 as a direct downstream
target of miR-135b-5p and showed that MUL1 could degrade the key molecule of
autophagy, ULK1, through ubiquitination. Mouse xenograft models were adopted to
evaluate the correlation between miR-135b-5p and oxaliplatin-induced autophagy in
vivo. Furthermore, we also investigated the regulatory factors for the
upregulation of miR-135b-5p in CRC cells under oxaliplatin chemotoxicity. These
results indicated that miR-135b-5p upregulation in colorectal cancer could induce
protective autophagy through the MUL1/ULK1 signaling pathway and promote
oxaliplatin resistance. Targeting miR-135b-5p may provide a new treatment
strategy for reversing oxaliplatin resistance in CRC.

Glycolysis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the metastatic tumor
microenvironment. A series of lncRNAs have been identified to function as
oncogenic molecules by regulating glycolysis. However, the roles of
glycolysis-related lncRNAs in regulating colorectal cancer liver metastasis
(CRLM) remain poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of the
glycolysis-related lncRNA MIR17HG gradually increased from adjacent normal to CRC
to the paired liver metastatic tissues, and high MIR17HG expression predicted
poor survival, especially in patients with liver metastasis. Functionally,
MIR17HG promoted glycolysis in CRC cells and enhanced their invasion and liver
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MIR17HG functioned as a ceRNA
to regulate HK1 expression by sponging miR-138-5p, resulting in glycolysis in CRC
cells and leading to their invasion and liver metastasis. More interestingly,
lactate accumulated via glycolysis activated the p38/Elk-1 signaling pathway to
promote the transcriptional expression of MIR17HG in CRC cells, forming a
positive feedback loop, which eventually resulted in persistent glycolysis and
the invasion and liver metastasis of CRC cells. In conclusion, the present study 
indicates that the lactate-responsive lncRNA MIR17HG, acting as a ceRNA, promotes
CRLM through a glycolysis-mediated positive feedback circuit and might be a novel
biomarker and therapeutic target for CRLM.

Numerous studies suggest an important role for copy number alterations (CNAs) in 
cancer progression. However, CNAs of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in
ovarian cancer (OC) and their potential functions have not been fully
investigated. Here, based on analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database,
we identified in this study an oncogenic lincRNA termed LINC00662 that exhibited 
a significant correlation between its CNA and its increased expression. LINC00662
overexpression is highly associated with malignant features in OC patients and is
a prognostic indicator. LINC00662 significantly promotes OC cell proliferation
and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00662 is stabilized by 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1). Moreover, LINC00662 exerts 
oncogenic effects by interacting with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and
preventing its ubiquitination in OC cells, leading to activation of the oncogenic
p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results define an oncogenic role 
for LINC00662 in OC progression mediated via GRP78/p38 signaling, with potential 
implications regarding therapeutic targets for OC.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) have been widely used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but
the development of acquired resistance remains a therapeutic hurdle. The
reduction of glucose uptake has been implicated in the anti-tumor activity of
EGFR TKIs. In this study, the upregulation of the active sodium/glucose
co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) was found to confer the development of acquired EGFR TKI
resistance and was correlated with the poorer clinical outcome of the NSCLC
patients who received EGFR TKI treatment. Blockade of SGLT1 overcame this
resistance in vitro and in vivo by reducing glucose uptake in NSCLC cells.
Mechanistically, SGLT1 protein was stabilized through the interaction with
PKCδ-phosphorylated (Thr678) EGFR in the TKI-resistant cells. Our findings
revealed that PKCδ/EGFR axis-dependent SGLT1 upregulation was a critical
mechanism underlying the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. We suggest
co-targeting PKCδ/SGLT1 as a potential strategy to improve the therapeutic
efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC patients.

Metastasis is the main cause of death in breast cancer patients. The initial step
of metastasis is invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation,
which enables local breast tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues. However,
the molecular mechanism underlying invadopodia-mediated metastasis remains
largely unknown. Here we found that the RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1)
exhibited elevated expression in invasive breast tumors and promoted lung
metastasis of mammary cancer cells. Suppression of Msi1 reduced invadopodia
formation in mammary cancer cells. Furthermore, Msi1 deficiency decreased the
expression and activity of Mmp9, an important enzyme in ECM degradation.
Mechanistically, Msi1 directly suppressed Timp3, an endogenous inhibitor of Mmp9.
In clinical breast cancer specimens, TIMP3 and MSI1 levels were significantly
inversely correlated both in normal breast tissue and breast cancer tissues and
associated with overall survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our
findings demonstrate that the MSI1-TIMP3-MMP9 cascade is critical for
invadopodia-mediated onset of metastasis in breast cancer, providing novel
insights into a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer metastasis.

The primary chemotherapy of ovarian cancer (OC) often acquires chemoresistance.
Sorcin (SRI), a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein, has been
reported to be an oncogenic protein in cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms 
of SRI regulation and the role and aberrant expression of SRI in chemoresistant
OC remain unclear. Here, we identified SRI as a key driver of paclitaxel
(PTX)-resistance and explored its regulatory mechanism. Using transcriptome
profiles, qRT-PCR, proteomics, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and
bioinformatics analyses, we found that SRI was overexpressed in PTX-resistant OC 
cells and the overexpression of SRI was related to the poor prognosis of
patients. SRI was a key molecule required for growth, migration, and
PTX-resistance in vitro and in vivo and was involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and stemness. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-142-5p
directly bound to the 3'-UTR of SRI to suppress its expression, whereas a
transcription factor zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) inhibited the
transcription of miR-142-5p by directly binding to the E-box fragment in the
miR-142 promoter region. Furthermore, ZEB1 was negatively regulated by SRI which 
physically interacted with Smad4 to block its translocation from the cytosol to
the nucleus. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel homeostatic loop of SRI 
that drives the PTX-resistance and malignant progression via
Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p in human OC. Targeting this SRI/Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p loop 
may reverse the PTX-resistance.

Previous study demonstrated that most long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as 
competing endogenous RNAs or molecular sponges to negatively modulate miRNA and
regulate tumor development. However, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in
cancer are not fully understood. Our study describes the role of the lncRNA SPRY4
intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) in cancer metastasis by mechanisms related to
Staufen1 (STAU1)-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). Briefly, we found that, high
SPRY4-IT1 expression was associated with aggressiveness and poor outcome in human
colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, functional assays
revealed that SPRY4-IT1 significantly promoted colorectal, breast and ovarian
cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, microarray analyses
identified several differentially-expressed genes upon SPRY4-IT1 overexpression
in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells. Among them, the 3'-UTR of transcription
elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1) mRNA can base-pair with the Alu element in 
the 3'-UTR of SPRY4-IT1. Moreover, SPRY4-IT1 was found to bind STAU1, promote
STAU1 recruitment to the 3'-UTR of TCEB1 mRNA, and affect TCEB1 mRNA stability
and expression, resulting in hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) upregulation,
and thereby affecting cancer cell metastasis. In addition, STAU1 depletion
abrogated TCEB1 SMD and alleviated the pro-metastatic effect of SPRY4-IT1
overexpression. Significantly, we revealed that SPRY4-IT1 is also transactivated 
by NF-κB/p65, which activates SPRY4-IT1 to inhibit TCEB1 expression, and
subsequently upregulate HIF-1α. In conclusion, our results highlight a novel
mechanism of cytoplasmic lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 in which SPRY4-IT1 affecting TCEB1 mRNA
stability via STAU1-mediated degradation during cancer metastasis.

Cyclin D1 is an essential regulator of the G1-S cell-cycle transition and is
overexpressed in many cancers. Expression of cyclin D1 is under tight cellular
regulation that is controlled by many signaling pathways. Here we report that
PARP14, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, is a regulator
of cyclin D1 expression. Depletion of PARP14 leads to decreased cyclin D1 protein
levels. In cells with a functional retinoblastoma (RB) protein pathway, this
results in G1 cell-cycle arrest and reduced proliferation. Mechanistically, we
found that PARP14 controls cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Using luciferase assays, we
show that PARP14 specifically regulates cyclin D1 3'UTR mRNA stability. Finally, 
we also provide evidence that G1 arrest in PARP14-depleted cells is dependent on 
an intact p53-p21 pathway. Our work uncovers a new role for PARP14 in promoting
cell-cycle progression through both cyclin D1 and the p53 pathway.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest cancer mainly owing to
its proclivity to early metastasis and the lack of effective targeted therapeutic
drugs. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying early invasion
and metastasis by PDAC is imperative for improving patient outcomes. The present 
study identified that upregulation of TSPAN8 expression in PDAC facilitates
metastasis in vivo and in vitro. We found SOX9 as a key transcriptional regulator
of TSPAN8 expression in response to EGF stimulation. SOX9 modulation was
sufficient to positively regulate endogenous expression of TSPAN8, with
concomitant in vitro phenotypic changes such as loss of cell-matrix adherence and
increased invasion. Moreover, increased SOX9 and TSPAN8 levels were shown to
correlate in human pancreatic cancer specimens and downregulated in vitro by EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. High expression of SOX9 and TSPAN8 has been
associated with tumor stage, poor prognosis and poor patient survival in PDAC. In
conclusion, this study highlights the importance of the EGF-SOX9-TSPAN8 signaling
cascade in the control of PDAC invasion and implies that TSPAN8 may be a
promising novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PDAC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells have low or absent tumor cell PD-L1 expression that
we previously demonstrated can confer chemotherapy resistance. Here, we
demonstrate that PD-L1 depletion enhances JNK activity resulting in increased
BimThr116 phosphorylation and its sequestration by MCL-1 and BCL-2. Activated JNK
signaling in PD-L1-depeted cells was due to reduced mRNA stability of the CYLD
deubiquitinase. PD-L1 was found to compete with the ribonuclease EXOSC10 for
binding to CYLD mRNA. Thus, loss of PD-L1 promoted binding and degradation of
CYLD mRNA by EXOSC10 which enhanced JNK activity. An irreversible JNK inhibitor
(JNK-IN-8) reduced BimThr116 phosphorylation and unsequestered Bim from MCL-1 and
BCL-2 to promote apoptosis. In cells lacking PD-L1, treatment with JNK-IN-8, an
MCL-1 antagonist (AZD5991), or their combination promoted apoptosis and reduced
long-term clonogenic survival by anticancer drugs. Similar effects of the JNK
inhibitor on cell viability were observed in CRC organoids with suppression of
PD-L1. These data indicate that JNK inhibition may represent a promising strategy
to overcome drug resistance in CRC cells with low or absent PD-L1 expression.

Angiogenesis is essential for the sustained growth of solid tumors.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of angiogenesis and
constitutive activation of HIF-1 is frequently observed in human cancers.
Therefore, understanding the mechanisms governing the activation of HIF-1 is
critical for successful therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis. Herein, we
establish a new regulatory mechanism responsible for the constitutive activation 
of HIF-1α in cancer, irrespective of oxygen tension. PIM1 kinase directly
phosphorylates HIF-1α at threonine 455, a previously uncharacterized site within 
its oxygen-dependent degradation domain. This phosphorylation event disrupts the 
ability of prolyl hydroxylases to bind and hydroxylate HIF-1α, interrupting its
canonical degradation pathway and promoting constitutive transcription of HIF-1
target genes. Moreover, phosphorylation of the analogous site in HIF-2α (S435)
stabilizes the protein through the same mechanism, indicating post-translational 
modification within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain as a mechanism of
regulating the HIF-α subunits. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that
expression of PIM1 is sufficient to stabilize HIF-1α and HIF-2α in normoxia and
stimulate angiogenesis in a HIF-1-dependent manner. CRISPR mutants of HIF-1α
(Thr455D) promoted increased tumor growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
Moreover, HIF-1α-T455D xenograft tumors were refractory to the anti-angiogenic
and cytotoxic effects of PIM inhibitors. These data identify a new signaling axis
responsible for hypoxia-independent activation of HIF-1 and expand our
understanding of the tumorigenic role of PIM1 in solid tumors.

Cancer cells show increases in protein degradation pathways, including autophagy,
during progression to meet the increased protein degradation demand and support
cell survival. On the other hand, reduced autophagy activity during aging is
associated with a reduced DNA damage response and increased genomic instability. 
Therefore, it is a puzzling how DNA repair can be increased in cancer cells that 
are resistant to chemotherapies or during progression when autophagy activity is 
intact or increased. We discovered that tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44)
is a pivotal element regulating the DNA damage response in cancer cells with
intact autophagy. TRIM44 deubiquitinates p62, an autophagy substrate, which leads
to its oligomerization. This prevents p62 localization to the nucleus upon
irradiation. Increased cytoplasmic retention of p62 by TRIM44 prevents the
degradation of FLNA and 53BP1, which increases DNA damage repair. Together, our
data support TRIM44 a potential therapeutic target for therapy-resistant tumor
cells with intact autophagy.

Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the fourth-most common cancer in women in the
United States, and generally carries a favorable prognosis. However, about 10% of
EC patients have a rare and aggressive form, uterine serous papillary carcinoma
(USPC), which carries a much higher mortality rate. The developmental
transcription factor PAX8 is expressed in nearly 100% of USPCs. We show that PAX8
plays a critical antiapoptotic role in USPC and this role is established via
transcriptional activation of two aberrant signaling pathways. First, PAX8
positively regulates mutated p53, and missense p53 mutations have an oncogenic
gain of function effect. Second, PAX8 directly transcriptionally regulates p21,
in a p53-independent manner, and p21 acquires a growth promoting role that is
mediated via cytoplasmic localization of the protein. We propose that mutated p53
and cytoplasmic p21 can independently mediate the pro-proliferative role of PAX8 
in USPC. In addition, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to detect
pathways that are regulated by PAX8, and propose that metabolism and HIF-1alpha
-related pathways are potential candidates for mediating the role of PAX8 in
USPC. Taken together our findings demonstrate for the first time that PAX8 is an 
essential lineage marker in USPC, and suggest its mechanism of action.

Cancer metastasis causes >90% of cancer deaths and remains a major treatment
challenge. Here we deciphered the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation of MACC1, a 
causative driver for cancer metastasis, for cancer cell signaling and novel
interventions to restrict cancer metastasis. We identified MACC1 as new MEK1
substrate. MEK1 directly phosphorylates MACC1, leading to accelerated and
increased ERK1 activation. Mutating in silico predicted hierarchical MACC1
tyrosine phosphorylation sites abrogates MACC1-induced migration, invasion, and
MET expression, a transcriptional MACC1 target. Targeting MEK1 by RNAi or
clinically applicable MEK1 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK1120212 reduces MACC1
tyrosine phosphorylation and restricts MACC1-induced metastasis formation in
mice. Although MEK1 levels, contrary to MACC1, are not of prognostic relevance
for CRC patients, MEK1 expression was found indispensable for MACC1-induced
metastasis. This study identifies MACC1 as new MEK1 substrate for tyrosine
phosphorylation decisively impacting cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis.
Thus, MAP kinase signaling is not linear leading to ERK activation, but branches 
at the level of MEK1. This fundamental finding opens new therapeutic options for 
targeting the MEK1/MACC1 axis as novel vulnerability in patients at high risk for
metastasis. This might be extended from CRC to further solid tumor entities.

Homologous recombination (HR) repair is an important determinant of
chemosensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying HR regulation remain largely
unknown. Cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1) is a member of the
LIM/double-zinc finger protein family and is overexpressed and associated with
prognosis in several tumor types. However, to date, the functional role of CRIP1 
in cancer biology is poorly understood. Here we found that CRIP1 downregulation
causes HR repair deficiency with concomitant increase in cell sensitivity to
cisplatin, epirubicin, and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
olaparib in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, upon DNA damage, CRIP1 is
deubiquitinated and upregulated by activated AKT signaling. CRIP1, in turn,
promotes nuclear enrichment of RAD51, which is a prerequisite step for HR
commencement, by stabilizing BRCA2 to counteract FBXO5-targeted RAD51 degradation
and by binding to the core domain of RAD51 (RAD51184-257) in coordination with
BRCA2, to facilitate nuclear export signal masking interactions between BRCA2 and
RAD51. Moreover, through mass spectrometry screening, we found that KPNA4 is at
least one of the carriers controlling the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of the 
CRIP1-BRCA2-RAD51 complex in response to chemotherapy. Consistent with these
findings, RAD51 inhibitors block the CRIP1-mediated HR process, thereby restoring
chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer cells with high CRIP1 expression.
Analysis of patient specimens revealed an abnormally high level of CRIP1
expression in GC tissues compared to that in the adjacent normal mucosa and a
significant negative association between CRIP1 expression and survival time in
patient cohorts with different types of solid tumors undergoing genotoxic
treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests an essential function of CRIP1 in
promoting HR repair and facilitating gastric cancer cell adaptation to genotoxic 
therapy.

Epigenetic alterations have been previously shown to contribute to multiple
myeloma (MM) pathogenesis via DNA methylations and histone modifications. RNA
methylation, a novel epigenetic modification, is required for cancer cell
survival, and targeting this pathway has been proposed as a new therapeutic
strategy. The extent to the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-regulatory pathway functions
in MM remains unknown. Here, we show that an imbalance of RNA methylation may
underlies the tumorigenesis of MM. Mechanistically, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2
(IDH2) is highly expressed in CD138+ cells from MM and its levels appear a
progressive increase in the progression of plasma cell dyscrasias. Downregulation
of IDH2 increases global m6A RNA levels and reduces myeloma cell growth in vitro,
decreases the burden of disease and prolongs overall survival in vivo. IDH2
regulates RNA methylation by activating the RNA demethylase FTO, which is an
α-KG-dependent dioxygenase. Furthermore, IDH2-mediated FTO activation decreases
the m6A level on WNT7B transcripts, then increases WNT7B expression and thus
activated Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, survival analysis indicates that the
elevated expression of IDH2 predicts a poor prognosis. Higher expression of FTO
is related to higher International Staging System (ISS) stage and higher
Revised-ISS (R-ISS) stage of MM. Collectively, our studies reveal that IDH2
regulates global m6A RNA modification in MM via targeting RNA demethylases FTO.
The imbalance of m6A methylation activates the Wnt signaling pathway by enhancing
the WNT7B expression, and thus promoting tumorigenesis and progression of MM.
IDH2 might be used as a therapeutic target and a possible prognostic factor for
MM.

The inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes contributes heavily to oncogenesis.
The mutation of TP53 has been well-studied and recognized as a major factor in
the development of tumors. Yet other means of p53 inactivation has not been
well-elucidated. We previously identified a hypermethylated gene ZDHHC1 that
suppresses tumor growth when the expression was restored, but the specific
mechanism was yet to be found. The protein product of ZDHHC1 is an
S-palmitoyltransferase and we have identified p53 as a substrate for
ZDHHC1-mediated palmitoylation, specifically at the C135, C176, and C275
residues. The novel form of post-translational modification of p53 is required
for the nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor. p53 recruited DNMT3A to
ZDHHC1 promoter and is responsible for the hypermethylation of ZDHHC1. The
epigenetic feedback loop formed by ZDHHC1 and p53 sheds light on the inactivation
of p53 without the presence of genetic mutations.

K-RAS mutation and molecular alterations of its surrogates function essentially
in lung tumorigenesis and malignant progression. However, it remains elusive how 
tumor-promoting and deleterious events downstream of K-RAS signaling are
coordinated in lung tumorigenesis. Here, we show that USP16, a deubiquitinase
involved in various biological processes, functions as a promoter for the
development of K-RAS-driven lung tumor. Usp16 deletion significantly attenuates
K-rasG12D-mutation-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. USP16 upregulation upon
RAS activation averts reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced p38 activation that
would otherwise detrimentally influence the survival and proliferation of tumor
cells. In addition, USP16 interacts with and deubiquitinates JAK1, and thereby
promoting lung tumor growth by augmenting JAK1 signaling. Therefore, our results 
reveal that USP16 functions critically in the K-RAS-driven lung tumorigenesis
through modulating the strength of p38 and JAK1 signaling.

The ARID1A gene, which encodes a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
complex, has been found to be frequently mutated in many human cancer types.
However, the function and mechanism of ARID1A in cancer metastasis are still
unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of ARID1A increases the ability of breast
cancer cells to proliferate, migrate, invade, and metastasize in vivo. The
ARID1A-related SWI/SNF complex binds to the second exon of CDH1 and negatively
modulates the expression of E-cadherin/CDH1 by recruiting the transcriptional
repressor ZEB2 to the CDH1 promoter and excluding the presence of RNA polymerase 
II. The silencing of CDH1 attenuated the migration, invasion, and metastasis of
breast cancer cells in which ARID1A was silenced. ARID1A depletion increased the 
intracellular enzymatic processing of E-cadherin and the production of C-terminal
fragment 2 (CTF2) of E-cadherin, which stabilized β-catenin by competing for
binding to the phosphorylation and degradation complex of β-catenin. The matrix
metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 inhibited the production of CTF2. In zebrafish
and nude mice, ARID1A silencing or CTF2 overexpression activated β-catenin
signaling and promoted migration/invasion and metastasis of cancer cells in vivo.
The inhibitors GM6001, BB94, and ICG-001 suppressed the migration and invasion of
cancer cells with ARID1A-deficiency. Our findings provide novel insights into the
mechanism of ARID1A metastasis and offer a scientific basis for targeted therapy 
of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells.

Research has indicated that hypoxia profoundly contributes to chemoresistance of 
pancreatic cancer (PC), while the precise mechanism has not been fully
elucidated. In this study, we report a hypoxic exosomal circular RNA
(circRNA)-mediated mechanism of conferred chemoresistance in PC cells.
Gemcitabine (GEM) resistance was enhanced in normoxic PC cells incubated with
exosomes derived from hypoxic PC cells. CircRNA microarray displayed that
circZNF91 was remarkably increased in hypoxic exosomes of PC cells compared with 
normoxic exosomes. Overexpression of circZNF91 obviously stimulated
chemoresistance in PC cells, while knockdown of circZNF91 retarded the hypoxic
exosome-transmitted chemoresistance. Mechanistically, the hypoxic-induced
exosomal circZNF91 transmitted into normoxic PC cells could competitively bind to
miR-23b-3p, which deprives the inhibition of miR-23b-3p on expression of
deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Consequently, the upregulated SIRT1 enhanced
deacetylation-dependent stability of HIF-1α protein, leading to glycolysis and
GEM chemoresistance of recipient PC cells. In addition, we revealed that the
increased circZNF91 in hypoxic exosome was attributed to the transcriptional
regulation by HIF-1α. Coincidently, transmission of hypoxic exosomes into
subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice obviously facilitated the chemoresistance of
transplanted PC tumor, which could be reversed by depletion of circZNF91 or
upregulation of miR-23b-3p. Furthermore, clinical data showed that circZNF91 was 
significantly upregulated in PC tissues and correlated with overexpression of
glycolytic enzymes and short overall survival time. Collectively, exosomal
circZNF91 can function as a cargo mediating the signal transmission between
hypoxic and normoxic tumor cells to promote GEM chemoresistance of PC and may
potentially serve as a therapeutic target.

B-Myb is an important transcription factor that plays a critical role in gene
expression regulation and tumorigenesis. However, its functional implication in
colorectal cancer remains elusive. In this study, we found that B-Myb was
significantly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in colorectal cancer
samples compared to non-tumor counterparts. B-Myb overexpression accelerated cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell motility in colorectal cancer
cells, and promoted tumor growth in orthotopic nude mouse models in vivo. In
contrast, B-Myb depletion inhibited these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that E2F2 was a novel transcriptional target of B-Myb and
is essential to B-Myb-induced malignant phenotypes. Notably, B-Myb and E2F2
exhibited positive expression correlation, and interacted with each other in
colorectal cancer cells. In addition to their autoregulatory mechanisms, B-Myb
and E2F2 can also directly transactivate each other, thus constituting
consolidated reciprocal feed-forward transactivation loops. Moreover, both B-Myb 
and E2F2 are required for the activation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways in
colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, our data clarified a critical role for
B-Myb in colorectal cancer and unraveled an exquisite mutual collaboration and
reciprocal cross regulation between B-Myb and E2F2 that contribute to the
malignant progression of human colorectal cancer.

We identified fermitin family member 2 (FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2) as a
potential target in A375 cell line by siRNA library screening. Drugs that target 
mutant BRAF kinase lack durable efficacy in the treatment of melanoma because of 
acquired resistance, thus the identification of novel therapeutic targets is
needed. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify kindlin-2 expression in
melanoma samples. The interaction between kindlin-2 and Rac1 or p-Rac/Cdc42
guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6 (α-Pix) was investigated. Finally, the tumor
suppressive role of kindlin-2 was validated in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of
clinical samples and Oncomine data showed that higher levels of kindlin-2
predicted a more advanced T stage and M stage and facilitated metastasis and
recurrence. Kindlin-2 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma growth and
migration, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression had the inverse effects. Further
study showed that kindlin-2 could specifically bind to p-α-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to
induce a switch from the inactive Rac1-GDP conformation to the active Rac1-GTP
conformation and then stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Moreover, we
revealed that a Rac1 inhibitor suppressed melanoma growth and metastasis and the 
combination of the Rac1 inhibitor and vemurafenib resulted in a better
therapeutic outcome than monotherapy in melanoma with high kindlin-2 expression
and BRAF mutation. Our results demonstrated that kindlin-2 promoted melanoma
progression, which was attributed to specific binding to p-α-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to
stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Thus, kindlin-2 could be a potential
therapeutic target for treating melanoma.

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent epigenetic RNA modification and is
vital in regulating malignancies. The roles of m6A modifiers on noncoding RNAs
have not been fully investigated in esophageal cancer. By screening all m6A
modifiers, ALKBH5 was the most potent member related to patient outcomes and
suppressing esophageal cancer malignancy in cell and animal models. It
demethylated pri-miR-194-2 and inhibited miR-194-2 biogenesis through an
m6A/DGCR8-dependent manner. RAI1, previously considered as a circadian clock
transcriptional regulator, was the main target of miR-194-2. It enhanced
transcription of Hippo pathway upstream genes by binding to their 3'UTR and
suppressed YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. The ALKBH5/miR-194-2/RAI1 axis was also
validated in clinical samples. In addition, the increased malignancy by low
ALKBH5 was abolished by the YAP inhibitor verteporfin. Our findings uncover a
critical role of ALKBH5 in miRNAs biogenesis and provide novel insight for
developing treatment strategies in esophageal cancer.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to exert important roles in
tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). PVT1 is an important
oncogenic lncRNA which has critical effects on onset and development of various
cancers, however, the underlying mechanism of PVT1 functioning in ccRCC remains
largely unknown. VHL deficiency-induced HIF2α accumulation is one of the major
factors for ccRCC. Here, we identified the potential molecular mechanism of PVT1 
in promoting ccRCC development by stabilizing HIF2α. PVT1 was significantly
upregulated in ccRCC tissues and high PVT1 expression was associated with poor
prognosis of ccRCC patients. Both gain-of-function and loss-of function
experiments revealed that PVT1 enhanced ccRCC cells proliferation, migration, and
invasion and induced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
PVT1 interacted with HIF2α protein and enhanced its stability by protecting it
from ubiquitination-dependent degradation, thereby exerting its biological
significance. Meanwhile, HIF2α bound to the enhancer of PVT1 to transactivate its
expression. Furthermore, HIF2α specific inhibitor could repress PVT1 expression
and its oncogenic functions. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the PVT1/
HIF2α positive feedback loop involves in tumorigenesis and progression of ccRCC, 
which may be exploited for anticancer therapy.

We have previously reported that the differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1), a
compound identified in Dictyostelium discoideum, suppresses the growth of MCF-7
breast cancer cells by inactivating p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K).
Therefore, we first examined whether the same mechanism operates in other breast 
cancer cells, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most
aggressive and refractory phenotype of breast cancer. We also investigated the
mechanism by which DIF-1 suppresses p70S6K by focusing on the AMPK-mTORC1 system.
We found that DIF-1 induces phosphorylation of AMPK and Raptor and
dephosphorylation of p70S6K in multiple TNBC cell lines. Next, we examined
whether AMPK-mediated inhibition of p70S6K leads to the suppression of
proliferation and migration/infiltration of TNBC cells. DIF-1 significantly
reduced the expression levels of cyclin D1 by suppressing the translation of
STAT3 and strongly suppressed the expression levels of Snail, which led to the
suppression of growth and motility, respectively. Finally, we investigated
whether DIF-1 exerts anticancer effects on TNBC in vivo. Intragastric
administration of DIF-1 suppressed tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis
of 4T1-Luc cells injected into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. DIF-1 is
expected to lead to the development of anticancer drugs, including anti-TNBC, by 
a novel mechanism.

Metastatic breast cancer causes most breast cancer-associated deaths, especially 
in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). The metastatic drivers of TNBCs are
still poorly understood, and effective treatment non-existent. Here we reveal
that the presence of Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA) in the nucleus and metastatic
dissemination are molecularly connected through HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1)
signaling. Nuclear AURKA activates transcription of "hypoxia-induced genes" under
normoxic conditions (pseudohypoxia) and without upregulation of oxygen-sensitive 
HIF1A subunit. We uncover that AURKA preferentially binds to HIF1B and
co-localizes with the HIF complex on DNA. The mass-spectrometry analysis of the
AURKA complex further confirmed the presence of CBP and p300 along with other
TFIIB/RNApol II components. Importantly, the expression of multiple HIF-dependent
genes induced by nuclear AURKA (N-AURKA), including migration/invasion,
survival/death, and stemness, promote early cancer dissemination. These results
indicate that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, AURKA is a novel driver of early
metastasis. Analysis of clinical tumor specimens revealed a correlation between
N-AURKA presence and decreased patient survival. Our results establish a
mechanistic link between two critical pathways in cancer metastasis, identifying 
nuclear AURKA as a crucial upstream regulator of the HIF1 transcription complex
and a target for anti-metastatic therapy.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths primarily
due to its inherent potential of therapy resistance. Checkpoint inhibitors have
emerged as promising anti-cancer agents when used in combination with
conventional anti-cancer therapies. Recent studies have highlighted a critical
role of the Greatwall kinase (microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein
kinase-like (MASTL)) in promoting oncogenic malignancy and resistance to
anti-cancer therapies; however, its role in PC remains unknown. Based on a
comprehensive investigation involving PC patient samples, murine models of PC
progression (Kras;PdxCre-KC and Kras;p53;PdxCre-KPC), and loss and gain of
function studies, we report a previously undescribed critical role of MASTL in
promoting cancer malignancy and therapy resistance. Mechanistically, MASTL
promotes PC by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor protein stability 
and, thereupon, kinase signaling. We further demonstrate that combinatorial
therapy targeting MASTL promotes the efficacy of the cell-killing effects of
Gemcitabine using both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions. Taken together,
this study identifies a key role of MASTL in promoting PC progression and its
utility as a novel target in promoting sensitivity to the anti-PC therapies.

Cancer cells exhibit dysregulation of critical genes including those involved in 
lipid biosynthesis, with subsequent defects in metabolism. Here, we show that
ELOngation of Very Long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), a rate-limiting
enzyme in the biosynthesis of very-long polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3, ≥28 C),
is expressed and transcriptionally repressed by the oncogene MYCN in
neuroblastoma cells. In keeping, ELOVL4 positively regulates neuronal
differentiation and lipids droplets accumulation in neuroblastoma cells. At the
molecular level we found that MYCN binds to the promoter of ELOVL4 in close
proximity to the histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2, and the transcription factor 
Sp1 that can cooperate in the repression of ELOVL4 expression. Accordingly, in
vitro differentiation results in an increase of fatty acid with 34 carbons with 6
double bonds (FA34:6); and when MYCN is silenced, FA34:6 metabolite is increased 
compared with the scrambled. In addition, analysis of large neuroblastoma
datasets revealed that ELOVL4 expression is highly expressed in localized
clinical stages 1 and 2, and low in high-risk stages 3 and 4. More importantly,
high expression of ELOVL4 stratifies a subsets of neuroblastoma patients with
good prognosis. Indeed, ELOVL4 expression is a marker of better overall clinical 
survival also in MYCN not amplified patients and in those with
neuroblastoma-associated mutations. In summary, our findings indicate that MYCN, 
by repressing the expression of ELOVL4 and lipid metabolism, contributes to the
progression of neuroblastoma.

Metastatic recurrence is still a major challenge in breast cancer treatment, but 
the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that a small adaptor
protein, SH3BGRL, is upregulated in the majority of breast cancer patients,
especially elevated in those with metastatic relapse, indicating it as a marker
for the poor prognosis of breast cancer. Physiologically, SH3BGRL can
multifunctionally promote breast cancer cell tumorigenicity, migration,
invasiveness, and efficient lung colonization in nude mice. Mechanistically,
SH3BGRL downregulates the acting-binding protein profilin 1 (PFN1) by
accelerating the translation of the PFN1 E3 ligase, STUB1 via SH3BGRL interaction
with ribosomal proteins, or/and enhancing the interaction of PFN1 with STUB1 to
accelerate PFN1 degradation. Loss of PFN1 consequently contributes to downstream 
multiple activations of AKT, NF-kB, and WNT signaling pathways. In contrast, the 
forced expression of compensatory PFN1 in SH3BGRL-high cells efficiently
neutralizes SH3BGRL-induced metastasis and tumorigenesis with PTEN upregulation
and PI3K-AKT signaling inactivation. Clinical analysis validates that SH3BGRL
expression is negatively correlated with PFN1 and PTEN levels, but positively to 
the activations of AKT, NF-kB, and WNT signaling pathways in breast patient
tissues. Our results thus suggest that SH3BGRL is a valuable prognostic factor
and a potential therapeutic target for preventing breast cancer progression and
metastasis.

Anoikis is a type of programmed cell death induced by loss of anchorage to the
extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis resistance (AR) is crucial for the survival
of metastatic cancer cells in blood, lymphatic circulation and distant organs.
Compared to ordinary cancer cells, anoikis resistant cancer cells undergo various
cellular and molecular alterations, probably characterizing the cells with unique
features not limited to anoikis resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms
connecting anoikis resistance to other metastatic properties are still poorly
understood. Here, the biological interaction between anoikis resistance and
angiogenesis as well as their involvement into peritoneal metastasis of gastric
cancer (GC) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The prognostic value of key
components involved in this interaction was evaluated in the GC cohort. Compared 
to ordinary GC cells, GCAR cells exhibited stronger metastatic and pro-angiogenic
traits corresponding to elevated PDGFB secretion. Mechanistically, transcription 
factor C/EBPβ facilitated PDGFB transcription by directly binding to and
interacting with PDGFB promoter elements, subsequently increasing PDGFB
secretion. Secreted PDGFB promoted the survival of detached GC cells through a
C/EBPβ-dependent self-feedback loop. Moreover, secreted PDGFB promoted
angiogenesis in metastases via activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in
vascular endothelial cells. Both C/EBPβ activation level and PDGFB expression
were significantly elevated in GC and correlated with metastatic progression and 
poor prognosis of patients with GC. Overall, interaction between GCAR cells and
vascular endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis and peritoneal metastasis of GC 
based on C/EBPβ-mediated PDGFB autocrine and paracrine signaling.
C/EBPβ-PDGFB-PDGFRβ-MAPK axis promises to be potential prognostic biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for peritoneal metastasis of GC.

Expression of β-crystallin B2 (CRYβB2) is elevated in African American (AA)
breast tumors. The underlying mechanisms of CRYβB2-induced malignancy and the
association of CRYβB2 protein expression with survival have not yet been
described. Here, we report that the expression of CRYβB2 in breast cancer cells
increases stemness, growth, and metastasis. Transcriptomics data revealed that
CRYβB2 upregulates genes that are functionally associated with unfolded protein
response, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA repair, while down-regulating genes 
related to apoptosis. CRYβB2 in tumors promotes de-differentiation, an increase
in mesenchymal markers and cancer-associated fibroblasts, and enlargement of
nucleoli. Proteome microarrays identified a direct interaction between CRYβB2 and
the nucleolar protein, nucleolin. CRYβB2 induces nucleolin, leading to the
activation of AKT and EGFR signaling. CRISPR studies revealed a dependency on
nucleolin for the pro-tumorigenic effects of CRYβB2. Triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) xenografts with upregulated CRYβB2 are distinctively sensitive to
the nucleolin aptamer, AS-1411. Lastly, in AA patients, higher levels of
nucleolar CRYβB2 in primary TNBC correlates with decreased survival. In summary, 
CRYβB2 is upregulated in breast tumors of AA patients and induces oncogenic
alterations consistent with an aggressive cancer phenotype. CRYβB2 increases
sensitivity to nucleolin inhibitors and may promote breast cancer disparity.

RING finger proteins (RNFs) play a critical role in cancer initiation and
progression. RNF141 is a member of RNFs family; however, its clinical
significance, roles, and mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly
understood. Here, we examined the expression of RNF141 in 64 pairs of CRC and
adjacent normal tissues by real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical
analysis. We found that there was more expression of RNF141 in CRC tissue
compared with its adjacent normal tissue and high RNF141 expression associated
with T stage. In vivo and in vitro functional experiments were conducted and
revealed the oncogenic role of RNF141 in CRC. RNF141 knockdown suppressed
proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase, inhibited migration,
invasion and HUVEC tube formation but promoted apoptosis, whereas RNF141
overexpression exerted the opposite effects in CRC cells. The subcutaneous
xenograft models showed that RNF141 knockdown reduced tumor growth, but its
overexpression promoted tumor growth. Mechanistically, liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry indicated RNF141 interacted with KRAS,
which was confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence assay. Further 
analysis with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and
Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays showed that RNF141 could
directly bind to KRAS. Importantly, the upregulation of RNF141 increased
GTP-bound KRAS, but its knockdown resulted in a reduction accordingly. Next, we
demonstrated that RNF141 induced KRAS activation via increasing its enrichment on
the plasma membrane not altering total KRAS expression, which was facilitated by 
the interaction with LYPLA1. Moreover, KRAS silencing partially abolished the
effect of RNF141 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, our findings
presented that RNF141 functioned as an oncogene by upregulating KRAS activity in 
a manner of promoting KRAS enrichment on the plasma membrane in CRC.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide.
Though advances in diagnosis and treatment have prolonged overall survival (OS)
for patients with breast cancer, metastasis remains the major obstacles to
improved survival for breast cancer patients. The existence of breast cancer stem
cells (BCSCs) is a major reason underlying cancer metastasis and recurrence.
Therefore, understanding the molecular pathways sustaining BCSC properties and
targeting BCSCs will ultimately improve breast cancer treatments. In this study, 
we found that activation of β-Catenin directly regulated CCL2 expression at the
transcriptional level, and in turn promoted macrophages infiltration and M2
polarization. Moreover, macrophages co-cultured with breast cancer cells showed a
significant increase in CCL2 expression and promoted β-Catenin-induced BCSCs
properties, whereas depletion of CCL2 by adding neutralizing antibodies
suppressed BSCSs properties. In addition, we found that β-Catenin-mediated CCL2
secretion recruited macrophages into tumor microenvironment and promoted breast
cancer growth and metastasis in vivo. Clinically, we observed a significant
positive correlation between β-Catenin, CCL2 and CD163 expression, and increased 
expression of β-Catenin, CCL2 and CD163 predicted poor prognosis in breast
cancer. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 and β-Catenin
synergistically suppressed BCSC properties and breast cancer growth.
Collectively, our findings suggested that β-Catenin-mediated CCL2 secretion forms
a paracrine feedback loop between breast cancer cells and macrophages, which in
turn promotes BCSC properties and supports breast cancer growth and metastasis.
Targeting β-Catenin/CCL2 signaling might be an effective strategy for breast
cancer therapy.

Emerging evidence suggests that the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key culprits of 
cancer metastasis and drug resistance. Understanding mechanisms regulating the
critical oncogenic pathways and CSCs function could reveal new diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies. We now report that miR-22, a miRNA critical for hair
follicle stem/progenitor cell differentiation, promotes tumor initiation,
progression, and metastasis by maintaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling and CSCs
function. Mechanistically, we find that miR-22 facilitates β-catenin
stabilization through directly repressing citrullinase PAD2. Moreover, miR-22
also relieves DKK1-mediated repression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by targeting a 
FosB-DDK1 transcriptional axis. miR-22 knockout mice showed attenuated
Wnt/β-catenin activity and Lgr5+ CSCs penetrance, resulting in reduced
occurrence, progression, and metastasis of chemically induced cutaneous squamous 
cell carcinoma (cSCC). Clinically, miR-22 is abundantly expressed in human cSCC. 
Its expression is even further elevated in the CSCs proportion, which negatively 
correlates with PAD2 and FosB expression. Inhibition of miR-22 markedly
suppressed cSCC progression and increased chemotherapy sensitivity in vitro and

regulatory mechanism in cSCC and highlight the important clinical application
prospects of miR-22, a common target molecule for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and
CSCs, for patient stratification and therapeutic intervention.

Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is a tumor suppressor downregulated in 
hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, two of the fastest rising
cancers worldwide. We compared MATα1 (protein encoded by MAT1A) interactome in
normal versus cancerous livers by mass spectrometry to reveal interactions with
14-3-3ζ. The MATα1/14-3-3ζ complex was critical for the expression of 14-3-3ζ.
Similarly, the knockdown and small molecule inhibitor for 14-3-3ζ (BV02), and
ChIP analysis demonstrated the role of 14-3-3ζ in suppressing MAT1A expression.
Interaction between MATα1 and 14-3-3ζ occurs directly and is enhanced by AKT2
phosphorylation of MATα1. Blocking their interaction enabled nuclear MATα1
translocation and inhibited tumorigenesis. In contrast, overexpressing 14-3-3ζ
lowered nuclear MATα1 levels and promoted tumor progression. However,
tumor-promoting effects of 14-3-3ζ were eliminated when liver cancer cells
expressed mutant MATα1 unable to interact with 14-3-3ζ. Taken together, the
reciprocal negative regulation that MATα1 and 14-3-3ζ exert is a key mechanism in
liver tumorigenesis.

5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is a posttranscriptional RNA modification participating in
many critical bioprocesses, but its functions in human cancer remain unclear.
Here, by detecting the transcriptome-wide m5C profiling in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC), we showed increased m5C methylation in ESCC tumors due to 
the overexpressed m5C methyltransferase NSUN2. Aberrant expression of NSUN2 was
positively regulated by E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1). High NSUN2 levels
predicted poor survival of ESCC patients. Moreover, silencing NSUN2 suppressed
ESCC tumorigenesis and progression in Nsun2 knockout mouse models.
Mechanistically, NSUN2 induced m5C modification of growth factor receptor-bound
protein 2 (GRB2) and stabilized its mRNA, which was mediated by a novel m5C
mediator, protein lin-28 homolog B (LIN28B). Elevated GRB2 levels increased the
activation of PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signalling. These results demonstrate that
NSUN2 enhances the initiation and progression of ESCC via m5C-LIN28B dependent
stabilization of GRB2 transcript, providing a promising
epitranscriptomic-targeted therapeutic strategy for ESCC.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis
and an important tumor suppressor in human malignancies. Here, we aimed to
investigate the expression profile of FBP1 in ovarian cancer, the molecular
mechanisms that regulate FBP1 expression and to examine how the FBP1 regulatory
axis contributes to tumorigenesis and progression in ovarian cancer. We showed
that FBP1 expression was significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues
compared with normal ovarian tissues, and low-FBP1 expression predicted poor
prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. The enhanced expression of FBP1 in
ovarian cancer cell lines suppressed proliferation and 2-D/3-D invasion, reduced 
aerobic glycolysis, and sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, DNA methylation and C-MYC binding at the promoter inhibited FBP1
expression. Furthermore, through physical interactions with signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), FBP1 suppressed nuclear translocation of
STAT3 and exerted its non-metabolic enzymatic activity to induce the dysfunction 
of STAT3. Thus, our study suggests that FBP1 may be a valuable prognostic
predictor for ovarian cancer. C-MYC-dependent downregulation of FBP1 acted as a
tumor suppressor via modulating STAT3, and the C-MYC/FBP1/STAT3 axis could be a
therapeutic target.

The activity of Rho family GTPase protein, RAC1, which plays important normal
physiological functions, is dysregulated in multiple cancers. RAC1 is expressed
in both estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer (BC) 
cells. However, ER-positive BC is more sensitive to RAC1 inhibition. We have
determined that reducing RAC1 activity, using siRNA or EHT 1864 (a small molecule
Rac inhibitor), leads to rapid ER protein degradation. RAC1 interacts with ER
within the ER complex and RAC1 localizes to chromatin binding sites for ER upon
estrogen treatment. RAC1 activity is important for RNA Pol II function at both
promoters and enhancers of ER target genes and ER-regulated gene transcription is
blocked by EHT 1864, in a dose-dependent manner. Having identified that RAC1 is
an essential ER cofactor for ER protein stability and ER transcriptional
activity, we report that RAC1 inhibition could be an effective therapeutic
approach for ER-positive BC.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and extremely aggressive type of
thyroid cancer, and the potential mechanisms involved in ATC progression remains 
unclarified. In this study, we found that forkhead box K2 (FOXK2) was upregulated
in ATC tissues, and the expression of FOXK2 was associated with tumor size.
Evidenced by RNA-seq and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq assays, FOXK2
positively regulated VEGF and VEGFR signaling network, among which only VEGFA
could be noticed in both RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results. ChIP, dual-luciferase
reporter system and functional experiments further confirmed that FOXK2 promoted 
angiogenesis by inducing the transcription of VEGFA. On VEGFR2 blockage by
specific targeting agent, such as Apatinib, FOXK2 could rapidly trigger
therapeutic resistance. Mechanical analyses revealed that VEGFA transcriptionally
induced by FOXK2 could bind to VEGFR1 as a compensation for VEGFR2 blockage,
which promoted angiogenesis by activating ERK, PI3K/AKT and P38/MAPK signaling in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Synergic effect on
anti-angiogenesis could be observed when VEGFR1 suppressor AF321 was included in 
VEGFR2 inhibition system, which clarified the pivot role of FOXK2 in VEGFR2
targeting therapy resistance. More importantly, the binding of VEGFA to VEGFR1
could further promoter FOXK2-mediated VEGFA transcription, which consequently
constituted a positive feedback loop. Therefore, the novel loop
VEGFA/VEGFR1/FOXK2 functioned importantly in resistance to VEGFR2 targeting
therapy in FOXK2+ ATCs. Altogether, FOXK2 plays critical roles in ATC
angiogenesis and VEGFR2 blockage resistance by inducing VEGFA transcription.
FOXK2 represents a potentially new therapeutic strategy and biomarker for
anti-angiogenic therapy against ATC.

The PBAF complex, a member of SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, plays an
essential role in transcriptional regulation. We revealed a disease progression
associated elevation of PHF10 subunit of PBAF in clinical melanoma samples. In
melanoma cell lines, PHF10 interacts with MYC and facilitates the recruitment of 
PBAF complex to target gene promoters, therefore, augmenting MYC transcriptional 
activation of genes involved in the cell cycle progression. Depletion of either
PHF10 or MYC induced G1 accumulation and a senescence-like phenotype. Our data
identify PHF10 as a pro-oncogenic mechanism and an essential novel link between
chromatin remodeling and MYC-dependent gene transcription.

MAP4K4 is a Ste20 member and reported to play important roles in various
pathologies, including in cancer. However, the mechanism by which MAP4K4 promotes
pancreatic cancer is not fully understood. It is suggested that MAP4K4 might
function as a cancer promoter via specific downstream target(s) in an
organ-specific manner. Here we identified MLK3 as a direct downstream target of
MAP4K4. The MAP4K4 and MLK3 associates with each other, and MAP4K4 phosphorylates
MLK3 on Thr738 and increases MLK3 kinase activity and downstream signaling. The
phosphorylation of MLK3 by MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, 
migration, and colony formation. Moreover, MAP4K4 is overexpressed in human
pancreatic tumors and directly correlates with the disease progression. The
MAP4K4-specific pharmacological inhibitor, GNE-495, impedes pancreatic cancer
cell growth, migration, induces cell death, and arrests cell cycle progression.
Additionally, the GNE-495 reduced the tumor burden and extended survival of the
KPC mice with pancreatic cancer. The MAP4K4 inhibitor also reduced MAP4K4 protein
expression, tumor stroma, and induced cell death in murine pancreatic tumors.
These findings collectively suggest that MLK3 phosphorylation by MAP4K4 promotes 
pancreatic cancer, and therefore therapies targeting MAP4K4 might alleviate the
pancreatic cancer tumor burden in patients.

Liver metastasis (LM) severely affects gastric cancer (GC) patients' prognosis.
Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play key roles in intercellular
communication. Specific sEV-miRNAs from several types of cancer were found to
induce a premetastatic niche in target organs before tumor cell arrive. However, 
whether the primary GC affects hepatic microenvironment or the role of sEV-miRNAs
in GC-LM is yet unclear. We report that GC-derived sEVs are primarily absorbed by
Kupffer cells (KCs). sEV-miR-151a-3p is highly expressed in GC-LM patients'
plasma and presents poor prognosis. Treating mice with sEVs-enriched in
miR-151a-3p promotes GC-LM, whereas has no influence on the proliferation of GC
cells in situ. Mechanistically, sEV-miR-151a-3p inhibits SP3 in KCs.
Simultaneously, sEV-miR-151a-3p targets YTHDF3 to decrease the transcriptional
inhibitory activity of SP3 by reducing SUMO1 translation in a
N6-methyladenosine-dependent manner. These factors contribute to TGF-β1
transactivation in KCs, subsequently activating the SMAD2/3 pathway and enhancing
the stem cell-like properties of incoming GC cells. Furthermore, sEV-miR-151a-3p 
induces miR-151a-3p transcription in KCs to form a positive feedback loop. In
summary, our results reveal a previously unidentified regulatory axis initiated
by sEV-miR-151a-3p that establishes a hepatic stemness-permissive niche to
support GC-LM. sEV-miR-151a-3p could be a promising diagnostic biomarker and
preventive treatment candidate for GC-LM.

High rates of glycolysis in cancer cells are a well-established characteristic of
many human tumors, providing rapidly proliferating cancer cells with metabolites 
that can be used as precursors for anabolic pathways. Maintenance of high
glycolytic rates depends on the lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed regeneration of
NAD+ from GAPDH-generated NADH because an increased NADH:NAD+ ratio inhibits
GAPDH. Here, using human breast cancer cell models, we identified a pathway in
which changes in the extramitochondrial-free NADH:NAD+ ratio signaled through the
CtBP family of NADH-sensitive transcriptional regulators to control the abundance
and activity of p53. NADH-free forms of CtBPs cooperated with the p53-binding
partner HDM2 to suppress p53 function, and loss of these forms in highly
glycolytic cells resulted in p53 accumulation. We propose that this pathway
represents a "glycolytic stress response" in which the initiation of a protective
p53 response by an increased NADH:NAD+ ratio enables cells to avoid cellular
damage caused by mismatches between metabolic supply and demand.

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that
dictates whether cells survive or die in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) and other inflammatory stimuli. The activity of RIPK1 is tightly
controlled by multiple posttranslational modification mechanisms, including
ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Here, we report that sensitivity to
TNF-induced, RIPK1-dependent cell death was tunable by the pH environment. We
found that an acidic extracellular pH, which led to a concomitant decrease in
intracellular pH, impaired the kinase activation of RIPK1 and autophosphorylation
at Ser166 Consequently, formation of the cytosolic death-inducing complex II and 
subsequent RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis were inhibited. By contrast,
low pH did not affect the formation of membrane-anchored TNFR1-containing
signaling complex (complex I), RIPK1 ubiquitination, and NF-κB activation.
TNF-induced cell death in Ripk1 -/- cells was not sensitive to pH changes.
Furthermore, mutation of the conserved His151 abolished the pH dependence of
RIPK1 activation, suggesting that this histidine residue functions as a proton
acceptor to modulate RIPK1 activity in response to pH changes. These results
revealed an unexpected environmental factor that controls the death-inducing
activity of RIPK1.

The suppression of bone formation is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Myeloma
cells inhibit osteoblastogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can
also differentiate into adipocytes. We investigated myeloma-MSC interactions and 
the effects of such interactions on the differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes
or osteoblasts using single-cell RNA sequencing, in vitro coculture, and
subcutaneous injection of MSCs and myeloma cells into mice. Our results revealed 
that the α4 integrin subunit on myeloma cells stimulated vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM1) on MSCs, leading to the activation of protein kinase C β1
(PKCβ1) signaling and repression of the muscle ring-finger protein-1
(MURF1)-mediated ubiquitylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 
(PPARγ2). Stabilized PPARγ2 proteins enhanced adipogenesis and consequently
reduced osteoblastogenesis from MSCs, thus suppressing bone formation in vitro
and in vivo. These findings reveal that suppressed bone formation is a direct
consequence of myeloma-MSC contact that promotes the differentiation of MSCs into
adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts. Thus, this study provides a potential
strategy for treating bone resorption in patients with myeloma by counteracting
tumor-MSC interactions.

N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (NMDARs) containing GluN2B
subunits are prevalent early after birth in most brain regions in rodents. Upon
synapse maturation, GluN2B is progressively removed from synapses, which affects 
NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity. Aberrant recruitment of GluN2B into
mature synapses has been implicated in several neuropathologies that afflict
adults. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b was enriched in the spinal
cord dorsal horn neurons of mice and rats and suppressed GluN2B abundance during 
development and inflammatory pain. Cbl-b abundance increased from postnatal day 1
(P1) to P14, a critical time period for synapse maturation. Through its
N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, Cbl-b interacted with GluN2B.
Ubiquitination of GluN2B by Cbl-b decreased the synaptic transmission mediated by
GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Knocking down Cbl-b in vivo during P1 to P14 led to
sustained retention of GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses, suggesting that Cbl-b
limits the synaptic abundance of GluN2B in adult mice. However, peripheral
inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant
resulted in the dephosphorylation of Cbl-b at Tyr363, which impaired its binding 
to and ubiquitylation of GluN2B, enabling the reappearance of GluN2B-containing
NMDARs at synapses. Expression of a phosphomimic Cbl-b mutant in the dorsal horn 
suppressed both GluN2B-mediated synaptic currents and manifestations of pain
induced by inflammation. The findings indicate a ubiquitin-mediated developmental
switch in NMDAR subunit composition that is dysregulated by inflammation, which
can enhance nociception.

Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) is an important metalloproteinase that
synchronizes growth factor activation with extracellular matrix assembly during
morphogenesis and tissue repair. The mechanisms by which BMP-1 exerts these
effects are highly context dependent. Because BMP-1 overexpression induces marked
phenotypic changes in two human cell lines (HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells), we
investigated how BMP-1 simultaneously affects cell-matrix interactions and growth
factor activity in these cells. Increasing BMP-1 led to a loss of cell adhesion
that depended on the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). BMP-1
cleaved TSP-1 between the VWFC/procollagen-like domain and the type 1 repeats
that mediate several key TSP-1 functions. This cleavage induced the release of
TSP-1 C-terminal domains from the extracellular matrix and abolished its
previously described multisite cooperative interactions with heparan sulfate
proteoglycans and CD36 on HT1080 cells. In addition, BMP-1-dependent proteolysis 
potentiated the TSP-1-mediated activation of latent transforming growth factor-β 
(TGF-β), leading to increased signaling through the canonical SMAD pathway. In
primary human corneal stromal cells (keratocytes), endogenous BMP-1 cleaved
TSP-1, and the addition of exogenous BMP-1 enhanced cleavage, but this had no
substantial effect on cell adhesion. Instead, processed TSP-1 promoted the
differentiation of keratocytes into myofibroblasts and stimulated production of
the myofibroblast marker α-SMA, consistent with the presence of processed TSP-1
in human corneal scars. Our results indicate that BMP-1 can both trigger the
disruption of cell adhesion and stimulate TGF-β signaling in TSP-1-rich
microenvironments, which has important potential consequences for wound healing
and tumor progression.

Mitochondria are signaling hubs in eukaryotic cells. Here, we showed that the
mitochondrial FUN14 domain-containing protein-1 (FUNDC1), an effector of
Parkin-independent mitophagy, also participates in cellular plasticity by
sustaining oxidative bioenergetics, buffering ROS production, and supporting cell
proliferation. Targeting this pathway in cancer cells suppressed tumor growth but
rendered transformed cells more motile and invasive in a manner dependent on
ROS-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial repositioning to the
cortical cytoskeleton. Global metabolomics and proteomics profiling identified a 
FUNDC1 interactome at the mitochondrial inner membrane, comprising the AAA+
protease, LonP1, and subunits of oxidative phosphorylation, complex V (ATP
synthase). Independently of its previously identified role in mitophagy, FUNDC1
enabled LonP1 proteostasis, which in turn preserved complex V function and
decreased ROS generation. Therefore, mitochondrial reprogramming by a
FUNDC1-LonP1 axis controls tumor cell plasticity by switching between
proliferative and invasive states in cancer.

Chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), notably the branch
comprising the kinase PERK and the translation initiation factor eIF2α, is a
pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein
misfolding. Partial reduction of UPR signaling at the level of phosphorylated
eIF2α is neuroprotective and avoids the pancreatic toxicity caused by full
inhibition of PERK kinase activity. However, other stress pathways besides the
UPR converge on phosphorylated eIF2α in the integrated stress response (ISR),
which is critical to normal cellular function. We explored whether partial
inhibition of PERK signaling may be a better therapeutic option. PERK-mediated
phosphorylation of eIF2α requires its binding to the insert loop within PERK's
kinase domain, which is, itself, phosphorylated at multiple sites. We found that,
as expected, Akt mediates the phosphorylation of Thr799 in PERK. This
phosphorylation event reduced eIF2α binding to PERK and selectively attenuated
downstream signaling independently of PERK activity and the broader ISR.
Induction of Thr799 phosphorylation with a small-molecule activator of Akt
similarly reduced PERK signaling and increased both neuronal and animal survival 
without measurable pancreatic toxicity in a mouse model of prion disease. Thus,
promoting PERK phosphorylation at Thr799 to partially down-regulate PERK-eIF2α
signaling while avoiding widespread ISR inhibition may be a safe therapeutic
approach in neurodegenerative disease.

Disruption of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway results in the transactivation of NRF2
target genes, consequently inducing cell proliferation and other phenotypic
changes in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that GULP1 was a KEAP1-binding
protein that maintained actin cytoskeleton architecture and helped KEAP1 to
sequester NRF2 in the cytoplasm. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB),
silencing of GULP1 facilitated the nuclear accumulation of NRF2, led to
constitutive activation of NRF2 signaling, and conferred resistance to the
platinum drug cisplatin. Knockdown of GULP1 in UCB cells promoted tumor cell
proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. In primary UCB, GULP1
silencing was more prevalent in muscle-invasive UCB compared to
nonmuscle-invasive UCB. GULP1 knockdown cells showed resistance to cisplatin
treatment. In parallel with decreased GULP1 expression, we observed increased
expression of NRF2, HMOX1, and other candidate antioxidant genes in
cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, low or no expression of GULP1 was
observed in most cisplatin nonresponder cases. Silencing of GULP1 was associated 
with GULP1 promoter hypermethylation in cell lines and primary tumors, and a high
frequency of GULP1 promoter methylation was observed in multiple sets of primary 
clinical UCB samples. Together, our findings demonstrate that GULP1 is a
KEAP1-binding protein that regulates KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in UCB and that
promoter hypermethylation of GULP1 is a potential mechanism of GULP1 silencing.

The cardiac membrane protein phospholamban (PLN) is targeted by protein kinase A 
(PKA) at Ser16 and by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at
Thr17 β-Adrenergic stimulation and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser16 acutely
stimulate the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) by relieving its
inhibition by PLN. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation may lead to longer-lasting
SERCA stimulation and may sustain maladaptive Ca2+ handling. Here, we
demonstrated that phosphorylation at either Ser16 or Thr17 converted PLN into a
target for the phosphoadaptor protein 14-3-3 with different affinities. 14-3-3
proteins were localized within nanometers of PLN and endogenous 14-3-3
coimmunoprecipitated with pentameric PLN from cardiac membranes. Molecular
dynamics simulations predicted different molecular contacts for peptides
phosphorylated at Ser16 or Thr17 with the binding groove of 14-3-3, resulting in 
varied binding affinities. 14-3-3 binding protected either PLN phosphosite from
dephosphorylation. β-Adrenergic stimulation of isolated adult cardiomyocytes
resulted in the membrane recruitment of endogenous 14-3-3. The exogenous addition
of 14-3-3 to β-adrenergic-stimulated cardiomyocytes led to prolonged SERCA
activation, presumably because 14-3-3 protected PLN pentamers from
dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser16 was disrupted by the
cardiomyopathy-associated ∆Arg14 mutation, implying that phosphorylation of Thr17
by CaMKII may become crucial for 14-3-3 recruitment to ∆Arg14 PLN. Consistent
with PLN acting as a dynamic hub in the control of Ca2+ handling, our results
identify 14-3-3 binding to PLN as a contractility-augmenting mechanism.

The reciprocal regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) by protein
kinases is essential to cell cycle progression and control, particularly during
mitosis for which the role of kinases has been extensively studied. PPPs perform 
much of the serine/threonine dephosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and achieve
substrate selectivity and specificity through the interaction of distinct
regulatory subunits with conserved catalytic subunits in holoenzyme complexes.
Using a mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approach to enrich, identify,
and quantify endogenous PPP holoenzyme complexes combined with kinase profiling, 
we investigated the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of PPP holoenzymes in
mitotic cells. We found that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylated a
threonine residue on the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, which
disrupted its holoenzyme formation with the regulatory subunit B55. The
consequent decrease in the dephosphorylation of PP2A-B55 substrates promoted
mitotic entry. This direct phosphorylation by CDK1 was in addition to a
previously reported indirect mechanism, thus adding a layer to the interaction
between CDK1 and PP2A in regulating mitotic entry.

The high abundance of drug efflux pumps in cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributes
to chemotherapy resistance. The transcriptional regulator SMAR1 suppresses CSC
expansion in colorectal cancer, and increased abundance of SMAR1 is associated
with better prognosis. Here, we found in breast tumors that the expression of
SMAR1 was decreased in CSCs through the cooperative interaction of the
pluripotency factors Oct4 and Sox2 with the histone deacetylase HDAC1.
Overexpressing SMAR1 sensitized CSCs to chemotherapy through SMAR1-dependent
recruitment of HDAC2 to the promoter of the gene encoding the drug efflux pump
ABCG2. Treating cultured CSCs or 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with the nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug aspirin restored SMAR1 expression and ABCG2 repression and
enhanced tumor sensitivity to doxorubicin. Our findings reveal transcriptional
mechanisms regulating SMAR1 that also regulate cancer stemness and
chemoresistance and suggest that, by restoring SMAR1 expression, aspirin might
enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with stem-like tumors.

The protein Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is frequently overexpressed at the transcript level
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes metastatic progression through the
induction of β-catenin, a Wnt signaling effector. We investigated how DKK1
expression is induced in HCC and found that activation of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) promoted parallel MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathway signaling
that converged to epigenetically stimulate DKK1 transcription. In HCC cell lines 
stimulated with EGF, EGFR-activated ERK phosphorylated the kinase PKM2 at Ser37, 
which promoted its nuclear translocation. Also in these cells, EGFR-activated Akt
phosphorylated the acetyltransferase p300 at Ser1834 Subsequently, PKM2 and p300 
mediated the phosphorylation and acetylation, respectively, of histone H3 at the 
DKK1 promoter, which synergistically enhanced DKK1 transcription. The mechanism
was supported with mutational analyses in cells and in a chemically induced HCC
model in rats. The findings suggest that dual inhibition of the MEK and PI3K
pathways might suppress the expression of DKK1 and, consequently, tumor
metastasis in patients with HCC.

LGR4 and LGR5 encode two homologous receptors with critical, yet distinct, roles 
in organ development and adult stem cell survival. Both receptors are coexpressed
in intestinal crypt stem cells, bind to R-spondins (RSPOs) with high affinity,
and potentiate Wnt-β-catenin signaling, presumably by the same mechanism: forming
RSPO-bridged complexes with the E3 ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3 to inhibit
ubiquitylation of Wnt receptors. However, direct evidence for RSPO-bound,
full-length LGR5 interacting with these E3 ligases in whole cells has not been
reported, and only LGR4 is essential for the self-renewal of intestinal stem
cells. Here, we examined the mechanisms of action of LGR4 and LGR5 in parallel
using coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation, competition binding, and
time-resolved FRET assays in whole cells. Full-length LGR4 formed a tight complex
with ZNRF3 and RNF43 even without RSPO, whereas LGR5 did not interact with either
E3 ligase with or without RSPO. Domain-swapping experiments with LGR4 and LGR5
revealed that the seven-transmembrane domain of LGR4 conferred interaction with
the E3 ligases. Native LGR4 and LGR5 existed as dimers on the cell surface, and
LGR5 interacted with both FZD and LRP6 of the Wnt signalosome to enhance LRP6
phosphorylation and potentiate Wnt-β-catenin signaling. These findings provide a 
molecular basis for the weaker activity of LGR5 in the potentiation of Wnt
signaling that may underlie the distinct roles of LGR4 and LGR5 in organ
development, as well as the self-renewal and fitness of adult stem cells.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) proteins regulate multiple cellular
functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix
formation. The dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes diseases such as cancer
and fibrosis, and therefore, understanding the biochemical basis of TGF-β signal 
transduction is important for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in these
diseases. SMAD proteins are transcription factors that mediate TGF-β
signaling-dependent gene expression. The transcriptional coactivator CBP directly
interacts with the MH2 domains of SMAD2 to activate SMAD complex-dependent gene
expression. Here, we report the structural basis for CBP recognition by SMAD2.
The crystal structures of the SMAD2 MH2 domain in complex with the SMAD2-binding 
region of CBP showed that CBP forms an amphiphilic helix on the hydrophobic
surface of SMAD2. The expression of a mutated CBP peptide that showed increased
SMAD2 binding repressed SMAD2-dependent gene expression in response to TGF-β
signaling in cultured cells. Disrupting the interaction between SMAD2 and CBP may
therefore be a promising strategy for suppressing SMAD-dependent gene expression.

Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons characterizes Parkinson's
disease (PD). This neuronal loss occurs through diverse mechanisms, including a
form of programmed cell death dependent on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) 
called parthanatos. Deficient activity of the kinase Akt1 and aggregation of the 
protein α-synuclein are also implicated in disease pathogenesis. Here, we found
that Akt1 suppressed parthanatos in dopaminergic neurons through a
transcriptional mechanism. Overexpressing constitutively active Akt1 in SH-SY5Y
cells or culturing cells with chlorogenic acid (a polyphenol found in coffee that
activates Akt1) stimulated the CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of the
gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146. RNF146 inhibited PARP1 not through 
its E3 ligase function but rather by binding to and sequestering PAR, which
enhanced the survival of cultured cells exposed to the dopaminergic neuronal
toxin 6-OHDA or α-synuclein aggregation. In mice, intraperitoneal administration 
of chlorogenic acid activated the Akt1-CREB-RNF146 pathway in the brain and
provided neuroprotection against both 6-OHDA and combinatorial α-synucleinopathy 
in an RNF146-dependent manner. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Akt1-CREB
pathway was observed in postmortem brain samples from patients with PD. The
findings suggest that therapeutic restoration of RNF146 expression, such as by
activating the Akt1-CREB pathway, might halt neurodegeneration in PD.

Renal fibrosis is a common end point for kidney injury and many chronic kidney
diseases. Fibrogenesis depends on the sustained activation of myofibroblasts,
which deposit the extracellular matrix that causes progressive scarring and organ
failure. Here, we showed that the transcription factor SOX9 was associated with
kidney fibrosis in humans and required for experimentally induced kidney fibrosis
in mice. From genome-wide analysis, we identified Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as
acting downstream of SOX9 in kidney fibrosis. NAV3 increased in abundance and
colocalized with SOX9 after renal injury in mice, and both SOX9 and NAV3 were
present in diseased human kidneys. In an in vitro model of renal pericyte
transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, we demonstrated that NAV3 was required 
for multiple aspects of fibrogenesis, including actin polymerization linked to
cell migration and sustained activation of the mechanosensitive transcription
factor YAP1. In summary, our work identifies a SOX9-NAV3-YAP1 axis involved in
the progression of kidney fibrosis and points to NAV3 as a potential target for
pharmacological intervention.

Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a second messenger that 
releases Ca2+ from acidic organelles through the activation of two-pore channels 
(TPCs) to regulate endolysosomal trafficking events. NAADP action is mediated by 
NAADP-binding protein(s) of unknown identity that confer NAADP sensitivity to
TPCs. Here, we used a "clickable" NAADP-based photoprobe to isolate human
NAADP-binding proteins and identified Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2
(JPT2) as a TPC accessory protein required for endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2+
signaling. JPT2 was also required for the translocation of a severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus through the
endolysosomal system. Thus, JPT2 is a component of the NAADP receptor complex
that is essential for TPC-dependent Ca2+ signaling and control of coronaviral
entry.

NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release through type 1 ryanodine receptors (RYR1) is a major
mechanism underlying the earliest signals in T cell activation, which are the
formation of Ca2+ microdomains. In our characterization of the molecular
machinery underlying NAADP action, we identified an NAADP-binding protein, called
hematological and neurological expressed 1-like protein (HN1L) [also known as
Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2)]. Gene deletion of Hn1l/Jpt2 in
human Jurkat and primary rat T cells resulted in decreased numbers of initial
Ca2+ microdomains and delayed the onset and decreased the amplitude of global
Ca2+ signaling. Photoaffinity labeling demonstrated direct binding of NAADP to
recombinant HN1L/JPT2. T cell receptor/CD3-dependent coprecipitation of HN1L/JPT2
with RYRs and colocalization of these proteins suggest that HN1L/JPT2 connects
NAADP formation with the activation of RYR channels within the first seconds of T
cell activation. Thus, HN1L/JPT2 enables NAADP to activate Ca2+ release from the 
endoplasmic reticulum through RYR.

Innate immune responses to Gram-negative bacteria depend on the recognition of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by a receptor complex that includes CD14 and TLR4. In
dendritic cells (DCs), CD14 enhances the activation not only of TLR4 but also
that of the NFAT family of transcription factors, which suppresses cell survival 
and promotes the production of inflammatory mediators. NFAT activation requires
Ca2+ mobilization. In DCs, Ca2+ mobilization in response to LPS depends on
phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2), which produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).
Here, we showed that the IP3 receptor 3 (IP3R3) and ITPKB, a kinase that converts
IP3 to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), were both necessary for Ca2+
mobilization and NFAT activation in mouse and human DCs. A pool of IP3R3 was
located on the plasma membrane of DCs, where it colocalized with CD14 and ITPKB. 
Upon LPS binding to CD14, ITPKB was required for Ca2+ mobilization through plasma
membrane-localized IP3R3 and for NFAT nuclear translocation. Pharmacological
inhibition of ITPKB in mice reduced both LPS-induced tissue swelling and the
severity of inflammatory arthritis to a similar extent as that induced by the
inhibition of NFAT using nanoparticles that delivered an NFAT-inhibiting peptide 
specifically to phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that ITPKB may represent a 
promising target for anti-inflammatory therapies that aim to inhibit specific DC 
functions.

The myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of myeloid-derived cells (MDCs) is central to
cellular innate immunity. Upon MDC activation, MPO is secreted into phagosomes
where it catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent
chlorinating oxidant. Here, we demonstrated that the myeloid lineage-restricted
MPO-HOCl system had antitumor effects in early melanoma growth in aged mice.
Orthotopic melanomas grew more slowly in immunocompetent MPO+/+ host mice
compared to age-matched syngeneic MPO-/- mice. Real-time intravital tumor imaging
in vivo and in cell cocultures revealed a cell-cell proximity-dependent
association between MDC-derived MPO enzyme activity and blockade of
ligand-induced IκBα degradation in tumor cells. HOCl directly trans-inhibited IκB
kinase (IKK) activity in tumor cells, thereby decreasing nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) transcriptional activation and inducing changes in the expression of
genes involved in metabolic pathways, cell cycle progression, and DNA
replication. By contrast, HOCl induced transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cells
related to ion transport and the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways that are
associated with T cell activation. MPO increased the circulating concentrations
of the myeloid cell-attracting cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL5, enhanced local
infiltration by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and decreased tumor growth. Overall,
these data reveal a role for MDC-derived HOCl as a small-molecule paracrine
signaling factor that trans-inhibits IKK in melanoma tumor cells, mediating
antitumor responses during early tumor progression.

The complex mTORC2 is accepted to be the kinase that controls the phosphorylation
of the hydrophobic motif, a key regulatory switch for AGC kinases, although
whether mTOR directly phosphorylates this motif remains controversial. Here, we
identified an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation site that we termed the TOR
interaction motif (TIM; F-x3-F-pT), which controls the phosphorylation of the
hydrophobic motif of PKC and Akt and the activity of these kinases. The TIM is
invariant in mTORC2-dependent AGC kinases, is evolutionarily conserved, and
coevolved with mTORC2 components. Mutation of this motif in Akt1 and PKCβII
abolished cellular kinase activity by impairing activation loop and hydrophobic
motif phosphorylation. mTORC2 directly phosphorylated the PKC TIM in vitro, and
this phosphorylation event was detected in mouse brain. Overexpression of PDK1 in
mTORC2-deficient cells rescued hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC and Akt
by a mechanism dependent on their intrinsic catalytic activity, revealing that
mTORC2 facilitates the PDK1 phosphorylation step, which, in turn, enables
autophosphorylation. Structural analysis revealed that PKC homodimerization is
driven by a TIM-containing helix, and biophysical proximity assays showed that
newly synthesized, unphosphorylated PKC dimerizes in cells. Furthermore,
disruption of the dimer interface by stapled peptides promoted hydrophobic motif 
phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which mTORC2 relieves nascent PKC
dimerization through TIM phosphorylation, recruiting PDK1 to phosphorylate the
activation loop and triggering intramolecular hydrophobic motif
autophosphorylation. Identification of TIM phosphorylation and its role in the
regulation of PKC provides the basis for AGC kinase regulation by mTORC2.

The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway is pivotal for innate immunity
against invading viruses, and dysregulation of this molecular cascade has been
linked to various diseases. Here, we identified dimethylarginine
dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2) as a potent regulator of the RLR-mediated
antiviral response in human and mouse. Overexpression of DDAH2 attenuated RLR
signaling, whereas loss of DDAH2 function enhanced RLR signaling and suppressed
viral replication ex vivo and in mice. Upon viral infection, DDAH2 relocated to
mitochondria, where it induced the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the
activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promoted mitochondrial
fission and blocked the activation of innate immune responses mediated by
mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a kinase 
downstream of MAVS, inhibited DDAH2 by phosphorylating DDAH2 at multiple sites.
Our study thus identifies a reciprocal inhibitory loop between the DDAH2-NO
cascade and the RLR signaling pathway that fine-tunes the antiviral immune
response.

Chloride intracellular channels 1 (CLIC1) and 4 (CLIC4) are expressed in
endothelial cells and regulate angiogenic behaviors in vitro, and the expression 
of Clic4 is important for vascular development and function in mice. Here, we
found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 in endothelial cells regulate critical G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways associated with vascular development and
disease. In cultured endothelial cells, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 transiently
translocated to the plasma membrane in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P).
Both CLIC1 and CLIC4 were essential for mediating S1P-induced activation of the
small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 downstream of S1P receptor 1
(S1PR1). In contrast, only CLIC1 was essential for S1P-induced activation of the 
small GTPase RhoA downstream of S1PR2 and S1PR3. Neither were required for other 
S1P-S1PR signaling outputs. Rescue experiments revealed that CLIC1 and CLIC4 were
not functionally interchangeable, suggesting distinct and specific functions for 
CLICs in transducing GPCR signaling. These CLIC-mediated mechanisms were critical
for S1P-induced stimulation of the barrier function in endothelial cell
monolayers. Our results define CLICs as previously unknown players in the
pathways linking GPCRs to small GTPases and vascular endothelial function.

During cellular stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident dual kinase and RNase Ire1 splices an intron 
from HAC1 mRNA in the cytosol, thereby releasing its translational block. Hac1
protein then activates an adaptive cellular stress response called the unfolded
protein response (UPR) that maintains ER homeostasis. The polarity-inducing
protein kinases Kin1 and Kin2 contribute to HAC1 mRNA processing. Here, we showed
that an RNA-protein complex that included the endocytic proteins Pal1 and Pal2
mediated HAC1 mRNA splicing downstream of Kin1 and Kin2. We found that Pal1 and
Pal2 bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of HAC1 mRNA, and a yeast strain
lacking both Pal1 and Pal2 was deficient in HAC1 mRNA processing. We also showed 
that Kin1 and Kin2 directly phosphorylated Pal2, and that a nonphosphorylatable
Pal2 mutant could not rescue the UPR defect in a pal1Δ pal2Δ strain. Thus, our
work uncovers a Kin1/2-Pal2 signaling pathway that coordinates HAC1 mRNA
processing and ER homeostasis.

The activation of Ras signaling is a major early event of oncogenesis in many
contexts, yet paradoxically, Ras signaling induces cellular senescence, which
prevents tumorigenesis. Thus, Ras-activated cells must overcome senescence to
develop into cancer. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, we
found that the ETS family transcriptional activator Pointed (Pnt) was necessary
and sufficient to trigger cellular senescence upon Ras activation and blocked
Ras-induced tumor growth in eye-antennal discs. Through analyses of mosaic discs 
using various genetic tools, we identified a mechanism of tumor progression in
which loss of cell polarity, a common driver of epithelial oncogenesis, abrogated
Ras-induced cellular senescence through microRNA-mediated inhibition of Pnt.
Mechanistically, polarity defects in Ras-activated cells caused activation of the
Hippo effector Yorkie (Yki), which induced the expression of the microRNA bantam 
bantam-mediated repression of the E3 ligase-associated protein Tribbles (Trbl)
relieved Ras- and Akt-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor FoxO. The 
restoration of FoxO activity in Ras-activated cells induced the expression of the
microRNAs miR-9c and miR-79, which led to reduced pnt expression, thereby
abrogating cellular senescence and promoting tumor progression. Our findings
provide a mechanistic explanation for how Ras-activated tumors progress toward
malignancy by overcoming cellular senescence.

Expression of the transmembrane protein Tim-3 is increased on dysregulated T
cells undergoing chronic activation, including during chronic infection and in
solid tumors. Thus, Tim-3 is generally thought of as an inhibitory protein. We
and others previously reported that under some circumstances, Tim-3 exerts
paradoxical costimulatory activity in T cells (and other cells), including
enhancement of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein. Here, we examined the
upstream signaling pathways that control Tim-3-mediated increases in
phosphorylated S6 in T cells. We also defined the localization of Tim-3 relative 
to the T cell immune synapse and its effects on downstream signaling. Recruitment
of Tim-3 to the immune synapse was mediated exclusively by the transmembrane
domain, replacement of which impaired the ability of Tim-3 to costimulate T cell 
receptor (TCR)-dependent S6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, enforced localization
of the Tim-3 cytoplasmic domain to the immune synapse in a chimeric antigen
receptor still enabled T cell activation. Together, our findings are consistent
with a model whereby Tim-3 enhances TCR-proximal signaling under acute
conditions.

Many viral proteases mediate the evasion of antiviral innate immunity by cleaving
adapter proteins in the interferon (IFN) induction pathway. Host proteases are
also involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report that the
transmembrane protease hepsin (also known as TMPRSS1), which is predominantly
present in hepatocytes, inhibited the induction of type I IFN during viral
infections. Knocking out hepsin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased
the viral infection-induced expression of Ifnb1, an Ifnb1 promoter reporter, and 
an IFN-sensitive response element promoter reporter. Ectopic expression of hepsin
in cultured human hepatocytes and HEK293T cells suppressed the induction of IFNβ 
during viral infections by reducing the abundance of STING. These effects
depended on the protease activity of hepsin. We identified a putative hepsin
target site in STING and showed that mutating this site protected STING from
hepsin-mediated cleavage. In addition to hepatocytes, several hepsin-producing
prostate cancer cell lines showed reduced STING-mediated type I IFN induction and
responses. These results reveal a role for hepsin in suppressing STING-mediated
type I IFN induction, which may contribute to the vulnerability of hepatocytes to
chronic viral infections.

Unlike early transcriptional responses to mitogens, later events are less
well-characterized. Here, we identified delayed down-regulated genes (DDGs) in
mammary cells after prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The
expression of these DDGs was low in mammary tumors and correlated with prognosis.
The proteins encoded by several DDGs directly bind to and inactivate oncoproteins
and might therefore act as tumor suppressors. The transcription factor teashirt
zinc finger homeobox 2 (TSHZ2) is encoded by a DDG, and we found that
overexpression of TSHZ2 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and accelerated
mammary gland development in mice. Although the gene TSHZ2 localizes to a locus
(20q13.2) that is frequently amplified in breast cancer, we found that
hypermethylation of its promoter correlated with down-regulation of TSHZ2
expression in patients. Yeast two-hybrid screens and protein-fragment
complementation assays in mammalian cells indicated that TSHZ2 nucleated a
multiprotein complex containing PRC1/Ase1, cyclin B1, and additional proteins
that regulate cytokinesis. TSHZ2 increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of
PRC1, a key driver of mitosis, mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore,
similar to the tumor suppressive transcription factor p53, TSHZ2 inhibited
transcription from the PRC1 promoter. By recognizing DDGs as a distinct group in 
the transcriptional response to EGF, our findings uncover a group of tumor
suppressors and reveal a role for TSHZ2 in cell cycle regulation.

The maintenance of telomere length supports repetitive cell division and
therefore plays a central role in cancer development and progression. Telomeres
are extended by either the enzyme telomerase or the alternative lengthening of
telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we found that the telomere-associated protein
SLX4IP dictates telomere proteome composition by recruiting and activating the E3
SUMO ligase PIAS1 to the SLX4 complex. PIAS1 SUMOylated the telomere-binding
protein RAP1, which disrupted its interaction with the telomere-binding protein
TRF2 and facilitated its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In the cytosol, RAP1 bound 
to IκB kinase (IKK), resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB
and its induction of Jagged-1 expression, which promoted Notch signaling and the 
institution of ALT. This axis could be targeted therapeutically in ALT-driven
cancers and in tumor cells that develop resistance to antitelomerase therapies.
Our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying SLX4IP-dependent telomere
plasticity and demonstrate the role of telomere proteins in directly coordinating
intracellular signaling and telomere maintenance dynamics.

Murine γδ17 cells, which are T cells that bear the γδ T cell receptor (TCRγδ) and
secrete interleukin-17A (IL-17A), are generated in the thymus and are critical
for various immune responses. Although strong TCRγδ signals are required for the 
development of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-secreting γδ cells (γδIFN cells), the
generation of γδ17 cells requires weaker TCRγδ signaling. Here, we demonstrated
that constrained activation of the kinase Syk downstream of TCRγδ was required
for the thymic development of γδ17 cells. Increasing or decreasing Syk activity
by stimulating TCRγδ or inhibiting Syk, respectively, substantially reduced γδ17 
cell numbers. This delimited Syk activity optimally engaged the phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which maintained the expression of master 
regulators of the IL-17 program, RORγt and c-Maf. Inhibition of PI3K not only
abrogated γδ17 cell development but also augmented the development of a distinct,
previously undescribed subset of γδ T cells. These CD8+Ly6a+ γδ T cells had a
type-I IFN gene expression signature and expanded in response to stimulation with
IFN-β. Collectively, these studies elucidate how weaker TCRγδ signaling engages
distinct signaling pathways to specify the γδ17 cell fate and identifies a role
for type-I IFNs in γδ T cell development.

The pleiotropic chemokine CXCL12 is involved in diverse physiological and
pathophysiological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, leukocyte
migration, and tumor metastasis. It is known to engage the classical receptor
CXCR4 and the atypical receptor ACKR3. Differential receptor engagement can
transduce distinct cellular signals and effects as well as alter the amount of
free, extracellular chemokine. CXCR4 binds both monomeric and the more commonly
found dimeric forms of CXCL12, whereas ACKR3 binds monomeric forms. Here, we
found that CXCL12 also bound to the atypical receptor ACKR1 (previously known as 
Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines or DARC). In vitro nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that dimeric
CXCL12 bound to the extracellular N terminus of ACKR1 with low nanomolar
affinity, whereas the binding affinity of monomeric CXCL12 was orders of
magnitude lower. In transfected MDCK cells and primary human Duffy-positive
erythrocytes, a dimeric, but not a monomeric, construct of CXCL12 efficiently
bound to and internalized with ACKR1. This interaction between CXCL12 and ACKR1
provides another layer of regulation of the multiple biological functions of
CXCL12. The findings also raise the possibility that ACKR1 can bind other dimeric
chemokines, thus potentially further expanding the role of ACKR1 in chemokine
retention and presentation.

CD200 receptor 1 (CD200R) is an inhibitory immunoreceptor that suppresses
Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced cytokine production through the adaptor protein 
Dok2 and the GTPase activating protein (GAP) p120-RasGAP, which can be cleaved
during mild cellular stress. We found that in the presence of cleaved
p120-RasGAP, CD200R lost its capacity to inhibit phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 
protein (rpS6), suggesting the reduced activity of mammalian target of rapamycin 
complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) with interferon-α (IFN-α) resulted in increased amounts of cleaved
p120-RasGAP. Upon pretreatment of cells with increasing concentrations of IFN-α, 
CD200R switched from inhibiting to potentiating the TLR7- and TLR8-induced
expression of the gene encoding IFN-γ, a cytokine that is important for innate
and adaptive immunity and is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
pathogenesis. PBMC from patients with SLE, a prototypic type I IFN disease, had
an increased abundance of cleaved p120-RasGAP compared to that in cells from
healthy controls. In a subset of SLE patients, CD200R stopped functioning as an
inhibitory receptor or potentiated TLR-induced IFNG mRNA expression. Thus, our
data suggest that type I IFN rewires CD200R signaling to be proinflammatory,
which could contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation in patients with SLE.

Centrosome amplification is a hallmark of cancer, and centrosome clustering is
essential for cancer cell survival. The mitotic kinesin HSET is an essential
contributor to this process. Recent studies have highlighted novel functions for 
intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins in regulating motors and mitotic
processes. Here, using siRNA knock-down of various IFT proteins or AID-inducible 
degradation of endogenous IFT88 in combination with small-molecule inhibition of 
HSET, we show that IFT proteins together with HSET are required for efficient
centrosome clustering. We identify a direct interaction between the kinesin HSET 
and IFT proteins, and we define how IFT proteins contribute to clustering
dynamics during mitosis using high-resolution live imaging of centrosomes.
Finally, we demonstrate the requirement of IFT88 for efficient centrosome
clustering in a variety of cancer cell lines naturally harboring supernumerary
centrosomes and its importance for cancer cell proliferation. Overall, our data
unravel a novel role for the IFT machinery in centrosome clustering during
mitosis in cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is the key E3 ubiquitin ligase which
directs mitotic progression and exit by catalysing the sequential ubiquitination 
of specific substrates. The activity of the APC/C in mitosis is restrained by the
spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which coordinates chromosome segregation with 
the assembly of the mitotic spindle. The SAC effector is the mitotic checkpoint
complex (MCC), which binds and inhibits the APC/C. It is incompletely understood 
how the APC/C switches substrate specificity in a cell cycle-specific manner. For
instance, it is unclear how in prometaphase, when APC/C activity towards cyclin B
and securin is repressed by the MCC, the kinase Nek2A is ubiquitinated. Here, we 
combine biochemical and structural analysis with functional studies in cells to
show that Nek2A is a conformational-specific binder of the APC/C-MCC complex
(APC/CMCC ) and that, in contrast to cyclin A, Nek2A can be ubiquitinated
efficiently by the APC/C in conjunction with both the E2 enzymes UbcH10 and
UbcH5. We propose that these special features of Nek2A allow its
prometaphase-specific ubiquitination.

Neuronal activity is responsible for the high energy consumption in the brain.
However, the cellular mechanisms draining ATP upon the arrival of a stimulus are 
yet to be explored systematically at the post-synapse. Here, we provide evidence 
that a significant fraction of ATP is consumed upon glutamate stimulation to
energize mGluR-induced protein synthesis. We find that both mGluR and NMDAR alter
protein synthesis and ATP consumption with distinct kinetics at the
synaptic-dendritic compartments. While mGluR activation leads to a rapid and
sustained reduction in neuronal ATP levels, NMDAR activation has no immediate
impact on the same. ATP consumption correlates inversely with the kinetics of
protein synthesis for both receptors. We observe a persistent elevation in
protein synthesis within 5 minutes of mGluR activation and a robust inhibition of
the same within 2 minutes of NMDAR activation, assessed by the phosphorylation
status of eEF2 and metabolic labeling. However, a delayed protein
synthesis-dependent ATP expenditure ensues after 15 minutes of NMDAR stimulation.
We identify a central role for AMPK in the correlation between protein synthesis 
and ATP consumption. AMPK is dephosphorylated and inhibited upon mGluR
activation, while it is phosphorylated upon NMDAR activation. Perturbing AMPK
activity disrupts receptor-specific modulations of eEF2 phosphorylation and
protein synthesis. Our observations, therefore, demonstrate that the regulation
of the AMPK-eEF2 signaling axis by glutamate receptors alters neuronal protein
synthesis and bioenergetics.

Demyelination is a common pathological feature of a large number of
neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease 
(HD). Laquinimod (LAQ) has been found to have therapeutic effects on multiple
sclerosis and HD. However, the mechanism underlying LAQ's therapeutic effects
remains unknown. Using HD mice that selectively express mutant huntingtin in
oligodendrocytes and show demyelination, we found that LAQ reduces the Ser259
phosphorylation on myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), an oligodendrocyte-specific
transcription factor promoting the expression of myelin-associated genes. The
reduced MYRF phosphorylation inhibits MYRF's binding to mutant huntingtin and
increases the expression of myelin-associated genes. We also found that PRKG2, a 
cGMP-activated protein kinase subunit II, promotes the Ser259-MYRF
phosphorylation and that knocking down PRKG2 increased myelin-associated
protein's expression in HD mice. Our findings suggest that PRKG2-regulated
phosphorylation of MYRF is involved in demyelination and can serve as a potential
therapeutic target for reducing demyelination.

Autophagy is an essential cellular quality control process that has emerged as a 
critical one for vascular homeostasis. Here, we show that trichoplein (TCHP)
links autophagy with endothelial cell (EC) function. TCHP localizes to centriolar
satellites, where it binds and stabilizes PCM1. Loss of TCHP leads to
delocalization and proteasome-dependent degradation of PCM1, further resulting in
degradation of PCM1's binding partner GABARAP. Autophagic flux under basal
conditions is impaired in THCP-depleted ECs, and SQSTM1/p62 (p62) accumulates. We
further show that TCHP promotes autophagosome maturation and efficient clearance 
of p62 within lysosomes, without affecting their degradative capacity. Reduced
TCHP and high p62 levels are detected in primary ECs from patients with coronary 
artery disease. This phenotype correlates with impaired EC function and can be
ameliorated by NF-κB inhibition. Moreover, Tchp knock-out mice accumulate of p62 
in the heart and cardiac vessels correlating with reduced cardiac
vascularization. Taken together, our data reveal that TCHP regulates endothelial 
cell function via an autophagy-mediated mechanism.

The Fanconi anaemia (FA) pathway is a dedicated pathway for the repair of DNA
interstrand crosslinks and is additionally activated in response to other forms
of replication stress. A key step in the FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of 
each of the two subunits (FANCI and FANCD2) of the ID2 complex on specific lysine
residues. However, the molecular function of these modifications has been unknown
for nearly two decades. Here, we find that ubiquitination of FANCD2 acts to
increase ID2's affinity for double-stranded DNA via promoting a large-scale
conformational change in the complex. The resulting complex encircles DNA, by
forming a secondary "Arm" ID2 interface. Ubiquitination of FANCI, on the other
hand, largely protects the ubiquitin on FANCD2 from USP1-UAF1 deubiquitination,
with key hydrophobic residues of FANCI's ubiquitin being important for this
protection. In effect, both of these post-translational modifications function to
stabilize a conformation in which the ID2 complex encircles DNA.

Inflammasomes are intracellular complexes that form in the cytosol of
inflammatory cells. NLRP3 is one of the sensor proteins in the complex that can
recognize a wide variety of stimuli ranging from microbial components to
environmental particulates. Here, we report that in mouse airway epithelial cells
(AECs), inflammasome activation is inhibited by EphA2, a member of the
transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor family, via tyrosine phosphorylation of
NLRP3 in a model of reovirus infection. We find that EphA2 depletion markedly
enhances interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) production in response
to the virus. EphA2-/- mice show stronger inflammatory infiltration and enhanced 
inflammasome activation upon viral infection, and aggravated asthma symptoms upon
ovalbumin (ova) induction. Mechanistically, EphA2 binds to NLRP3 and induces its 
phosphorylation at Tyr132, thereby interfering with ASC speck formation and
blocking the activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome. These data demonstrate that
reovirus employs EphA2 to suppress inflammasome activation in AECs and that EphA2
deficiency causes a pathological exacerbation of asthma in an ova-induced asthma 
model.

Negative regulation of immunoreceptor signaling is required for preventing
hyperimmune activation and maintaining immune homeostasis. The roles of p38IP in 
immunoreceptor signaling remain unclear. Here, we show that p38IP suppresses
T-cell receptor (TCR)/LPS-activated NF-κB and p38 by targeting TAK1 kinase and
that p38IP protein levels are downregulated in human PBMCs from rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) patients, inversely correlating with the enhanced activity of
NF-κB and p38. Mechanistically, p38IP interacts with TAK1 to disassemble the
TAK1-TAB (TAK1-binding protein) complex. p38IP overexpression decreases
TCR-induced binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains to TAK1 but
increases that to TAB2, and p38IP knockdown shows the opposite effects,
indicating unanchored K63-linked polyUb chain transfer from TAB2 to TAK1. p38IP
dynamically interacts with TAK1 upon stimulation, because of the polyUb chain
transfer and the higher binding affinity of TAK1 and p38IP for polyUb-bound TAB2 
and TAK1, respectively. Moreover, p38IP scaffolds the deubiquitinase USP4 to
deubiquitinate TAK1 once TAK1 is activated. These findings reveal a novel role
and the mechanisms of p38IP in controlling TCR/LPS signaling and suggest that
p38IP might participate in RA pathogenesis.

Nuclear accessibility of transcription factors controls gene expression,
co-regulated by Ran-dependent nuclear localization and a competitive regulatory
network. Here, we reveal that nuclear import factor-facilitated transcriptional
repression attenuates ribosome biogenesis under chronic salt stress. Kap114p, one
of the karyopherin-βs (Kap-βs) that mediates nuclear import of yeast TATA-binding
protein (yTBP), exhibits a yTBP-binding affinity four orders of magnitude greater
than its counterparts and suppresses binding of yTBP with DNA. Our crystal
structure of Kap114p reveals an extensively negatively charged concave surface,
accounting for high-affinity basic-protein binding. KAP114 knockout in yeast
leads to a high-salt growth defect, with transcriptomic analyses revealing that
Kap114p modulates expression of genes associated with ribosomal biogenesis by
suppressing yTBP binding to target promoters, a trans-repression mechanism we
attribute to reduced nuclear Ran levels under salinity stress. Our findings
reveal that Ran integrates the nuclear transport pathway and transcription
regulatory network, allowing yeast to respond to environmental stresses.

From fly to mammals, the Smaug/Samd4 family of prion-like RNA-binding proteins
control gene expression by destabilizing and/or repressing the translation of
numerous target transcripts. However, the regulation of its activity remains
poorly understood. We show that Smaug's protein levels and mRNA repressive
activity are downregulated by Hedgehog signaling in tissue culture cells. These
effects rely on the interaction of Smaug with the G-protein coupled receptor
Smoothened, which promotes the phosphorylation of Smaug by recruiting the kinase 
Fused. The activation of Fused and its binding to Smaug are sufficient to
suppress its ability to form cytosolic bodies and to antagonize its negative
effects on endogenous targets. Importantly, we demonstrate in vivo that HH
reduces the levels of smaug mRNA and increases the level of several mRNAs
downregulated by Smaug. Finally, we show that Smaug acts as a positive regulator 
of Hedgehog signaling during wing morphogenesis. These data constitute the first 
evidence for a post-translational regulation of Smaug and reveal that the fate of
several mRNAs bound to Smaug is modulated by a major signaling pathway.

Leaf senescence is a highly complex developmental process that is tightly
controlled by multiple layers of regulation. Abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are two well-known factors that promote leaf senescence. We 
show here that the transcription factor CDF4 positively regulates leaf
senescence. Constitutive and inducible overexpression of CDF4 accelerates leaf
senescence, while knockdown of CDF4 delays it. CDF4 increases endogenous ABA
levels by upregulating the transcription of the ABA biosynthesis genes
9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2, 3 (NCED2, 3) and suppresses H2 O2 scavenging
by repressing expression of the catalase2 (CAT2) gene. NCED2, 3 knockout and CAT2
overexpression partially rescue premature leaf senescence caused by CDF4
overexpression. We also show that CDF4 promotes floral organ abscission by
activating the polygalacturonase PGAZAT gene. Based on these results, we propose 
that the levels of CDF4, ABA, and ROS undergo a gradual increase driven by their 
interlinking positive feedback loops during the leaf senescence and floral organ 
abscission processes.

At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), lipoprotein-related receptor 4 (LRP4)
mediates agrin-induced MuSK phosphorylation that leads to clustering of
acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic region of the skeletal
muscle. Additionally, the ectodomain of LRP4 is necessary for differentiation of 
the presynaptic nerve terminal. However, the molecules regulating LRP4 have not
been fully elucidated yet. Here, we show that the CT domain of connective tissue 
growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) directly binds to the third beta-propeller domain of
LRP4. CTGF/CCN2 enhances the binding of LRP4 to MuSK and facilitates the
localization of LRP4 on the plasma membrane. CTGF/CCN2 enhances agrin-induced
MuSK phosphorylation and AChR clustering in cultured myotubes. Ctgf-deficient
mouse embryos (Ctgf-/- ) have small AChR clusters and abnormal dispersion of
synaptic vesicles along the motor axon. Ultrastructurally, the presynaptic nerve 
terminals have reduced numbers of active zones and mitochondria. Functionally,
Ctgf-/- embryos exhibit impaired NMJ signal transmission. These results indicate 
that CTGF/CCN2 interacts with LRP4 to facilitate clustering of AChRs at the motor
endplate and the maturation of the nerve terminal.

Impairment of PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy is currently proposed to be the
molecular basis of mitochondrial abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD). We here
demonstrate that PINK1 directly phosphorylates Drp1 on S616. Drp1S616
phosphorylation is significantly reduced in cells and mouse tissues deficient for
PINK1, but unaffected by parkin inactivation. PINK1-mediated mitochondrial
fission is Drp1S616 phosphorylation dependent. Overexpression of either wild-type
Drp1 or of the phosphomimetic mutant Drp1S616D , but not a
dephosphorylation-mimic mutant Drp1S616A , rescues PINK1 deficiency-associated
phenotypes in Drosophila. Moreover, Drp1 restores PINK1-dependent mitochondrial
fission in ATG5-null cells and ATG7-null Drosophila. Reduced Drp1S616
phosphorylation is detected in fibroblasts derived from 4 PD patients harboring
PINK1 mutations and in 4 out of 7 sporadic PD cases. Taken together, we have
identified Drp1 as a substrate of PINK1 and a novel mechanism how PINK1 regulates
mitochondrial fission independent of parkin and autophagy. Our results further
link impaired PINK1-mediated Drp1S616 phosphorylation with the pathogenesis of
both familial and sporadic PD.

The nuclear lamina is essential for the structural integration of the nuclear
envelope. Nuclear envelope rupture and chromatin externalization is a hallmark of
the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NET release was described
as a cellular lysis process; however, this notion has been questioned recently.
Here, we report that during NET formation, nuclear lamin B is not fragmented by
destructive proteolysis, but rather disassembled into intact full-length
molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of PKCα, which 
serves as the kinase to induce lamin B phosphorylation and disassembly, results
in nuclear envelope rupture. Decreasing lamin B phosphorylation by PKCα
inhibition, genetic deletion, or by mutating the PKCα consensus sites on lamin B 
attenuates extracellular trap formation. In addition, strengthening the nuclear
envelope by lamin B overexpression attenuates NET release in vivo and reduces
levels of NET-associated inflammatory cytokines in UVB-irradiated skin of lamin B
transgenic mice. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding of NET
formation by showing that PKCα-mediated lamin B phosphorylation drives nuclear
envelope rupture for chromatin release in neutrophils.

Maternal mRNA degradation is a critical event of the maternal-to-zygotic
transition (MZT) that determines the developmental potential of early embryos.
Nuclear Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPNs) are extensively involved in mRNA
post-transcriptional regulation, but their function in the MZT has not been
investigated. In this study, we find that the maternally expressed PABPN1-like
(PABPN1L), rather than its ubiquitously expressed homolog PABPN1, acts as an
mRNA-binding adapter of the mammalian MZT licensing factor BTG4, which mediates
maternal mRNA clearance. Female Pabpn1l null mice produce morphologically normal 
oocytes but are infertile owing to early developmental arrest of the resultant
embryos at the 1- to 2-cell stage. Deletion of Pabpn1l impairs the deadenylation 
and degradation of a subset of BTG4-targeted maternal mRNAs during the MZT. In
addition to recruiting BTG4 to the mRNA 3'-poly(A) tails, PABPN1L is also
required for BTG4 protein accumulation in maturing oocytes by protecting BTG4
from SCF-βTrCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation. 
This study highlights a noncanonical cytoplasmic function of nuclear
poly(A)-binding protein in mRNA turnover, as well as its physiological importance
during the MZT.

Controlled cell growth and proliferation are essential for tissue homeostasis and
development. Wnt and Hippo signaling are well known as positive and negative
regulators of cell proliferation, respectively. The regulation of Hippo signaling
by the Wnt pathway has been shown, but how and which components of Wnt signaling 
are involved in the activation of Hippo signaling during nutrient starvation are 
unknown. Here, we report that a reduction in the level of low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) during nutrient starvation induces
phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of YAP, inhibiting YAP-dependent
transcription. Phosphorylation of YAP via loss of LRP6 is mediated by large tumor
suppressor kinases 1/2 (LATS1/2) and Merlin. We found that O-GlcNAcylation of
LRP6 was reduced, and the overall amount of LRP6 was decreased via
endocytosis-mediated lysosomal degradation during nutrient starvation. Merlin
binds to LRP6; when LRP6 is less O-GlcNAcylated, Merlin dissociates from it and
becomes capable of interacting with LATS1 to induce phosphorylation of YAP. Our
data suggest that LRP6 has unexpected roles as a nutrient sensor and Hippo
signaling regulator.

In the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), new olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are 
persistently generated to replace lost neurons throughout an organism's lifespan.
This process predominantly depends on the proliferation of globose basal cells
(GBCs), the actively dividing stem cells in the MOE. Here, by using CRISPR/Cas9
and RNAi coupled with adeno-associated virus (AAV) nose delivery approaches, we
demonstrated that knockdown of miR-200b/a in the MOE resulted in supernumerary
Mash1-marked GBCs and decreased numbers of differentiated OSNs, accompanied by
abrogation of male behaviors. We further showed that in the MOE, miR-200b/a
targets the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase TET3, which
cooperates with RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) to exert their
functions. Deficiencies including proliferation, differentiation, and behaviors
illustrated in miR-200b/a knockdown mice were rescued by suppressing either TET3 
or REST. Our work describes a mechanism of coordination of GBC proliferation and 
differentiation in the MOE and olfactory male behaviors through miR-200/TET3/REST
signaling.

Nutrient sensing by the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) requires its translocation to the
lysosomal membrane. Upon amino acids removal, mTORC1 becomes cytosolic and
inactive, yet its precise subcellular localization and the mechanism of
inhibition remain elusive. Here, we identified Aster-C as a negative regulator of
mTORC1 signaling. Aster-C earmarked a special rough ER subdomain where it
sequestered mTOR together with the GATOR2 complex to prevent mTORC1 activation
during nutrient starvation. Amino acids stimulated rapid disassociation of mTORC1
from Aster-C concurrently with assembly of COP I vesicles which escorted mTORC1
to the lysosomal membrane. Consequently, ablation of Aster-C led to spontaneous
activation of mTORC1 and dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes, whereas inhibition 
of COP I vesicle biogenesis or actin dynamics prevented mTORC1 activation.
Together, these findings identified Aster-C as a missing link between lysosomal
trafficking and mTORC1 activation by revealing an unexpected role of COP I
vesicles in mTORC1 signaling.

Activation of the type 1 interferon response is extensively connected to the
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Loss of function of Immunity Related GTPase 
M (IRGM) has also been associated to several autoimmune diseases, but its
mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we found that IRGM is a master negative
regulator of the interferon response. Several nucleic acid-sensing pathways
leading to interferon-stimulated gene expression are highly activated in IRGM
knockout mice and human cells. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with 
nucleic acid sensor proteins, including cGAS and RIG-I, and mediates their
p62-dependent autophagic degradation to restrain interferon signaling. Further,
IRGM deficiency results in defective mitophagy leading to the accumulation of
defunct leaky mitochondria that release cytosolic DAMPs and mtROS. Hence, IRGM
deficiency increases not only the levels of the sensors, but also those of the
stimuli that trigger the activation of the cGAS-STING and RIG-I-MAVS signaling
axes, leading to robust induction of IFN responses. Taken together, this study
defines the molecular mechanisms by which IRGM maintains interferon homeostasis
and protects from autoimmune diseases.

The transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is essential for the development
of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their function in immune homeostasis. Previous 
studies have shown that in natural Tregs (nTregs), FOXP3 can be regulated by
polyubiquitination and deubiquitination. However, the molecular players active in
this pathway, especially those modulating FOXP3 by deubiquitination in the
distinct induced Treg (iTreg) lineage, remain unclear. Here, we identify the
ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44 (USP44) as a novel deubiquitinase for FOXP3.
USP44 interacts with and stabilizes FOXP3 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin
modifications. Notably, TGF-β induces USP44 expression during iTreg
differentiation. USP44 co-operates with USP7 to stabilize and deubiquitinate
FOXP3. Tregs genetically lacking USP44 are less effective than their wild-type
counterparts, both in vitro and in multiple in vivo models of inflammatory
disease and cancer. These findings suggest that USP44 plays an important role in 
the post-translational regulation of Treg function and is thus a potential
therapeutic target for tolerance-breaking anti-cancer immunotherapy.

Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.

SIRT1 is a NAD+ -dependent deacetylase that controls key metabolic and signaling 
pathways, including inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor. However, the
mechanisms controlling SIRT1 enzymatic activity in the context of cancer are
unclear. Here, we show that the previously undescribed CSAG2 protein is a direct 
activator of SIRT1. CSAG2 is normally restricted to expression in the male
germline but is frequently re-activated in cancers. CSAG2 is necessary for cancer
cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Biochemical studies
revealed that CSAG2 directly binds to and stimulates SIRT1 activity toward
multiple substrates. Importantly, CSAG2 enhances SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of 
p53, inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, and improves cell survival in
response to genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, CSAG2 binds SIRT1 catalytic domain
and promotes activity independent of altering substrate affinity. Together, our
results identify a previously undescribed mechanism for SIRT1 activation in
cancer cells and highlight unanticipated approaches to therapeutically modulate
SIRT1.

MICU1 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that inhibits mitochondrial
calcium entry; elevated MICU1 expression is characteristic of many cancers,
including ovarian cancer. MICU1 induces both glycolysis and chemoresistance and
is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, there are currently no
available interventions to normalize aberrant MICU1 expression. Here, we
demonstrate that microRNA-195-5p (miR-195) directly targets the 3' UTR of the
MICU1 mRNA and represses MICU1 expression. Additionally, miR-195 is
under-expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines, and restoring miR-195 expression
reestablishes native MICU1 levels and the associated phenotypes. Stable
expression of miR-195 in a human xenograft model of ovarian cancer significantly 
reduces tumor growth, increases tumor doubling times, and enhances overall
survival. In conclusion, miR-195 controls MICU1 levels in ovarian cancer and
could be exploited to normalize aberrant MICU1 expression, thus reversing both
glycolysis and chemoresistance and consequently improving patient outcomes.

biological function of m6 A on 18S rRNA is still poorly understood. Here, we
report that methyltransferase-like 5 (METTL5) methylates 18S rRNA both in vivo
and in vitro, which is consistent with previous reports. Deletion of Mettl5
causes a dramatic differentiation defect in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
Mechanistically, the m6 A deposited by METTL5 is involved in regulating the
efficient translation of F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), a key
regulator of cell differentiation. Deficiency of METTL5 reduces FBXW7 levels and 
leads to the accumulation of its substrate c-MYC, thereby delaying the onset of
mESC differentiation. Our study uncovers an important role of METTL5-mediated 18S
m6 A in mESC differentiation through translation regulation and provides new
insight into the functional significance of rRNA m6 A.

Signaling via the intracellular pathogen receptors nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-containing proteins NOD1 and NOD2 requires receptor
interacting kinase 2 (RIPK2), an adaptor kinase that can be targeted for the
treatment of various inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of 
how RIPK2 contributes to NOD signaling are not completely understood. We
generated FLAG-tagged RIPK2 knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to study
NOD signaling mechanisms at the endogenous level. Using cells from these mice, we
were able to generate a detailed map of post-translational modifications on
RIPK2. Similar to other reports, we did not detect ubiquitination of RIPK2 lysine
209 during NOD2 signaling. However, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified
a new regulatory region on RIPK2, which dictates the crucial interaction with the
E3 ligase XIAP and downstream signaling outcomes.

Prominin-1 (Prom1) is a major cell surface marker of cancer stem cells, but its
physiological functions in the liver have not been elucidated. We analyzed the
levels of mRNA transcripts in serum-starved primary WT (Prom1+/+ ) and KO
(Prom1-/- ) mouse hepatocytes using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and found that
CREB target genes were downregulated. This initial observation led us to
determine that Prom1 deficiency inhibited cAMP response element-binding protein
(CREB) activation and gluconeogenesis, but not cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation, in
glucagon-, epinephrine-, or forskolin-treated liver tissues and primary
hepatocytes, and mitigated glucagon-induced hyperglycemia. Because Prom1
interacted with radixin, Prom1 deficiency prevented radixin from localizing to
the plasma membrane. Moreover, systemic adenoviral knockdown of radixin inhibited
CREB activation and gluconeogenesis in glucagon-treated liver tissues and primary
hepatocytes, and mitigated glucagon-elicited hyperglycemia. Based on these
results, we conclude that Prom1 regulates hepatic PKA signaling via radixin
functioning as an A kinase-anchored protein (AKAP).

A microdeletion within human chromosome 5q14.3 has been associated with the
occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and intellectual
disability, and MEF2C haploinsufficiency was identified as main cause. Here, we
report that a brain-enriched long non-coding RNA, NDIME, is located near the
MEF2C locus and is required for normal neural differentiation of mouse embryonic 
stem cells (mESCs). NDIME interacts with EZH2, the major component of polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and blocks EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone
H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the Mef2c promoter, promoting MEF2C transcription.
Moreover, the expression levels of both NDIME and MEF2C were strongly
downregulated in the hippocampus of a mouse model of autism, and the
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of NDIME in the hippocampus of
these mice significantly increased MEF2C expression and ameliorated autism-like
behaviors. The results of this study reveal an epigenetic mechanism by which
NDIME regulates MEF2C transcription and neural differentiation and suggest
potential effects and therapeutic approaches of the NDIME/MEF2C axis in autism.

The ER-bound kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1),
regulates the phylogenetically most conserved arm of the unfolded protein
response (UPR). However, the complex biology and pathology regulated by mammalian
IRE1 cannot be fully explained by IRE1's one known, specific RNA target, X
box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) or the RNA substrates of IRE1-dependent RNA
degradation (RIDD) activity. Investigating other specific substrates of IRE1
kinase and RNase activities may illuminate how it performs these diverse
functions in mammalian cells. We report that macrophage IRE1 plays an
unprecedented role in regulating phosphatidylinositide-derived signaling lipid
metabolites and has profound impact on the downstream signaling mediated by the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This cross-talk between UPR and mTOR
pathways occurs through the unconventional maturation of microRNA (miR) 2137 by
IRE1's RNase activity. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) phosphate
(PI(3,4,5)P3 ) 5-phosphatase-2 (INPPL1) is a direct target of miR-2137, which
controls PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in macrophages. The modulation of cellular
PI(3,4,5)P3 /PIP2 ratio and anabolic mTOR signaling by the IRE1-induced miR-2137 
demonstrates how the ER can provide a critical input into cell growth decisions.

The mechanism and regulation of fusion between autophagosomes and
lysosomes/vacuoles are still only partially understood in both yeast and mammals.
In yeast, this fusion step requires SNARE proteins, the homotypic vacuole fusion 
and protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex, the RAB7 GTPase Ypt7, and its
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Mon1-Ccz1. We and others recently
identified Ykt6 as the autophagosomal SNARE protein. However, it has not been
resolved when and how lipid-anchored Ykt6 is recruited onto autophagosomes. Here,
we show that Ykt6 is recruited at an early stage of the formation of these
carriers through a mechanism that depends on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident 
Dsl1 complex and COPII-coated vesicles. Importantly, Ykt6 activity on
autophagosomes is regulated by the Atg1 kinase complex, which inhibits Ykt6
through direct phosphorylation. Thus, our findings indicate that the Ykt6 pool on
autophagosomal membranes is kept inactive by Atg1 phosphorylation, and once an
autophagosome is ready to fuse with vacuole, Ykt6 dephosphorylation allows its
engagement in the fusion event.

The function and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are tightly regulated
by signals originating from their niche environment. Skeletal myofibers are a
principle component of the MuSC niche and are in direct contact with the muscle
stem cells. Here, we show that Myf6 establishes a ligand/receptor interaction
between muscle stem cells and their associated muscle fibers. Our data show that 
Myf6 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of myokines and muscle-secreted
proteins in skeletal myofibers, including EGF. EGFR signaling blocks p38 MAP
kinase-induced differentiation of muscle stem cells. Homozygous deletion of Myf6 
causes a significant reduction in the ability of muscle to produce EGF, leading
to a deregulation in EGFR signaling. Consequently, although Myf6-knockout mice
are born with a normal muscle stem cell compartment, they undergo a progressive
reduction in their stem cell pool during postnatal life due to spontaneous exit
from quiescence. Taken together, our data uncover a novel role for Myf6 in
promoting the expression of key myokines, such as EGF, in the muscle fiber which 
prevents muscle stem cell exhaustion by blocking their premature differentiation.

mascRNA is a small cytoplasmic RNA derived from the lncRNA MALAT1. After being
processed by the tRNA processing enzymes RNase P and RNase Z, mascRNA undergoes
CCA addition like tRNAs and folds into a tRNA-like cloverleaf structure. While
MALAT1 functions in multiple cellular processes, the role of mascRNA was largely 
unknown. Here, we show that mascRNA binds directly to the multi-tRNA synthetase
complex (MSC) component glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QARS). mascRNA promotes
global protein translation and cell proliferation by positively regulating QARS
protein levels. Our results uncover a role of mascRNA that is independent of
MALAT1, but could be part of the molecular mechanism of MALAT1's function in
cancer, and provide a paradigm for understanding tRNA-like structures in
mammalian cells.

Tumor cells subvert immune surveillance by harnessing signals from immune
checkpoints to acquire immune resistance. The protein PD-L1 is an important
component in this process, and inhibition of PD-L1 elicits durable anti-tumor
responses in a broad spectrum of cancers. However, immune checkpoint inhibition
that target known pathways is not universally effective. A better understanding
of the genetic repertoire underlying these processes is necessary to expand our
knowledge in tumor immunity and to facilitate identification of alternative
targets. Here, we present a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human cancer cells to identify 
genes that confer tumors with the ability to evade the cytotoxic effects of the
immune system. We show that the transcriptional regulator MLLT6 (AF17) is
required for efficient PD-L1 protein expression and cell surface presentation in 
cancer cells. MLLT6 depletion alleviates suppression of CD8+ cytotoxic T
cell-mediated cytolysis. Furthermore, cancer cells lacking MLLT6 exhibit impaired
STAT1 signaling and are insensitive to interferon-γ-induced stimulation of IDO1, 
GBP5, CD74, and MHC class II genes. Collectively, our findings establish MLLT6 as
a regulator of oncogenic and interferon-γ-associated immune resistance.

The tumor suppressor Merlin/NF2, a key activator of the Hippo pathway in growth
control, is regulated by phosphorylation. However, it is uncertain whether
additional post-translational modifications regulate Merlin. Here, we show that
ubiquitination is required to activate Merlin in the Hippo pathway. Ubiquitinated
Merlin is mostly conjugated by one or two ubiquitin molecules. Such modification 
is promoted by serine 518 dephosphorylation in response to Ca2+ signaling or cell
detachment. Merlin ubiquitination is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L,
which requires a scaffold protein, AMOTL1, to approach Merlin. Several
NF2-patient-derived Merlin mutations disrupt its binding to AMOTL1 and its
regulation by the AMOTL1-NEDD4L apparatus. Lysine (K) 396 is the major ubiquitin 
conjugation residue. Disruption of Merlin ubiquitination by the K396R mutation or
NEDD4L depletion diminishes its binding to Lats1 and inhibits Lats1 activation.
These effects are also accompanied by loss of Merlin's anti-mitogenic and tumor
suppressive properties. Thus, we propose that dephosphorylation and
ubiquitination compose an intramolecular relay to activate Merlin functions in
activating the Hippo pathway during growth control.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer with a 5-year
overall survival rate of 50%. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the
disease process, and to identify improved therapeutic strategies. Previously, we 
found the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) EGFR long non-coding downstream RNA (ELDR)
induced in a mouse tongue cancer model; however, its functional role in human
oral cancer remained unknown. Here, we show that ELDR is highly expressed in OSCC
patient samples and in cell lines. Overexpression of ELDR in normal
non-tumorigenic oral keratinocytes induces cell proliferation, colony formation, 
and PCNA expression. We also show that ELDR depletion reduces OSCC cell
proliferation and PCNA expression. Proteomics data identifies the RNA binding
protein ILF3 as an interacting partner of ELDR. We further show that the
ELDR-ILF3 axis regulates Cyclin E1 expression and phosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Intratumoral injection of ELDR-specific siRNA
reduces OSCC and PDX tumor growth in mice. These findings provide molecular
insight into the role of ELDR in oral cancer and demonstrate that targeting ELDR 
has promising therapeutic potential.

The retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (RB) regulates a number of diverse
cellular functions including differentiation, angiogenesis, chromatin
remodelling, senescence and apoptosis. The best-characterised function of RB is
cell cycle regulation, and it has been considered a phosphoprotein regulated by
cyclin-dependent kinases. In its hypophosphorylated form, RB binds the
transcription factor E2F1, arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Here, we
show that MDM2 controls the cell cycle through synthesis and degradation of RB
protein in a cell cycle condition-dependent fashion. MDM2 induces G1 cell cycle
arrest by enhancing the translation of the RB mRNA under genotoxic stress.
Translation requires direct interaction between the RB mRNA and the MDM2 protein 
that accompanies the RB mRNA to the polysomes. However, MDM2 ubiquitinates and
degrades RB protein at the G2/M phase under genotoxic stress. The ATM
phosphomimetic mutant MDM2(S395D) corroborates that the effect on the RB levels
is dependent on the DNA damage. These results provide the basis of a dual
regulatory mechanism by which MDM2 controls cell cycle progression during DNA
damage.

Nrf2 signaling is vital for protecting cells against oxidative stress. However,
its hyperactivation is frequently found in liver cancer through excessive
build-up of p62/SQSTM1 bodies that sequester Keap1, an adaptor of the
E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for Nrf2. Here, we report that the Bax-binding
protein MOAP-1 regulates p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signaling through disruption of p62
bodies. Upon induction of cellular stresses that stimulate formation of p62
bodies, MOAP-1 is recruited to p62 bodies and reduces their levels independent of
the autophagy pathway. MOAP-1 interacts with the PB1-ZZ domains of p62 and
interferes with its self-oligomerization and liquid-liquid phase separation,
thereby disassembling the p62 bodies. Loss of MOAP-1 can lead to marked
upregulation of p62 bodies, enhanced sequestration of Keap1 by p62 and
hyperactivation of Nrf2 antioxidant target genes. MOAP-1-deficient mice exhibit
an elevated tumor burden with excessive levels of p62 bodies and Nrf2 signaling
in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model. Together, our

The denitrosylase S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) has been suggested to
sustain mitochondrial removal by autophagy (mitophagy), functionally linking
S-nitrosylation to cell senescence and aging. In this study, we provide evidence 
that GSNOR is induced at the translational level in response to hydrogen peroxide
and mitochondrial ROS. The use of selective pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA 
demonstrates that GSNOR induction is an event downstream of the redox-mediated
activation of ATM, which in turn phosphorylates and activates CHK2 and p53 as
intermediate players of this signaling cascade. The modulation of ATM/GSNOR axis,
or the expression of a redox-insensitive ATM mutant influences cell sensitivity
to nitrosative and oxidative stress, impairs mitophagy and affects cell survival.
Remarkably, this interplay modulates T-cell activation, supporting the conclusion
that GSNOR is a key molecular effector of the antioxidant function of ATM and
providing new clues to comprehend the pleiotropic effects of ATM in the context
of immune function.

Lysine succinylation (Ksucc) is an evolutionarily conserved and widespread
post-translational modification. Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) is a type B
histone acetyltransferase, regulating the acetylation of both histone and
non-histone proteins. However, the role of HAT1 in succinylation modulation
remains unclear. Here, we employ a quantitative proteomics approach to study
succinylation in HepG2 cancer cells and find that HAT1 modulates lysine
succinylation on various proteins including histones and non-histones. HAT1
succinylates histone H3 on K122, contributing to epigenetic regulation and gene
expression in cancer cells. Moreover, HAT1 catalyzes the succinylation of PGAM1
on K99, resulting in its increased enzymatic activity and the stimulation of
glycolytic flux in cancer cells. Clinically, HAT1 is significantly elevated in
liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Functionally,
HAT1 succinyltransferase activity and the succinylation of PGAM1 by HAT1 play
critical roles in promoting tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we
conclude that HAT1 is a succinyltransferase for histones and non-histones in
tumorigenesis.

Dynamic control of ubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes is essential for
almost all biological processes. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is part 
of the SAGA complex and catalyzes the removal of mono-ubiquitination from
histones H2A and H2B, thereby regulating gene transcription. However, novel roles
for USP22 have emerged recently, such as tumor development and cell death. Apart 
from apoptosis, the relevance of USP22 in other programmed cell death pathways
still remains unclear. Here, we describe a novel role for USP22 in controlling
necroptotic cell death in human tumor cell lines. Loss of USP22 expression
significantly delays TNFα/Smac mimetic/zVAD.fmk (TBZ)-induced necroptosis,
without affecting TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation or extrinsic apoptosis.
Ubiquitin remnant profiling identified receptor-interacting protein kinase 3
(RIPK3) lysines 42, 351, and 518 as novel, USP22-regulated ubiquitination sites
during necroptosis. Importantly, mutation of RIPK3 K518 reduced
necroptosis-associated RIPK3 ubiquitination and amplified necrosome formation and
necroptotic cell death. In conclusion, we identify a novel role of USP22 in
necroptosis and further elucidate the relevance of RIPK3 ubiquitination as
crucial regulator of necroptotic cell death.

Sleep homeostasis is crucial for sleep regulation. The role of epigenetic
regulation in sleep homeostasis is unestablished. Previous studies showed that
octopamine is important for sleep homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanism 
of octopamine reception in sleep is unknown. In this study, we identify an
epigenetic regulatory cascade (Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octβ2R) that modulates the
octopamine receptor in Drosophila. We demonstrate that stuxnet positively
regulates Octβ2R through repression of Polycomb in the ellipsoid body of the
adult fly brain and that Octβ2R is one of the major receptors mediating
octopamine function in sleep homeostasis. In response to octopamine, Octβ2R
transcription is inhibited as a result of stuxnet downregulation. This feedback
through the Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octβ2R cascade is crucial for sleep homeostasis
regulation. This study demonstrates a Stuxnet-Polycomb-Octβ2R-mediated epigenetic
regulatory mechanism for octopamine reception, thus providing an example of
epigenetic regulation of sleep homeostasis.

Energy storage and growth are coordinated in response to nutrient status of
animals. How nutrient-regulated signaling pathways control these processes in
vivo remains insufficiently understood. Here, we establish an atypical MAP
kinase, ERK7, as an inhibitor of adiposity and growth in Drosophila. ERK7 mutant 
larvae display elevated triacylglycerol (TAG) stores and accelerated growth rate,
while overexpressed ERK7 is sufficient to inhibit lipid storage and growth. ERK7 
expression is elevated upon fasting and ERK7 mutant larvae display impaired
survival during nutrient deprivation. ERK7 acts in the fat body, the insect
counterpart of liver and adipose tissue, where it controls the subcellular
localization of chromatin-binding protein PWP1, a growth-promoting downstream
effector of mTOR. PWP1 maintains the expression of sugarbabe, encoding a
lipogenic Gli-similar family transcription factor. Both PWP1 and Sugarbabe are
necessary for the increased growth and adiposity phenotypes of ERK7
loss-of-function animals. In conclusion, ERK7 is an anti-anabolic kinase that
inhibits lipid storage and growth while promoting survival on fasting conditions.

Although iron is required for cell proliferation, iron-dependent programmed cell 
death serves as a critical barrier to tumor growth and metastasis. Emerging
evidence suggests that iron-mediated lipid oxidation also facilitates immune
eradication of cancer. However, the regulatory mechanisms of iron metabolism in
cancer remain unclear. Here we identify OTUD1 as the deubiquitinase of
iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IREB2), selectively reduced in
colorectal cancer. Clinically, downregulation of OTUD1 is highly correlated with 
poor outcome of cancer. Mechanistically, OTUD1 promotes transferrin receptor
protein 1 (TFRC)-mediated iron transportation through deubiquitinating and
stabilizing IREB2, leading to increased ROS generation and ferroptosis. Moreover,
the presence of OTUD1 promotes the release of damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), which in turn recruits the leukocytes and strengthens host
immune response. Reciprocally, depletion of OTUD1 limits tumor-reactive T-cell
accumulation and exacerbates colon cancer progression. Our data demonstrate that 
OTUD1 plays a stimulatory role in iron transportation and highlight the
importance of OTUD1-IREB2-TFRC signaling axis in host antitumor immunity.

Metabolic reprogramming of non-cancer cells residing in a tumor microenvironment,
as a result of the adaptations to cancer-derived metabolic and non-metabolic
factors, is an emerging aspect of cancer-host interaction. We show that in normal
and cancer-associated fibroblasts, breast cancer-secreted extracellular vesicles 
suppress mTOR signaling upon amino acid stimulation to globally reduce mRNA
translation. This is through delivery of cancer-derived miR-105 and miR-204,
which target RAGC, a component of Rag GTPases that regulate mTORC1 signaling.
Following amino acid starvation and subsequent re-feeding, 13 C-arginine labeling
of de novo synthesized proteins shows selective translation of proteins that
cluster to specific cellular functional pathways. The repertoire of these newly
synthesized proteins is altered in fibroblasts treated with cancer-derived
extracellular vesicles, in addition to the overall suppressed protein synthesis. 
In human breast tumors, RAGC protein levels are inversely correlated with miR-105
in the stroma. Our results suggest that through educating fibroblasts to reduce
and re-prioritize mRNA translation, cancer cells rewire the metabolic fluxes of
amino acid pool and dynamically regulate stroma-produced proteins during periodic
nutrient fluctuations.

Molecular switches are essential modules in signaling networks and
transcriptional reprogramming. Here, we describe a role for small
ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO as a molecular switch in epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) signaling. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we compare the
endogenous SUMO proteomes of HeLa cells before and after EGF stimulation.
Thereby, we identify a small group of transcriptional coregulators including
IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BPL as novel players in EGFR signaling. Comparison of
cells expressing wild type or SUMOylation-deficient IRF2BP1 indicates that
transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins is important for appropriate
expression of immediate early genes including dual specificity phosphatase 1
(DUSP1, MKP-1) and the transcription factor ATF3. We find that IRF2BP1 is a
repressor, whose transient deSUMOylation on the DUSP1 promoter allows-and whose
timely reSUMOylation restricts-DUSP1 transcription. Our work thus provides a
paradigm how comparative SUMO proteome analyses serve to reveal novel regulators 
in signal transduction and transcription.

Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key players in chromatin
regulation. The identification of novel histone acylations raises important
questions regarding their role in transcription. In this study, we characterize
the role of an acylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer, H3K122
succinylation (H3K122succ), in chromatin function and transcription. Using
chromatin succinylated at H3K122 in in vitro transcription assays, we show that
the presence of H3K122succ is sufficient to stimulate transcription. In line with
this, we found in our ChIP assays H3K122succ enriched on promoters of active
genes and H3K122succ enrichment scaling with gene expression levels. Furthermore,
we show that the co-activators p300/CBP can succinylate H3K122 and identify
sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a new desuccinylase. By applying single molecule FRET
assays, we demonstrate a direct effect of H3K122succ on nucleosome stability,
indicating an important role for histone succinylation in modulating chromatin
dynamics. Together, these data provide the first insights into the mechanisms
underlying transcriptional regulation by H3K122succ.

Amino acid restriction is among promising potential cancer treatment strategies. 
However, cancer cells employ a multitude of mechanisms to mount resistance to
amino acid restriction, which impede the latter's clinical development. Here we
show that MAPK signaling activation in asparagine-restricted melanoma cells
impairs GSK3-β-mediated c-MYC degradation. In turn, elevated c-MYC supports ATF4 
translational induction by enhancing the expression of the amino acid transporter
SLC7A5, increasing the uptake of essential amino acids, and the subsequent
maintenance of mTORC1 activity in asparagine-restricted melanoma cells. Blocking 
the MAPK-c-MYC-SLC7A5 signaling axis cooperates with asparagine restriction to
effectively suppress melanoma cell proliferation. This work reveals a previously 
unknown axis of cancer cell adaptation to asparagine restriction and informs
mechanisms that may be targeted for enhanced therapeutic efficacy of asparagine
limiting strategies.

The eukaryotic replisome is disassembled in each cell cycle, dependent upon
ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase. Studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus laevis have revealed surprising evolutionary
diversity in the ubiquitin ligases that control CMG ubiquitylation, but regulated
disassembly of the mammalian replisome has yet to be explored. Here, we describe 
a model system for studying the ubiquitylation and chromatin extraction of the
mammalian CMG replisome, based on mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that the
ubiquitin ligase CUL2LRR1 is required for ubiquitylation of the CMG-MCM7 subunit 
during S-phase, leading to disassembly by the p97 ATPase. Moreover, a second
pathway of CMG disassembly is activated during mitosis, dependent upon the TRAIP 
ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in primordial dwarfism and mis-regulated in
various cancers. These findings indicate that replisome disassembly in diverse
metazoa is regulated by a conserved pair of ubiquitin ligases, distinct from
those present in other eukaryotes.

Mitophagy is an essential cellular autophagic process that selectively removes
superfluous and damaged mitochondria, and it is coordinated with mitochondrial
biogenesis to fine tune the quantity and quality of mitochondria. Coordination
between these two opposing processes to maintain the functional mitochondrial
network is of paramount importance for normal cellular and organismal metabolism.
However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here we report
that PGC-1α and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), master regulators of
mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic adaptation, also transcriptionally
upregulate the gene encoding FUNDC1, a previously characterized mitophagy
receptor, in response to cold stress in brown fat tissue. NRF1 binds to the
classic consensus site in the promoter of Fundc1 to upregulate its expression and
to enhance mitophagy through its interaction with LC3. Specific knockout of
Fundc1 in BAT results in reduced mitochondrial turnover and accumulation of
functionally compromised mitochondria, leading to impaired adaptive
thermogenesis. Our results demonstrate that FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy is
directly coupled with mitochondrial biogenesis through the PGC-1α/NRF1 pathway,
which dictates mitochondrial quantity, quality, and turnover and contributes to
adaptive thermogenesis.

therapy resistance in melanoma. Reversion of the invasive phenotype, however, is 
challenged by the poor understanding of mechanisms underlying its maintenance.
Here, we report that the lncRNA TINCR is down-regulated in metastatic melanoma
and its silencing increases the expression levels of invasive markers, in vitro
migration, in vivo tumor growth, and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The
critical mediator is ATF4, a central player of the integrated stress response
(ISR), which is activated in TINCR-depleted cells in the absence of starvation
and eIF2α phosphorylation. TINCR depletion increases global protein synthesis and
induces translational reprogramming, leading to increased translation of mRNAs
encoding ATF4 and other ISR proteins. Strikingly, re-expression of TINCR in
metastatic melanoma suppresses the invasive phenotype, reduces numbers of
tumor-initiating cells and metastasis formation, and increases drug sensitivity. 
Mechanistically, TINCR interacts with mRNAs associated with the invasive
phenotype, including ATF4, preventing their binding to ribosomes. Thus, TINCR is 
a suppressor of the melanoma invasive phenotype, which functions in nutrient-rich
conditions by repressing translation of selected ISR RNAs.

The MYC oncoprotein activates and represses gene expression in a
transcription-dependent or transcription-independent manner. Modification of mRNA
emerges as a key gene expression regulatory nexus. We sought to determine whether
MYC alters mRNA modifications and report here that MYC promotes cancer
progression by down-regulating N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) preferentially in
transcripts of a subset of MYC-repressed genes (MRGs). We find that MYC activates
the expression of ALKBH5 and reduces m6 A levels in the mRNA of the selected MRGs
SPI1 and PHF12. We also show that MYC-regulated m6 A controls the translation of 
MRG mRNA via the specific m6 A reader YTHDF3. Finally, we find that inhibition of
ALKBH5, or overexpression of SPI1 or PHF12, effectively suppresses the growth of 
MYC-deregulated B-cell lymphomas, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings uncover
a novel mechanism by which MYC suppresses gene expression by altering m6 A
modifications in selected MRG transcripts promotes cancer progression.

The ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to switch between quiescence and
proliferation is crucial for brain development and homeostasis. Increasing
evidence suggests that variants of histone lysine methyltransferases including
KMT5A are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the function of 
KMT5A/Pr-set7/SETD8 in the central nervous system is not well established. Here, 
we show that Drosophila Pr-Set7 is a novel regulator of NSC reactivation. Loss of
function of pr-set7 causes a delay in NSC reactivation and loss of H4K20
monomethylation in the brain. Through NSC-specific in vivo profiling, we
demonstrate that Pr-set7 binds to the promoter region of cyclin-dependent kinase 
1 (cdk1) and Wnt pathway transcriptional co-activator earthbound1/jerky (ebd1).
Further validation indicates that Pr-set7 is required for the expression of cdk1 
and ebd1 in the brain. Similar to Pr-set7, Cdk1 and Ebd1 promote NSC
reactivation. Finally, overexpression of Cdk1 and Ebd1 significantly suppressed
NSC reactivation defects observed in pr-set7-depleted brains. Therefore, Pr-set7 
promotes NSC reactivation by regulating Wnt signaling and cell cycle progression.
Our findings may contribute to the understanding of mammalian KMT5A/PR-SET7/SETD8
during brain development.

Regulation of mRNA stability and translation plays a critical role in determining
protein abundance within cells. Processing bodies (P-bodies) are critical
regulators of these processes. Here, we report that the Pim1 and 3 protein
kinases bind to the P-body protein enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) and
phosphorylate EDC3 on serine (S)161, thereby modifying P-body assembly. EDC3
phosphorylation is highly elevated in many tumor types, is reduced upon treatment
of cells with kinase inhibitors, and blocks the localization of EDC3 to P-bodies.
Prostate cancer cells harboring an EDC3 S161A mutation show markedly decreased
growth, migration, and invasion in tissue culture and in xenograft models.
Consistent with these phenotypic changes, the expression of integrin β1 and α6
mRNA and protein is reduced in these mutated cells. These results demonstrate
that EDC3 phosphorylation regulates multiple cancer-relevant functions and
suggest that modulation of P-body activity may represent a new paradigm for
cancer treatment.

Notch signaling and epigenetic factors are known to play critical roles in
regulating tissue homeostasis in most multicellular organisms, but how Notch
signaling coordinates with epigenetic modulators to control differentiation
remains poorly understood. Here, we identify heterochromatin protein 1c (HP1c) as
an essential epigenetic regulator of gut homeostasis in Drosophila. Specifically,
we observe that HP1c loss-of-function phenotypes resemble those observed after
Notch signaling perturbation and that HP1c interacts genetically with components 
of the Notch pathway. HP1c represses the transcription of Notch target genes by
directly interacting with Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), the key transcription
factor of Notch signaling. Moreover, phenotypes caused by depletion of HP1c in
Drosophila can be rescued by expressing human HP1γ, suggesting that HP1γ
functions similar to HP1c in Drosophila. Taken together, our findings reveal an
essential role of HP1c in normal development and gut homeostasis by suppressing
Notch signaling.

The tumour suppressors RNF43 and ZNRF3 play a central role in development and
tissue homeostasis by promoting the turnover of the Wnt receptors LRP6 and
Frizzled (FZD). The stem cell growth factor R-spondin induces auto-ubiquitination
and membrane clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 to promote Wnt signalling. However, the
deubiquitinase stabilising ZNRF3/RNF43 at the plasma membrane remains unknown.
Here, we show that the USP42 antagonises R-spondin by protecting ZNRF3/RNF43 from
ubiquitin-dependent clearance. USP42 binds to the Dishevelled interacting region 
(DIR) of ZNRF3 and stalls the R-spondin-LGR4-ZNRF3 ternary complex by
deubiquitinating ZNRF3. Accordingly, USP42 increases the turnover of LRP6 and
Frizzled (FZD) receptors and inhibits Wnt signalling. Furthermore, we show that
USP42 functions as a roadblock for paracrine Wnt signalling in colon cancer cells
and mouse small intestinal organoids. We provide new mechanistic insights into
the regulation R-spondin and conclude that USP42 is crucial for ZNRF3/RNF43
stabilisation at the cell surface.

Treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains challenging due to a
lack of effective targeted therapies. Dysregulated glucose uptake and metabolism 
are essential for TNBC growth. Identifying the molecular drivers and mechanisms
underlying the metabolic vulnerability of TNBC is key to exploiting dysregulated 
cancer metabolism for therapeutic applications. Mitogen-inducible gene-6 (MIG-6) 
has long been thought of as a feedback inhibitor that targets activated EGFR and 
suppresses the growth of tumors driven by constitutive activated mutant EGFR.
Here, our bioinformatics and histological analyses uncover that MIG-6 is
upregulated in TNBC and that MIG-6 upregulation is positively correlated with
poorer clinical outcomes in TNBC. Metabolic arrays and functional assays reveal
that MIG-6 drives glucose metabolism reprogramming toward glycolysis.
Mechanistically, MIG-6 recruits HAUSP deubiquitinase for stabilizing HIF1α
protein expression and the subsequent upregulation of GLUT1 and other
HIF1α-regulated glycolytic genes, substantiating the comprehensive regulation of 
MIG-6 in glucose metabolism. Moreover, our mouse studies demonstrate that MIG-6
regulates GLUT1 expression in tumors and subsequent tumor growth in vivo.
Collectively, this work reveals that MIG-6 is a novel prognosis biomarker,
metabolism regulator, and molecular driver of TNBC.

Replication stress, a major cause of genome instability in cycling cells, is
mainly prevented by the ATR-dependent replication stress response pathway in
somatic cells. However, the replication stress response pathway in embryonic stem
cells (ESCs) may be different due to alterations in cell cycle phase length. The 
transcription factor MYBL2, which is implicated in cell cycle regulation, is
expressed a hundred to a thousand-fold more in ESCs compared with somatic cells. 
Here we show that MYBL2 activates ATM and suppresses replication stress in ESCs. 
Consequently, loss of MYBL2 or inhibition of ATM or Mre11 in ESCs results in
replication fork slowing, increased fork stalling and elevated origin firing.
Additionally, we demonstrate that inhibition of CDC7 activity rescues replication
stress induced by MYBL2 loss and ATM inhibition, suggesting that uncontrolled new
origin firing may underlie the replication stress phenotype resulting from
loss/inhibition of MYBL2 and ATM. Overall, our study proposes that in addition to
ATR, a MYBL2-MRN-ATM replication stress response pathway functions in ESCs to
control DNA replication initiation and prevent genome instability.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can
also be activated by some Group 9/10 transition metals, which is believed to
mediate immune hypersensitivity reactions. In this work, we test whether TLR4 can
be activated by the Group 10 metal platinum and the platinum-based
chemotherapeutic cisplatin. Cisplatin is invaluable in childhood cancer treatment
but its use is limited due to a permanent hearing loss (cisplatin-induced
ototoxicity, CIO) adverse effect. We demonstrate that platinum and cisplatin
activate pathways downstream of TLR4 to a similar extent as the known TLR4
agonists LPS and nickel. We further show that TLR4 is required for
cisplatin-induced inflammatory, oxidative, and cell death responses in hair cells
in vitro and for hair cell damage in vivo. Finally, we identify a TLR4 small
molecule inhibitor able to curtail cisplatin toxicity in vitro. Thus, our
findings indicate that TLR4 is a promising therapeutic target to mitigate CIO.

Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic condensates associated with protein misfolding 
diseases. They sequester stalled mRNAs and signaling factors, such as the mTORC1 
subunit raptor, suggesting that SGs coordinate cell growth during and after
stress. However, the molecular mechanisms linking SG dynamics and signaling
remain undefined. We report that the chaperone Hsp90 is required for SG
dissolution. Hsp90 binds and stabilizes the dual-specificity
tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3) in the cytosol. Upon Hsp90
inhibition, DYRK3 dissociates from Hsp90 and becomes inactive. Inactive DYRK3 is 
subjected to two different fates: it either partitions into SGs, where it is
protected from irreversible aggregation, or it is degraded. In the presence of
Hsp90, DYRK3 is active and promotes SG disassembly, restoring mTORC1 signaling
and translation. Thus, Hsp90 links stress adaptation and cell growth by
regulating the activity of a key kinase involved in condensate disassembly and
translation restoration.

Psoriasis is mainly characterized by abnormal hyperplasia of keratinocytes and
immune cells infiltrating into the dermis and epidermis. Neural precursor cell
expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) is a highly conserved
HECT type E3 ligase that plays an important role in regulating physiological and 
pathological processes. Here, we identify NEDD4L as a negative regulator of
psoriasis. Nedd4l significantly inhibits imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin
hyperplasia, and this effect is attributed to the inhibitory effect of NEDD4L on 
IL-6/GP130 signaling in keratinocytes. Mechanistically, NEDD4L directly interacts
with GP130 and mediates its Lys-27-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. Moreover, the expression of NEDD4L is downregulated in the epidermis
from IMQ-treated mice and psoriasis patients and negatively correlates with the
protein levels of GP130 and p-STAT3 in clinical samples. Collectively, we uncover
an inhibitory role of NEDD4L in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and suggest a new
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of psoriasis.

Dishevelled (DVL) critically regulates Wnt signaling and contributes to a wide
spectrum of diseases and is important in normal and pathophysiological settings. 
However, how it mediates diverse cellular functions remains poorly understood.
Recent discoveries have revealed that constitutive Wnt pathway activation
contributes to breast cancer malignancy, but the mechanisms by which this occurs 
are unknown and very few studies have examined the nuclear role of DVL. Here, we 
have performed DVL3 ChIP-seq analyses and identify novel target genes bound by
DVL3. We show that DVL3 depletion alters KMT2D binding to novel targets and
changes their epigenetic marks and mRNA levels. We further demonstrate that DVL3 
inhibition leads to decreased tumor growth in two different breast cancer models 
in vivo. Our data uncover new DVL3 functions through its regulation of multiple
genes involved in developmental biology, antigen presentation, metabolism,
chromatin remodeling, and tumorigenesis. Overall, our study provides unique
insight into the function of nuclear DVL, which helps to define its role in
mediating aberrant Wnt signaling.

SUMOylation plays a crucial role in regulating diverse cellular processes
including ribosome biogenesis. Proteomic analyses and experimental evidence
showed that a number of nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis are
modified by SUMO. However, how these proteins are SUMOylated in cells is less
understood. Here, we report that USP36, a nucleolar deubiquitinating enzyme
(DUB), promotes nucleolar SUMOylation. Overexpression of USP36 enhances nucleolar
SUMOylation, whereas its knockdown or genetic deletion reduces the levels of
SUMOylation. USP36 interacts with SUMO2 and Ubc9 and directly mediates
SUMOylation in cells and in vitro. We show that USP36 promotes the SUMOylation of
the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) components Nop58 and Nhp2 in cells
and in vitro and their binding to snoRNAs. It also promotes the SUMOylation of
snoRNP components Nop56 and DKC1. Functionally, we show that knockdown of USP36
markedly impairs rRNA processing and translation. Thus, USP36 promotes snoRNP
group SUMOylation and is critical for ribosome biogenesis and protein
translation.

Mutations in the chromatin remodeller-coding gene CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome
(CS). CS features include moderate to severe neurological and behavioural
problems, clinically characterized by intellectual disability,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. To
investigate the poorly characterized neurobiological role of CHD7, we here
generate a zebrafish chd7-/- model. chd7-/- mutants have less GABAergic neurons
and exhibit a hyperactivity behavioural phenotype. The GABAergic neuron defect is
at least in part due to downregulation of the CHD7 direct target gene paqr3b, and
subsequent upregulation of MAPK/ERK signalling, which is also dysregulated in
CHD7 mutant human cells. Through a phenotype-based screen in chd7-/- zebrafish
and Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that the small molecule ephedrine restores
normal levels of MAPK/ERK signalling and improves both GABAergic defects and
behavioural anomalies. We conclude that chd7 promotes paqr3b expression and that 
this is required for normal GABAergic network development. This work provides
insight into the neuropathogenesis associated with CHD7 deficiency and identifies
a promising compound for further preclinical studies.

Pathological TDP-43 aggregation is characteristic of several neurodegenerative
diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD-TDP); however, how TDP-43 aggregation and function are
regulated remain poorly understood. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase
OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 suppresses ALS-associated proteinopathies 
and promotes TDP-43's splicing function. Biochemical and cell-based assays
indicate that OGT's catalytic activity suppresses TDP-43 aggregation and
hyperphosphorylation, whereas abolishment of TDP-43 O-GlcNAcylation impairs its
RNA splicing activity. We further show that TDP-43 mutations in the
O-GlcNAcylation sites improve locomotion defects of larvae and adult flies and
extend adult life spans, following TDP-43 overexpression in Drosophila motor
neurons. We finally demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of TDP-43 promotes proper
splicing of many mRNAs, including STMN2, which is required for normal axonal
outgrowth and regeneration. Our findings suggest that O-GlcNAcylation might be a 
target for the treatment of TDP-43-linked pathogenesis.

Quaking (QKI) proteins belong to the signal transduction and activation of RNA
(STAR) family of RNA-binding proteins that have multiple functions in RNA
biology. Here, we show that QKI-5 is dramatically decreased in metastatic lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD). QKI-5 overexpression inhibits TGF-β-induced
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, whereas QKI-5 knockdown has
the opposite effect. QKI-5 overexpression and silencing suppresses and promotes
TGF-β-stimulated metastasis in vivo, respectively. QKI-5 inhibits TGF-β-induced
EMT and invasion in a TGFβR1-dependent manner. KLF6 knockdown increases TGFβR1
expression and promotes TGF-β-induced EMT, which is partly abrogated by QKI-5
overexpression. Mechanistically, QKI-5 directly interacts with the TGFβR1 3' UTR 
and causes post-transcriptional degradation of TGFβR1 mRNA, thereby inhibiting
TGF-β-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation and TGF-β/SMAD signaling. QKI-5 is positively
regulated by KLF6 at the transcriptional level. In LUAD tissues, KLF6 is lowly
expressed and positively correlated with QKI-5 expression, while TGFβR1
expression is up-regulated and inversely correlated with QKI-5 expression. We
reveal a novel mechanism by which KLF6 transcriptionally regulates QKI-5 and
suggest that targeting the KLF6/QKI-5/TGFβR1 axis is a promising targeting
strategy for metastatic LUAD.

Lysosomal positioning and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling
coordinate cellular responses to nutrient levels. Inadequate nutrient sensing can
result in growth delays, a hallmark of Lowe syndrome. OCRL mutations cause Lowe
syndrome, but the role of OCRL in nutrient sensing is unknown. Here, we show that
OCRL is localized to the centrosome by its ASH domain and that it recruits
microtubule-anchoring factor SSX2IP to the centrosome, which is important in the 
formation of the microtubule-organizing center. Deficiency of OCRL in human and
mouse cells results in loss of microtubule-organizing centers and impaired
microtubule-based lysosome movement, which in turn leads to mTORC1 inactivation
and abnormal nutrient sensing. Centrosome-targeted PACT-SSX2IP can restore
microtubule anchoring and mTOR activity. Importantly, boosting the activity of
mTORC1 restores the nutrient sensing ability of Lowe patients' cells. Our
findings highlight mTORC1 as a novel therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome.

The recruitment of thermogenic brite adipocytes within white adipose tissue
attenuates obesity and metabolic comorbidities, arousing interest in
understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The molecular network of
brite adipogenesis, however, remains largely unresolved. In this light, long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as a versatile class of modulators that control 
many steps within the differentiation machinery. Leveraging the naturally varying
propensities of different inbred mouse strains for white adipose tissue browning,
we identify the nuclear lncRNA Ctcflos as a pivotal orchestrator of thermogenic
gene expression during brite adipocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, Ctcflos 
acts as a pleiotropic regulator, being essential for the transcriptional
recruitment of the early core thermogenic regulatory program and the modulation
of alternative splicing to drive brite adipogenesis. This is showcased by
Ctcflos-regulated gene transcription and splicing of the key browning factor
Prdm16 toward the isoform that is specific for the thermogenic gene program.
Conclusively, our findings emphasize the mechanistic versatility of lncRNAs
acting at several independent levels of gene expression for effective regulation 
of key differentiation factors to direct cell fate and function.

Progression through the cell cycle is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases that
control gene expression, orchestration of mitotic spindle, and cell division. To 
identify new regulators of the cell cycle, we performed transcriptomic analysis
of human non-transformed cells expressing a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell
cycle indicator and identified 701 transcripts differentially expressed in G1 and
G2 cells. Family with sequence similarity 110 member A (FAM110A) protein is
highly expressed in G2 cells and localized at mitotic spindle and spindle poles
during mitosis. Depletion of FAM110A impairs chromosomal alignment, delays
metaphase-to-anaphase transition, and affects spindle positioning. Using mass
spectrometry and immunoprecipitation, we identified casein kinase I (CK1) in
complex with FAM110A during mitosis. CK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of 
FAM110A in vitro, and inhibition of CK1 reduces phosphorylation of mitotic
FAM110A. Wild-type FAM110A, but not the FAM110A-S252-S255A mutant deficient in
CK1 phosphorylation, rescues the chromosomal alignment, duration of mitosis, and 
orientation of the mitotic spindle after depletion of endogenous FAM110A. We
propose that CK1 regulates chromosomal alignment by phosphorylating FAM110A and
promoting its interaction with mitotic spindle.

Dysregulation of lipid metabolism could lead to the development of metabolic
disorders. We report here that the F-box protein JFK promotes excessive lipid
accumulation in adipose tissue and contributes to the development of metabolic
syndrome. JFK transgenic mice develop spontaneous obesity, accompanied by
dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, phenotypes that are further 
exacerbated under high-fat diets. In contrast, Jfk knockout mice are lean and
resistant to diet-induced metabolic malfunctions. Liver-specific reconstitution
of JFK expression in Jfk knockout mice leads to hepatic lipid accumulation
resembling human hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We show 
that JFK interacts with and destabilizes ING5 through assembly of the SCF
complex. Integrative transcriptomic and genomic analysis reveals that the SCFJFK 
-ING5 axis interferes with AMPK activity and fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to
the suppression of hepatic lipid catabolism. Significantly, JFK is upregulated
and AMPKα1 is down-regulated in liver tissues from NAFLD patients. These results 
reveal that SCFJFK is a bona fide E3 ligase for ING5 and link the SCFJFK -ING5
axis to the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Adipose tissue plays a major role in maintaining organismal metabolic
equilibrium. Control over the fate decision from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to
adipocyte differentiation involves coordinated command of phosphorylation.
Protein phosphatase 2A plays an important role in Wnt pathway and adipocyte
development, yet how PP2A complexes actively respond to adipocyte differentiation
signals and acquire specificity in the face of the promiscuous activity of its
catalytic subunit remains unknown. Here, we report the PP2A phosphatase B subunit
B56α is specifically induced during adipocyte differentiation and mediates PP2A
to dephosphorylate GSK3β, thereby blocking Wnt activity and driving adipocyte
differentiation. Using an inducible B56α knock-out mouse, we further demonstrate 
that B56α is essential for gonadal adipose tissue development in vivo and
required for the fate decision of adipocytes over osteoblasts. Moreover, we show 
B56α expression is driven by the adipocyte transcription factor PPARγ thereby
establishing a novel link between PPARγ signaling and Wnt blockade. Overall, our 
results reveal B56α is a necessary part of the machinery dictating the transition
from pre-adipocyte to mature adipocyte and provide fundamental insights into how 
PP2A complex specifically and actively regulates unique signaling pathway in
biology.

RNA-binding protein RBM47 stabilizes IFNAR1 mRNA to potentiate host antiviral
activity.

The type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-α/β)-mediated immune response is the first line
of host defense against invading viruses. IFN-α/β binds to IFN-α/β receptors
(IFNARs) and triggers the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Thus,
stabilization of IFNARs is important for prolonging antiviral activity. Here, we 
report the induction of an RNA-binding motif-containing protein, RBM47, upon
viral infection or interferon stimulation. Using multiple virus infection models,
we demonstrate that RBM47 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and
in vivo. RBM47 has no noticeable impact on IFN production, but significantly
activates the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the expression 
of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, RBM47 binds to the 3'UTR 
of IFNAR1 mRNA, increases mRNA stability, and retards the degradation of IFNAR1. 
In summary, this study suggests that RBM47 is an interferon-inducible RNA-binding
protein that plays an essential role in enhancing host IFN downstream signaling.

The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are implicated as the cause of a prevalent
somatic mutation pattern found in cancer genomes. The APOBEC3 enzymes act as
viral restriction factors by mutating viral genomes. Mutation of the cellular
genome is presumed to be an off-target activity of the enzymes, although the
regulatory measures for APOBEC3 expression and activity remain undefined. It is
therefore difficult to predict circumstances that enable APOBEC3 interaction with
cellular DNA that leads to mutagenesis. The APOBEC3A (A3A) enzyme is the most
potent deaminase of the family. Using proteomics, we evaluate protein interactors
of A3A to identify potential regulators. We find that A3A interacts with the
chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, a cellular machine that assists in
protein folding and function. Importantly, depletion of CCT results in
A3A-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Evaluation of cancer genomes
demonstrates an enrichment of A3A mutational signatures in cancers with silencing
mutations in CCT subunit genes. Together, these data suggest that the CCT complex
interacts with A3A, and that disruption of CCT function results in increased A3A 
mutational activity.

Melanoma cell phenotype switching between differentiated melanocytic and
undifferentiated mesenchymal-like states drives metastasis and drug resistance.
CDK7 is the serine/threonine kinase of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. We
show that dedifferentiation of melanocytic-type melanoma cells into
mesenchymal-like cells and acquisition of tolerance to targeted therapies is
achieved through chronic inhibition of CDK7. In addition to emergence of a
mesenchymal-type signature, we identify a GATA6-dependent gene expression program
comprising genes such as AMIGO2 or ABCG2 involved in melanoma survival or
targeted drug tolerance, respectively. Mechanistically, we show that CDK7 drives 
expression of the melanocyte lineage transcription factor MITF that in turn binds
to an intronic region of GATA6 to repress its expression in melanocytic-type
cells. We show that GATA6 expression is activated in MITF-low melanoma cells of
patient-derived xenografts. Taken together, our data show how the poorly
characterized repressive function of MITF in melanoma participates in a molecular
cascade regulating activation of a transcriptional program involved in survival
and drug resistance in melanoma.

Differentiated cells across multiple species and organs can re-enter the cell
cycle to aid in injury-induced tissue regeneration by a cellular program called
paligenosis. Here, we show that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is
induced early during paligenosis in multiple cellular contexts, transcriptionally
activating the lysosomal trafficking gene Rab7b. ATF3 and RAB7B are upregulated
in gastric and pancreatic digestive-enzyme-secreting cells at the onset of
paligenosis Stage 1, when cells massively induce autophagic and lysosomal
machinery to dismantle differentiated cell morphological features. Their
expression later ebbs before cells enter mitosis during Stage 3. Atf3-/- mice
fail to induce RAB7-positive autophagic and lysosomal vesicles, eventually
causing increased death of cells en route to Stage 3. Finally, we observe that
ATF3 is expressed in human gastric metaplasia and during paligenotic injury
across multiple other organs and species. Thus, our findings indicate ATF3 is an 
evolutionarily conserved gene orchestrating the early paligenotic autodegradative
events that must occur before cells are poised to proliferate and contribute to
tissue repair.

Our knowledge of the coordination of fuel usage in skeletal muscle is incomplete.
Whether and how microRNAs are involved in the substrate selection for oxidation
is largely unknown. Here we show that mice lacking miR-183 and miR-96 have
enhanced muscle oxidative phenotype and altered glucose/lipid homeostasis.
Moreover, loss of miR-183 and miR-96 results in a shift in substrate utilization 
toward fat relative to carbohydrates in mice. Mechanistically, loss of miR-183
and miR-96 suppresses glucose utilization in skeletal muscle by increasing PDHA1 
phosphorylation via targeting FoxO1 and PDK4. On the other hand, loss of miR-183 
and miR-96 promotes fat usage in skeletal muscle by enhancing intramuscular
lipolysis via targeting FoxO1 and ATGL. Thus, our study establishes miR-183 and
miR-96 as master coordinators of fuel selection and metabolic homeostasis owing
to their capability of modulating both glucose utilization and fat catabolism.
Lastly, we show that loss of miR-183 and miR-96 can alleviate obesity and improve
glucose metabolism in high-fat diet-induced mice, suggesting that miR-183 and
miR-96 may serve as therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CDC20-activated anaphase-promoting
complex/Cyclosome (APC/CCDC20 ) plays a critical role in governing mitotic
progression by targeting key cell cycle regulators for degradation. Cell division
cycle protein 20 homolog (CDC20), the co-activator of APC/C, is required for full
ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition to its well-known cell cycle-related
functions, we demonstrate that CDC20 plays an essential role in osteogenic
commitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMSCs). Cdc20
conditional knockout mice exhibit decreased bone formation and impaired bone
regeneration after injury. Mechanistically, we discovered a functional
interaction between the WD40 domain of CDC20 and the DNA-binding domain of p65.
Moreover, CDC20 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p65 in an
APC11-dependent manner. More importantly, knockdown of p65 rescues the bone loss 
in Cdc20 conditional knockout mice. Our current work reveals a cell
cycle-independent function of CDC20, establishes APC11CDC20 as a pivotal
regulator for bone formation by governing the ubiquitination and degradation of
p65, and may pave the way for treatment of bone-related diseases.

ATG9A, the only multi-pass transmembrane protein among core ATG proteins, is an
essential regulator of autophagy, yet its regulatory mechanisms and network of
interactions are poorly understood. Through quantitative BioID proteomics, we
identify a network of ATG9A interactions that includes members of the ULK1
complex and regulators of membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking, including the 
TRAPP, EARP, GARP, exocyst, AP-1, and AP-4 complexes. These interactions mark
pathways of ATG9A trafficking through ER, Golgi, and endosomal systems. In
exploring these data, we find that ATG9A interacts with components of the ULK1
complex, particularly ATG13 and ATG101. Using knockout/reconstitution and
split-mVenus approaches to capture the ATG13-ATG101 dimer, we find that ATG9A
interacts with ATG13-ATG101 independently of ULK1. Deletion of ATG13 or ATG101
causes a shift in ATG9A distribution, resulting in an aberrant accumulation of
ATG9A at stalled clusters of p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitin, which can be rescued by an
ULK1 binding-deficient mutant of ATG13. Together, these data reveal ATG9A
interactions in vesicle-trafficking and autophagy pathways, including a role for 
an ULK1-independent ATG13 complex in regulating ATG9A.

Cytokinins are phytohormones that regulate plant development, growth, and
responses to stress. In particular, cytokinin has been reported to negatively
regulate plant adaptation to high salinity; however, the molecular mechanisms
that counteract cytokinin signaling and enable salt tolerance are not fully
understood. Here, we provide evidence that salt stress induces the degradation of
the cytokinin signaling components Arabidopsis (Arabidopisis thaliana) response
regulator 1 (ARR1), ARR10 and ARR12. Furthermore, the stress-activated
mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MPK3) and MPK6 interact with and
phosphorylate ARR1/10/12 to promote their degradation in response to salt stress.
As expected, salt tolerance is decreased in the mpk3/6 double mutant, but
enhanced upon ectopic MPK3/MPK6 activation in an MKK5DD line. Importantly, salt
hypersensitivity phenotypes of the mpk3/6 line were significantly alleviated by
mutation of ARR1/12. The above results indicate that MPK3/6 enhance salt
tolerance in part via their negative regulation of ARR1/10/12 protein stability. 
Thus, our work reveals a new molecular mechanism underlying salt-induced stress
adaptation and the inhibition of plant growth, via enhanced degradation of
cytokinin signaling components.

Cholesterol is essential for membrane biogenesis, cell proliferation, and
differentiation. The role of cholesterol in cancer development and the regulation
of cholesterol synthesis are still under active investigation. Here we show that 
under normal-sterol conditions, p53 directly represses the expression of SQLE, a 
rate-limiting and the first oxygenation enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, in a
SREBP2-independent manner. Through transcriptional downregulation of SQLE, p53
represses cholesterol production in vivo and in vitro, leading to tumor growth
suppression. Inhibition of SQLE using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
terbinafine (a SQLE inhibitor) reverses the increased cell proliferation caused
by p53 deficiency. Conversely, SQLE overexpression or cholesterol addition
promotes cell proliferation, particularly in p53 wild-type cells. More
importantly, pharmacological inhibition or shRNA-mediated silencing of SQLE
restricts nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-induced liver tumorigenesis in
p53 knockout mice. Therefore, our findings reveal a role for p53 in regulating
SQLE and cholesterol biosynthesis, and further demonstrate that downregulation of
SQLE is critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression.

Alveolar epithelial regeneration is essential for recovery from devastating lung 
diseases. This process occurs when type II alveolar pneumocytes (AT2 cells)
proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar pneumocytes (AT1 cells). 
We used genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression
following acute lung injury to elucidate repair mechanisms. AT2 chromatin
accessibility changed substantially following injury to reveal STAT3 binding
motifs adjacent to genes that regulate essential regenerative pathways.
Single-cell transcriptome analysis identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(Bdnf) as a STAT3 target gene with newly accessible chromatin in a unique
population of regenerating AT2 cells. Furthermore, the BDNF receptor tropomyosin 
receptor kinase B (TrkB) was enriched on mesenchymal alveolar niche cells
(MANCs). Loss or blockade of AT2-specific Stat3, Bdnf or mesenchyme-specific TrkB
compromised repair and reduced Fgf7 expression by niche cells. A TrkB agonist
improved outcomes in vivo following lung injury. These data highlight the
biological and therapeutic importance of the STAT3-BDNF-TrkB axis in
orchestrating alveolar epithelial regeneration.

Cooperation between DNA, RNA and protein regulates gene expression and controls
differentiation through interactions that connect regions of nucleic acids and
protein domains and through the assembly of biomolecular condensates. Here, we
report that endoderm differentiation is regulated by the interaction between the 
long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DIGIT and the bromodomain and extraterminal domain
protein BRD3. BRD3 forms phase-separated condensates of which the formation is
promoted by DIGIT, occupies enhancers of endoderm transcription factors and is
required for endoderm differentiation. BRD3 binds to histone H3 acetylated at
lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in vitro and co-occupies the genome with H3K18ac. DIGIT is
also enriched in regions of H3K18ac, and the depletion of DIGIT results in
decreased recruitment of BRD3 to these regions. Our findings show that
cooperation between DIGIT and BRD3 at regions of H3K18ac regulates the
transcription factors that drive endoderm differentiation and suggest that
protein-lncRNA phase-separated condensates have a broader role as regulators of
transcription.

Although pyroptosis is critical for macrophages against pathogen infection, its
role and mechanism in cancer cells remains unclear. PD-L1 has been detected in
the nucleus, with unknown function. Here we show that PD-L1 switches TNFα-induced
apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells, resulting in tumour necrosis. Under
hypoxia, p-Stat3 physically interacts with PD-L1 and facilitates its nuclear
translocation, enhancing the transcription of the gasdermin C (GSDMC) gene. GSDMC
is specifically cleaved by caspase-8 with TNFα treatment, generating a GSDMC
N-terminal domain that forms pores on the cell membrane and induces pyroptosis.
Nuclear PD-L1, caspase-8 and GSDMC are required for macrophage-derived
TNFα-induced tumour necrosis in vivo. Moreover, high expression of GSDMC
correlates with poor survival. Antibiotic chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis in
breast cancer. These findings identify a non-immune checkpoint function of PD-L1 
and provide an unexpected concept that GSDMC/caspase-8 mediates a non-canonical
pyroptosis pathway in cancer cells, causing tumour necrosis.

Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a devastating disease. Radiation therapy
remains the mainstay for treatment of this disease. Unfortunately, its efficacy
is limited by the dose that can be safely applied. One promising approach to
overcoming this limitation is to sensitize BCBMs to radiation by inhibiting their
ability to repair DNA damage. Here, we report a DNA repair suppressor,
leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 31 (LRRC31), that was identified through a
genome-wide CRISPR screen. We found that overexpression of LRRC31 suppresses DNA 
repair and sensitizes BCBMs to radiation. Mechanistically, LRRC31 interacts with 
Ku70/Ku80 and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at the
protein level, resulting in inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic
subunit (DNA-PKcs) recruitment and activation, and disruption of the MutS
homologue 2 (MSH2)-ATR module. We demonstrate that targeted delivery of the
LRRC31 gene via nanoparticles improves the survival of tumour-bearing mice after 
irradiation. Collectively, our study suggests LRRC31 as a major DNA repair
suppressor that can be targeted for cancer radiosensitizing therapy.

Dystrophin proteomic regulation in muscular dystrophies (MDs) remains unclear. We
report that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), H19, associates with dystrophin and
inhibits E3-ligase-dependent polyubiquitination at Lys 3584 (referred to as
Ub-DMD) and its subsequent protein degradation. In-frame deletions in BMD and a
DMD non-silent mutation (C3340Y) resulted in defects in the ability of the
protein to interact with H19, which caused elevated Ub-DMD levels and dystrophin 
degradation. Dmd C3333Y mice exhibited progressive MD, elevated serum creatine
kinase, heart dilation, blood vessel irregularity and respiratory failure with
concurrently reduced dystrophin and increased Ub-DMD status. H19 RNA
oligonucleotides conjugated with agrin (AGR-H19) and nifenazone competed with or 
inhibited TRIM63. Dmd C3333Y animals, induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived
skeletal muscle cells from patients with Becker MD and mdx mice subjected to exon
skipping exhibited inhibited dystrophin degradation, preserved skeletal and
cardiac muscle histology, and improved strength and heart function following
AGR-H19 or nifenazone treatment. Our study paves the way for meaningful targeted 
therapeutics for Becker MD and for certain patients with Duchenne MD.

Cardiomyocyte loss after injury results in adverse remodelling and fibrosis,
inevitably leading to heart failure. The ERBB2-Neuregulin and Hippo-YAP
signalling pathways are key mediators of heart regeneration, yet the crosstalk
between them is unclear. We demonstrate that transient overexpression of
activated ERBB2 in cardiomyocytes (OE CMs) promotes cardiac regeneration in a
heart failure model. OE CMs present an epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-like regenerative response manifested by cytoskeletal remodelling, junction
dissolution, migration and extracellular matrix turnover. We identified YAP as a 
critical mediator of ERBB2 signalling. In OE CMs, YAP interacts with
nuclear-envelope and cytoskeletal components, reflecting an altered mechanical
state elicited by ERBB2. We identified two YAP-activating phosphorylations on
S352 and S274 in OE CMs, which peak during metaphase, that are ERK dependent and 
Hippo independent. Viral overexpression of YAP phospho-mutants dampened the
proliferative competence of OE CMs. Together, we reveal a potent ERBB2-mediated
YAP mechanotransduction signalling, involving EMT-like characteristics, resulting
in robust heart regeneration.

The canonical model of agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase
(PI3K)-Akt signalling proposes that PI3K is activated at the plasma membrane,
where receptors are activated and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate is
concentrated. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
generation and activated Akt are instead largely confined to intracellular
membranes upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Microtubule-associated
protein 4 (MAP4) interacts with and controls localization of membrane
vesicle-associated PI3Kα to microtubules. The microtubule-binding domain of MAP4 
binds directly to the C2 domain of the p110α catalytic subunit. MAP4 controls the
interaction of PI3Kα with activated receptors at endosomal compartments along
microtubules. Loss of MAP4 results in the loss of PI3Kα targeting and loss of
PI3K-Akt signalling downstream of multiple agonists. The MAP4-PI3Kα assembly
defines a mechanism for spatial control of agonist-stimulated PI3K-Akt signalling
at internal membrane compartments linked to the microtubule network.

The Hippo pathway plays critical roles in cell growth, differentiation, organ
development and tissue homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation can lead to
tumorigenesis. YAP and TAZ are transcription co-activators and represent the main
downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Here, we show that heat stress induces
a strong and rapid YAP dephosphorylation and activation. The effect of heat shock
on YAP is dominant to other signals known to modulate the Hippo pathway. Heat
shock inhibits LATS kinase by promoting HSP90-dependent LATS interaction with and
inactivation by protein phosphatase 5. Heat shock also induces LATS
ubiquitination and degradation. YAP and TAZ are crucial for cellular heat shock
responses, including the heat shock transcriptome and cell viability. This study 
uncovers previously unknown mechanisms of Hippo regulation by heat shock, as well
as physiological functions of YAP, in the heat stress response. Our observations 
also reveal a potential combinational therapy involving hyperthermia and
targeting of the Hippo pathway.

Nutrient availability is central for T-cell functions and immune responses. Here 
we report that CD8+ T-cell activation and anti-tumour responses are strongly
potentiated by the non-essential amino acid Asn. Increased Asn levels enhance
CD8+ T-cell activation and effector functions against tumour cells in vitro and
in vivo. Conversely, restriction of dietary Asn, ASNase administration or
inhibition of the Asn transporter SLC1A5 impairs the activity and responses of
CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, Asn does not directly alter cellular metabolic
fluxes; it instead binds the SRC-family protein tyrosine kinase LCK and
orchestrates LCK phosphorylation at Tyr 394 and 505, thereby leading to enhanced 
LCK activity and T-cell-receptor signalling. Thus, our findings reveal a critical
and metabolism-independent role for Asn in the direct modulation of the adaptive 
immune response by controlling T-cell activation and efficacy, and further
uncover that LCK is a natural Asn sensor signalling Asn sufficiency to T-cell
functions.

In patients with advanced-stage cancer, cancer-associated anorexia affects
treatment success and patient survival. However, the underlying mechanism is
poorly understood. Here, we show that Dilp8, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian 
insulin-like 3 peptide (INSL3), is secreted from tumour tissues and induces
anorexia through the Lgr3 receptor in the brain. Activated Dilp8-Lgr3 signalling 
upregulated anorexigenic nucleobinding 1 (NUCB1) and downregulated orexigenic
short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF expression in the brain. In the cancer
condition, the protein expression of Lgr3 and NUCB1 was significantly upregulated
in neurons expressing sNPF and NPF. INSL3 levels were increased in
tumour-implanted mice and INSL3-treated mouse hypothalamic cells showed Nucb2
upregulation and Npy downregulation. Food consumption was significantly reduced
in intracerebrospinal INSL3-injected mice. In patients with pancreatic cancer,
higher serum INSL3 levels increased anorexia. These results indicate that
tumour-derived Dilp8/INSL3 induces cancer anorexia by regulating feeding hormones
through the Lgr3/Lgr8 receptor in Drosophila and mammals.

The complexity of intracellular signalling requires both a diversity of molecular
players and the sequestration of activity to unique compartments within the cell.
Recent findings on the role of liquid-liquid phase separation provide a distinct 
mechanism for the spatial segregation of proteins to regulate signalling pathway 
crosstalk. Here, we discover that DACT1 is induced by TGFβ and forms protein
condensates in the cytoplasm to repress Wnt signalling. These condensates do not 
localize to any known organelles but, rather, exist as phase-separated
proteinaceous cytoplasmic bodies. The deletion of intrinsically disordered
domains within the DACT1 protein eliminates its ability to both form protein
condensates and suppress Wnt signalling. Isolation and mass spectrometry analysis
of these particles revealed a complex of protein machinery that sequesters casein
kinase 2-a Wnt pathway activator. We further demonstrate that DACT1 condensates
are maintained in vivo and that DACT1 is critical to breast and prostate cancer
bone metastasis.

The sympathetic nervous system-catecholamine-uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) axis
plays an essential role in non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis. However, whether
there exists a direct effector that physically connects catecholamine signalling 
to UCP1 in response to acute cold is unknown. Here we report that outer
mitochondrial membrane-located AIDA is phosphorylated at S161 by the
catecholamine-activated protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylated AIDA translocates 
to the intermembrane space, where it binds to and activates the uncoupling
activity of UCP1 by promoting cysteine oxidation of UCP1. Adipocyte-specific
depletion of AIDA abrogates UCP1-dependent thermogenesis, resulting in
hypothermia during acute cold exposure. Re-expression of S161A-AIDA, unlike
wild-type AIDA, fails to restore the acute cold response in Aida-knockout mice.
The PKA-AIDA-UCP1 axis is highly conserved in mammals, including hibernators.
Denervation of the sympathetic postganglionic fibres abolishes cold-induced
AIDA-dependent thermogenesis. These findings uncover a direct mechanistic link
between sympathetic input and UCP1-mediated adaptive thermogenesis.

Activated EGFR signalling drives tumorigenicity in 50% of glioblastoma (GBM).
However, EGFR-targeting therapy has proven ineffective in treating patients with 
GBM, indicating that there is redundant EGFR activation. Circular RNAs are
covalently closed RNA transcripts that are involved in various physiological and 
pathological processes. Herein, we report an additional activation mechanism of
EGFR signalling in GBM by an undescribed secretory E-cadherin protein variant
(C-E-Cad) encoded by a circular E-cadherin (circ-E-Cad) RNA through
multiple-round open reading frame translation. C-E-Cad is overexpressed in GBM
and promotes glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. C-E-Cad activates EGFR independent 
of EGF through association with the EGFR CR2 domain using a unique 14-amino-acid 
carboxy terminus, thereby maintaining glioma stem cell tumorigenicity. Notably,
inhibition of C-E-Cad markedly enhances the antitumour activity of therapeutic
anti-EGFR strategies in GBM. Our results uncover a critical role of C-E-Cad in
stimulating EGFR signalling and provide a promising approach for treating
EGFR-driven GBM.

Dysregulated translation is a common feature of cancer. Uncovering its governing 
factors and underlying mechanism are important for cancer therapy. Here, we
report that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), previously known as a
transcription repressor and lysine methyltransferase, can directly interact with 
fibrillarin (FBL) to exert its role in translational regulation. We demonstrate
that EZH2 enhances rRNA 2'-O methylation via its direct interaction with FBL.
Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the FBL-NOP56 interaction and facilitates the
assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Strikingly, EZH2
deficiency impairs the translation process globally and reduces internal ribosome
entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation in cancer cells. Our findings 
reveal a previously unrecognized role of EZH2 in cancer-related translational
regulation.

Endothelial cells (ECs) adapt their metabolism to enable the growth of new blood 
vessels, but little is known how ECs regulate metabolism to adopt a quiescent
state. Here, we show that the metabolite S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG) plays a
crucial role in the regulation of endothelial quiescence. We find that S-2HG is
produced in ECs after activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O1
(FOXO1), where it limits cell cycle progression, metabolic activity and vascular 
expansion. FOXO1 stimulates S-2HG production by inhibiting the mitochondrial
enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition relies on branched-chain
amino acid catabolites such as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, which increase in ECs with
activated FOXO1. Treatment of ECs with 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate elicits S-2HG
production and suppresses proliferation, causing vascular rarefaction in mice.
Our findings identify a metabolic programme that promotes the acquisition of a
quiescent endothelial state and highlight the role of metabolites as signalling
molecules in the endothelium.

Cells employ transcription-coupled repair (TCR) to eliminate
transcription-blocking DNA lesions. DNA damage-induced binding of the
TCR-specific repair factor CSB to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) triggers RNAPII
ubiquitylation of a single lysine (K1268) by the CRL4CSA ubiquitin ligase. How
CRL4CSA is specifically directed towards K1268 is unknown. Here, we identify
ELOF1 as the missing link that facilitates RNAPII ubiquitylation, a key signal
for the assembly of downstream repair factors. This function requires its
constitutive interaction with RNAPII close to K1268, revealing ELOF1 as a
specificity factor that binds and positions CRL4CSA for optimal RNAPII
ubiquitylation. Drug-genetic interaction screening also revealed a
CSB-independent pathway in which ELOF1 prevents R-loops in active genes and
protects cells against DNA replication stress. Our study offers key insights into
the molecular mechanisms of TCR and provides a genetic framework of the interplay
between transcriptional stress responses and DNA replication.

The YAP/TAZ transcriptional programme is not only a well-established driver of
cancer progression and metastasis but also an important stimulator of tissue
regeneration. Here we identified Cerebral cavernous malformations 3 (CCM3) as a
regulator of mechanical cue-driven YAP/TAZ signalling, controlling both tumour
progression and stem cell differentiation. We demonstrate that CCM3 localizes to 
focal adhesion sites in cancer-associated fibroblasts, where it regulates
mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. Mechanistically, CCM3 and focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) mutually compete for binding to paxillin to fine-tune
FAK/Src/paxillin-driven mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ activation. In mouse
models of breast cancer, specific loss of CCM3 in cancer-associated fibroblasts
leads to exacerbated tissue remodelling and force transmission to the matrix,
resulting in reciprocal YAP/TAZ activation in the neighbouring tumour cells and
dissemination of metastasis to distant organs. Similarly, CCM3 regulates the
differentiation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. In conclusion, CCM3 is a
gatekeeper in focal adhesions that controls mechanotransduction and YAP/TAZ
signalling.

Inflammatory bowel diseases present with elevated levels of intestinal epithelial
cell (IEC) death, which compromises the gut barrier, activating immune cells and 
triggering more IEC death. The endogenous signals that prevent IEC death and
break this vicious cycle, allowing resolution of intestinal inflammation, remain 
largely unknown. Here we show that prostaglandin E2 signalling via the E-type
prostanoid receptor 4 (EP4) on IECs represses epithelial necroptosis and induces 
resolution of colitis. We found that EP4 expression correlates with an improved
IBD outcome and that EP4 activation induces a transcriptional signature
consistent with resolution of intestinal inflammation. We further show that
dysregulated necroptosis prevents resolution, and EP4 agonism suppresses
necroptosis in human and mouse IECs. Mechanistically, EP4 signalling on IECs
converges on receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 to suppress tumour necrosis
factor-induced activation and membrane translocation of the necroptosis effector 
mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase. In summary, our study indicates
that EP4 promotes the resolution of colitis by suppressing IEC necroptosis.

The shieldin complex functions as the downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 to
promote DNA double-strand break end-joining by restricting end resection. The
SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA ends and blocks end resection through 
OB-fold domains. Besides blocking end resection, it is unclear how the shieldin
complex processes SHLD2-bound single-stranded DNA and promotes non-homologous
end-joining. Here, we identify a downstream effector of the shieldin complex,
ASTE1, as a structure-specific DNA endonuclease that specifically cleaves
single-stranded DNA and 3' overhang DNA. ASTE1 localizes to DNA damage sites in a
shieldin-dependent manner. Loss of ASTE1 impairs non-homologous end-joining,
leads to hyper-resection and causes defective immunoglobulin class switch
recombination. ASTE1 deficiency also causes resistance to poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cells owing to restoration of homologous
recombination. These findings suggest that ASTE1-mediated 3' single-stranded DNA 
end cleavage contributes to the control of DSB repair choice by 53BP1, RIF1 and
shieldin.

The extracellular-signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (hereafter ERK1/2)
represent the foremost mitogenic pathway in mammalian cells, and their
dysregulation drives tumorigenesis and confers therapeutic resistance. ERK1/2 are
known to be activated by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-mediated phosphorylation. Here, we
show that ERK1/2 are also modified by lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin
chains. We identify the tripartite motif-containing protein TRIM15 as a ubiquitin
ligase and the tumour suppressor CYLD as a deubiquitinase of ERK1/2. TRIM15 and
CYLD regulate ERK ubiquitination at defined lysine residues through mutually
exclusive interactions as well as opposing activities. K63-linked
polyubiquitination enhances ERK interaction with and activation by MEK.
Downregulation of TRIM15 inhibits the growth of both drug-responsive and
drug-resistant melanomas. Moreover, high TRIM15 expression and low CYLD
expression are associated with poor prognosis of patients with melanoma. These
findings define a role of K63-linked polyubiquitination in the ERK signalling
pathway and suggest a potential target for cancer therapy.

(p)ppGpp is a nucleotide messenger universally produced in bacteria following
nutrient starvation. In E. coli, ppGpp inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis by
targeting several different enzymes, but the physiological significance of their 
inhibition is unknown. Here, we report the structural basis of inhibition for one
target, Gsk, the inosine-guanosine kinase. Gsk creates an unprecedented,
allosteric binding pocket for ppGpp by restructuring terminal sequences, which
restrains conformational dynamics necessary for catalysis. Guided by this
structure, we generated a chromosomal mutation that abolishes Gsk regulation by
ppGpp. This mutant strain accumulates abnormally high levels of purine
nucleotides following amino-acid starvation, compromising cellular fitness. We
demonstrate that this unrestricted increase in purine nucleotides is detrimental 
because it severely depletes pRpp and essential, pRpp-derived metabolites,
including UTP, histidine, and tryptophan. Thus, our results reveal the
significance of ppGpp's regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and a critical 
mechanism by which E. coli coordinates biosynthetic processes during starvation.

Immune cell function depends on specific metabolic programs dictated by
mitochondria, including nutrient oxidation, macromolecule synthesis, and
post-translational modifications. Mitochondrial adaptations have been linked to
acute and chronic inflammation, but the metabolic cues and precise mechanisms
remain unclear. Here we reveal that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is essential
for shaping mitochondrial adaptations for IL-1β production in macrophages through
non-histone deacetylation. In vivo, HDAC3 promoted lipopolysaccharide-induced
acute inflammation and high-fat diet-induced chronic inflammation by enhancing
NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation. HDAC3 configured the lipid profile in
stimulated macrophages and restricted fatty acid oxidation (FAO) supported by
exogenous fatty acids for mitochondria to acquire their adaptations and
depolarization. Rather than affecting nuclear gene expression, HDAC3 translocated
to mitochondria to deacetylate and inactivate an FAO enzyme, mitochondrial
trifunctional enzyme subunit α. HDAC3 may serve as a controlling node that
balances between acquiring mitochondrial adaptations and sustaining their fitness
for IL-1β-dependent inflammation.

Cancer metastasis accounts for the major cause of cancer-related deaths. How
disseminated cancer cells cope with hostile microenvironments in secondary site
for full-blown metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we show that AMPK
(AMP-activated protein kinase), activated in mouse metastasis models, drives
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) activation to maintain TCA cycle
(tricarboxylic acid cycle) and promotes cancer metastasis by adapting cancer
cells to metabolic and oxidative stresses. This AMPK-PDHc axis is activated in
advanced breast cancer and predicts poor metastasis-free survival.
Mechanistically, AMPK localizes in the mitochondrial matrix and phosphorylates
the catalytic alpha subunit of PDHc (PDHA) on two residues S295 and S314, which
activates the enzymatic activity of PDHc and alleviates an inhibitory
phosphorylation by PDHKs, respectively. Importantly, these phosphorylation events
mediate PDHc function in cancer metastasis. Our study reveals that AMPK-mediated 
PDHA phosphorylation drives PDHc activation and TCA cycle to empower cancer cells
adaptation to metastatic microenvironments for metastasis.

Necroptosis induction in vitro often requires caspase-8 (Casp8) inhibition by
zVAD because pro-Casp8 cleaves RIP1 to disintegrate the necrosome. It has been
unclear how the Casp8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. Here, we
show that pro-Casp8 within the necrosome can be inactivated by phosphorylation at
Thr265 (pC8T265). pC8T265 occurs in vitro in various necroptotic cells and in the
cecum of TNF-treated mice. p90 RSK is the kinase of pro-Casp8. It is activated by
a mechanism that does not need ERK but PDK1, which is recruited to the
RIP1-RIP3-MLKL-containing necrosome. Phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 can
substitute for zVAD to permit necroptosis in vitro. pC8T265 mimic T265E knockin
mice are embryonic lethal due to unconstrained necroptosis, and the
pharmaceutical inhibition of RSK-mediated pC8T265 diminishes TNF-induced cecum
damage and lethality in mice by halting necroptosis. Thus, phosphorylation of
pro-Casp8 at Thr265 by RSK is an intrinsic mechanism for passing the Casp8
checkpoint of necroptosis.

Stabilization of stalled replication forks is a prominent mechanism of PARP
(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase) inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA-deficient
tumors. Epigenetic mechanisms of replication fork stability are emerging but
remain poorly understood. Here, we report the histone acetyltransferase PCAF
(p300/CBP-associated) as a fork-associated protein that promotes fork degradation
in BRCA-deficient cells by acetylating H4K8 at stalled replication forks, which
recruits MRE11 and EXO1. A H4K8ac binding domain within MRE11/EXO1 is required
for their recruitment to stalled forks. Low PCAF levels, which we identify in a
subset of BRCA2-deficient tumors, stabilize stalled forks, resulting in PARPi
resistance in BRCA-deficient cells. Furthermore, PCAF activity is tightly
regulated by ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which phosphorylates
PCAF on serine 264 (S264) to limit its association and activity at stalled forks.
Our results reveal PCAF and histone acetylation as critical regulators of fork
stability and PARPi responses in BRCA-deficient cells, which provides key
insights into targeting BRCA-deficient tumors and identifying epigenetic
modulators of chemotherapeutic responses.

Efficient release of promoter-proximally paused RNA Pol II into productive
elongation is essential for gene expression. Recently, we reported that the
Integrator complex can bind paused RNA Pol II and drive premature transcription
termination, potently attenuating the activity of target genes. Premature
termination requires RNA cleavage by the endonuclease subunit of Integrator, but 
the roles of other Integrator subunits in gene regulation have yet to be
elucidated. Here we report that Integrator subunit 8 (IntS8) is critical for
transcription repression and required for association with protein phosphatase 2A
(PP2A). We find that Integrator-bound PP2A dephosphorylates the RNA Pol II
C-terminal domain and Spt5, preventing the transition to productive elongation.
Thus, blocking PP2A association with Integrator stimulates pause release and gene
activity. These results reveal a second catalytic function associated with
Integrator-mediated transcription termination and indicate that control of
productive elongation involves active competition between transcriptional kinases
and phosphatases.

While effective anti-cancer drugs targeting the CHK1 kinase are advancing in the 
clinic, drug resistance is rapidly emerging. Here, we demonstrate that
CRISPR-mediated knockout of the little-known gene FAM122A/PABIR1 confers cellular
resistance to CHK1 inhibitors (CHK1is) and cross-resistance to ATR inhibitors.
Knockout of FAM122A results in activation of PP2A-B55α, a phosphatase that
dephosphorylates the WEE1 protein and rescues WEE1 from ubiquitin-mediated
degradation. The resulting increase in WEE1 protein expression reduces
replication stress, activates the G2/M checkpoint, and confers cellular
resistance to CHK1is. Interestingly, in tumor cells with oncogene-driven
replication stress, CHK1 can directly phosphorylate FAM122A, leading to
activation of the PP2A-B55α phosphatase and increased WEE1 expression. A
combination of a CHK1i plus a WEE1 inhibitor can overcome CHK1i resistance of
these tumor cells, thereby enhancing anti-cancer activity. The FAM122A expression
level in a tumor cell can serve as a useful biomarker for predicting CHK1i
sensitivity or resistance.

The ubiquitin system regulates the DNA damage response (DDR) by modifying histone
H2A at Lys15 (H2AK15ub) and triggering downstream signaling events. Here, we find
that phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 (pUbT12) controls the DDR by
inhibiting the function of 53BP1, a key factor for DNA double-strand break repair
by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Detectable as a chromatin modification on
H2AK15ub, pUbT12 accumulates in nuclear foci and is increased upon DNA damage.
Mutating Thr12 prevents the removal of ubiquitin from H2AK15ub by USP51
deubiquitinating enzyme, leading to a pronounced accumulation of ubiquitinated
chromatin. Chromatin modified by pUbT12 is inaccessible to 53BP1 but permissive
to the homologous recombination (HR) proteins RNF169, RAD51, and the BRCA1/BARD1 
complex. Phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Thr12 in the chromatin context is a new 
histone mark, H2AK15pUbT12, that regulates the DDR by hampering the activity of
53BP1 at damaged chromosomes.

Amino-acid-induced lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
localization through the Rag GTPases is a critical step for its activation by
Rheb GTPase. However, how the mTORC1 interacts with Rheb on the lysosome remains 
elusive. We report that amino acids enhance the polyubiquitination of Rheb
(Ub-Rheb), which shows a strong binding preference for mTORC1 and supports its
activation, while the Ub-Rheb is subjected to subsequent degradation.
Mechanistically, we identified ATXN3 as a Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal 
localization is blocked by active Rag heterodimer in response to amino acid
stimulation. Consistently, cells lacking functional Rag heterodimer on the
lysosome accumulate Ub-Rheb, and blockade of its degradation instigates robust
lysosomal mTORC1 localization and its activation without the Ragulator-Rag
system. Thus, polyubiquitination of Rheb is an important post-translational
modification, which facilitates the binding of mTORC1 to Rheb on the lysosome and
is another crosstalk between the amino acid and growth factor signaling for
mTORC1 activation.

Although TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, the
p53-dependent transcriptional programs mediating tumor suppression remain
incompletely understood. Here, to uncover critical components downstream of p53
in tumor suppression, we perform unbiased RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic
screens in vivo. These screens converge upon the p53-inducible gene Zmat3,
encoding an RNA-binding protein, and we demonstrate that ZMAT3 is an important
tumor suppressor downstream of p53 in mouse KrasG12D-driven lung and liver
cancers and human carcinomas. Integrative analysis of the ZMAT3 RNA-binding
landscape and transcriptomic profiling reveals that ZMAT3 directly modulates exon
inclusion in transcripts encoding proteins of diverse functions, including the
p53 inhibitors MDM4 and MDM2, splicing regulators, and components of varied
cellular processes. Interestingly, these exons are enriched in NMD signals, and, 
accordingly, ZMAT3 broadly affects target transcript stability. Collectively,
these studies reveal ZMAT3 as a novel RNA-splicing and homeostasis regulator and 
a key component of p53-mediated tumor suppression.

Extracellular 2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by
diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING
pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across
human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels,
better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely expressed cGAMP
transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on
their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2'3'-cyclic dinucleotides. 
In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is
effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical
gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, 
strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine
1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated 
cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting
primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when
activated.

Aberrant mitophagy has been implicated in a broad spectrum of disorders. PINK1,
Parkin, and ubiquitin have pivotal roles in priming mitophagy. However, the
entire regulatory landscape and the precise control mechanisms of mitophagy
remain to be elucidated. Here, we uncover fundamental mitophagy regulation
involving PINK1 and a non-canonical role of the mitochondrial Tu translation
elongation factor (TUFm). The mitochondrion-cytosol dual-localized TUFm interacts
with PINK1 biochemically and genetically, which is an evolutionarily conserved
Parkin-independent route toward mitophagy. A PINK1-dependent TUFm phosphoswitch
at Ser222 determines conversion from activating to suppressing mitophagy. PINK1
modulates differential translocation of TUFm because p-S222-TUFm is restricted
predominantly to the cytosol, where it inhibits mitophagy by impeding Atg5-Atg12 
formation. The self-antagonizing feature of PINK1/TUFm is critical for the
robustness of mitophagy regulation, achieved by the unique kinetic parameters of 
p-S222-TUFm, p-S65-ubiquitin, and their common kinase PINK1. Our findings provide
new mechanistic insights into mitophagy and mitophagy-associated disorders.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification and is installed 
by the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP methyltransferase complex. Although the importance of 
m6A methylation in mRNA metabolism has been well documented recently, regulation 
of the m6A machinery remains obscure. Through a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we
identify the ERK pathway and USP5 as positive regulators of the m6A deposition.
We find that ERK phosphorylates METTL3 at S43/S50/S525 and WTAP at S306/S341,
followed by deubiquitination by USP5, resulting in stabilization of the m6A
methyltransferase complex. Lack of METTL3/WTAP phosphorylation reduces decay of
m6A-labeled pluripotent factor transcripts and traps mouse embryonic stem cells
in the pluripotent state. The same phosphorylation can also be found in
ERK-activated human cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Our study
reveals an unrecognized function of ERK in regulating m6A methylation.

Mitochondrial morphology shifts rapidly to manage cellular metabolism, organelle 
integrity, and cell fate. It remains unknown whether innate nucleic acid sensing,
the central and general mechanisms of monitoring both microbial invasion and
cellular damage, can reprogram and govern mitochondrial dynamics and function.
Here, we unexpectedly observed that upon activation of RIG-I-like receptor
(RLR)-MAVS signaling, TBK1 directly phosphorylated DRP1/DNM1L, which disabled
DRP1, preventing its high-order oligomerization and mitochondrial fragmentation
function. The TBK1-DRP1 axis was essential for assembly of large MAVS aggregates 
and healthy antiviral immunity and underlay nutrient-triggered mitochondrial
dynamics and cell fate determination. Knockin (KI) strategies mimicking TBK1-DRP1
signaling produced dominant-negative phenotypes reminiscent of human DRP1 inborn 
mutations, while interrupting the TBK1-DRP1 connection compromised antiviral
responses. Thus, our findings establish an unrecognized function of innate
immunity governing both morphology and physiology of a major organelle, identify 
a lacking loop during innate RNA sensing, and report an elegant mechanism of
shaping mitochondrial dynamics.

Locus control region (LCR) functions define cellular identity and have critical
roles in diseases such as cancer, although the hierarchy of structural components
and associated factors that drive functionality are incompletely understood. Here
we show that OCA-B, a B cell-specific coactivator essential for germinal center
(GC) formation, forms a ternary complex with the lymphoid-enriched OCT2 and
GC-specific MEF2B transcription factors and that this complex occupies and
activates an LCR that regulates the BCL6 proto-oncogene and is uniquely required 
by normal and malignant GC B cells. Mechanistically, through OCA-B-MED1
interactions, this complex is required for Mediator association with the BCL6
promoter. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only LCR segments
heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for its function. Our results
demonstrate how an intimately linked complex of lineage- and stage-specific
factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the
function of a cell-type-defining LCR.

The anti-tumor potency of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) 
has been linked to trapping of PARP1 on damaged chromatin. However, little is
known about their impact on PARP2, an isoform with overlapping functions at DNA
lesions. Whether the release of PARP1/2 from DNA lesions is actively catalyzed by
molecular machines is also not known. We found that PARPis robustly trap PARP2
and that the helicase ALC1 (CHD1L) is strictly required for PARP2 release.
Catalytic inactivation of ALC1 quantitatively traps PARP2 but not PARP1. ALC1
manipulation impacts the response to single-strand DNA breaks through PARP2
trapping, potentiates PARPi-induced cancer cell killing, and mediates synthetic
lethality upon BRCA deficiency. The chromatin remodeler ALC1 actively drives
PARP2 turnover from DNA lesions, and PARP2 contributes to the cellular responses 
of PARPi. This suggests that disrupting the ATP-fueled remodeling forces of ALC1 
might enable therapies that selectively target the DNA repair functions of PARPs 
in cancer.

    Cell Calcium. 2021 Mar;94:102340.

Mechanisms that control mobilization of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i are key for
regulation of numerous eukaryotic cell functions. One such paradigmatic mechanism
involves activation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) enzymes by G protein βγ subunits
from activated Gαi-Gβγ heterotrimers. Here, we report identification of a master 
switch to enable this control for PLCβ enzymes in living cells. We find that the 
Gαi-Gβγ-PLCβ-Ca2+ signaling module is entirely dependent on the presence of
active Gαq. If Gαq is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated, Gβγ can
bind to PLCβ but does not elicit Ca2+ signals. Removal of an auto-inhibitory
linker that occludes the active site of the enzyme is required and sufficient to 
empower "stand-alone control" of PLCβ by Gβγ. This dependence of Gi-Gβγ-Ca2+ on
Gαq places an entire signaling branch of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
under hierarchical control of Gq and changes our understanding of how Gi-GPCRs
trigger [Ca2+]i via PLCβ enzymes.

Reflecting its pleiotropic functions, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) localizes to
various sub-cellular structures during mitosis. At kinetochores, PLK1 contributes
to microtubule attachments and mitotic checkpoint signaling. Previous studies
identified a wealth of potential PLK1 receptors at kinetochores, as well as
requirements for various mitotic kinases, including BUB1, Aurora B, and PLK1
itself. Here, we combine ectopic localization, in vitro reconstitution, and
kinetochore localization studies to demonstrate that most and likely all of the
PLK1 is recruited through BUB1 in the outer kinetochore and centromeric protein U
(CENP-U) in the inner kinetochore. BUB1 and CENP-U share a constellation of
sequence motifs consisting of a putative PP2A-docking motif and two neighboring
PLK1-docking sites, which, contingent on priming phosphorylation by
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and PLK1 itself, bind PLK1 and promote its
dimerization. Our results rationalize previous observations and describe a
unifying mechanism for recruitment of PLK1 to human kinetochores.

Replication fork reversal is a global response to replication stress in mammalian
cells, but precisely how it occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that,
upon replication stress, DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) is recruited to
stalled forks in a manner dependent on the SNF2-family DNA translocases HLTF,
ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1. This is accompanied by an increase in TOP2A SUMOylation
mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase ZATT and followed by recruitment of a
SUMO-targeted DNA translocase, PICH. Disruption of the ZATT-TOP2A-PICH axis
results in accumulation of partially reversed forks and enhanced genome
instability. These results suggest that fork reversal occurs via a sequential
two-step process. First, HLTF, ZRANB3, and SMARCAL1 initiate limited fork
reversal, creating superhelical strain in the newly replicated sister chromatids.
Second, TOP2A drives extensive fork reversal by resolving the resulting
topological barriers and via its role in recruiting PICH to stalled forks.

Metazoan transcription factors typically regulate large numbers of genes. Here we
identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen ZNF410, a pentadactyl DNA-binding
protein that in human erythroid cells directly activates only a single gene, the 
NuRD component CHD4. Specificity is conveyed by two highly evolutionarily
conserved clusters of ZNF410 binding sites near the CHD4 gene with no
counterparts elsewhere in the genome. Loss of ZNF410 in adult-type human
erythroid cell culture systems and xenotransplantation settings diminishes CHD4
levels and derepresses the fetal hemoglobin genes. While previously known to be
silenced by CHD4, the fetal globin genes are exposed here as among the most
sensitive to reduced CHD4 levels.. In vitro DNA binding assays and
crystallographic studies reveal the ZNF410-DNA binding mode. ZNF410 is a
remarkably selective transcriptional activator in erythroid cells, and its
perturbation might offer new opportunities for treatment of hemoglobinopathies.

The mechanisms of cellular energy sensing and AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition are
not fully delineated. Here, we discover that RIPK1 promotes mTORC1 inhibition
during energetic stress. RIPK1 is involved in mediating the interaction between
AMPK and TSC2 and facilitate TSC2 phosphorylation at Ser1387. RIPK1 loss results 
in a high basal mTORC1 activity that drives defective lysosomes in cells and
mice, leading to accumulation of RIPK3 and CASP8 and sensitization to cell death.
RIPK1-deficient cells are unable to cope with energetic stress and are vulnerable
to low glucose levels and metformin. Inhibition of mTORC1 rescues the lysosomal
defects and vulnerability to energetic stress and prolongs the survival of
RIPK1-deficient neonatal mice. Thus, RIPK1 plays an important role in the
cellular response to low energy levels and mediates AMPK-mTORC1 signaling. These 
findings shed light on the regulation of mTORC1 during energetic stress and
unveil a point of crosstalk between pro-survival and pro-death pathways.

The PI3K pathway regulates cell metabolism, proliferation, and migration, and its
dysregulation is common in cancer. We now show that both physiologic and
oncogenic activation of PI3K signaling increase the expression of its negative
regulator PTEN. This limits the duration of the signal and output of the pathway.
Physiologic and pharmacologic inhibition of the pathway reduces PTEN and
contributes to the rebound in pathway activity in tumors treated with PI3K
inhibitors and limits their efficacy. Regulation of PTEN is due to
mTOR/4E-BP1-dependent control of its translation and is lost when 4E-BP1 is
deleted. Translational regulation of PTEN is therefore a major homeostatic
regulator of physiologic PI3K signaling and plays a role in reducing the pathway 
activation by oncogenic PIK3CA mutants and the antitumor activity of PI3K pathway
inhibitors. However, pathway output is hyperactivated in tumor cells with
coexistent PI3K mutation and loss of PTEN function.

Micronuclei are aberrant nuclear compartments that can form as a result of
chromosome mis-segregation. Frequent loss of micronuclear envelope integrity
exposes DNA to the cytoplasm, leading to chromosome fragmentation and immune
activation. Here, we use micronuclei purification to show that the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-associated nuclease TREX1 inhibits cGAS activation at micronuclei 
by degrading micronuclear DNA upon micronuclear envelope rupture. We demonstrate 
that the ER accesses ruptured micronuclei and plays a critical role in enabling
TREX1 nucleolytic attack. TREX1 mutations, previously implicated in immune
disease, untether TREX1 from the ER, disrupt TREX1 localization to micronuclei,
diminish micronuclear DNA damage, and enhance cGAS activation. These results
establish ER-directed resection of micronuclear DNA by TREX1 as a critical
regulator of cytosolic DNA sensing in chromosomally unstable cells and provide a 
mechanistic basis for the importance of TREX1 ER tethering in preventing
autoimmunity.

DNA replication forks use multiple mechanisms to deal with replication stress,
but how the choice of mechanisms is made is still poorly understood. Here, we
show that CARM1 associates with replication forks and reduces fork speed
independently of its methyltransferase activity. The speeding of replication
forks in CARM1-deficient cells requires RECQ1, which resolves reversed forks, and
RAD18, which promotes translesion synthesis. Loss of CARM1 reduces fork reversal 
and increases single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps but allows cells to tolerate
higher replication stress. Mechanistically, CARM1 interacts with PARP1 and
promotes PARylation at replication forks. In vitro, CARM1 stimulates PARP1
activity by enhancing its DNA binding and acts jointly with HPF1 to activate
PARP1. Thus, by stimulating PARP1, CARM1 slows replication forks and promotes the
use of fork reversal in the stress response, revealing that CARM1 and PARP1
function as a regulatory module at forks to control fork speed and the choice of 
stress response mechanisms.

The MYC oncoprotein globally affects the function of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). 
The ability of MYC to promote transcription elongation depends on its
ubiquitylation. Here, we show that MYC and PAF1c (polymerase II-associated factor
1 complex) interact directly and mutually enhance each other's association with
active promoters. PAF1c is rapidly transferred from MYC onto RNAPII. This
transfer is driven by the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase and is required for
MYC-dependent transcription elongation. MYC and HUWE1 promote histone H2B
ubiquitylation, which alters chromatin structure both for transcription
elongation and double-strand break repair. Consistently, MYC suppresses
double-strand break accumulation in active genes in a strictly PAF1c-dependent
manner. Depletion of PAF1c causes transcription-dependent accumulation of
double-strand breaks, despite widespread repair-associated DNA synthesis. Our
data show that the transfer of PAF1c from MYC onto RNAPII efficiently couples
transcription elongation with double-strand break repair to maintain the genomic 
integrity of MYC-driven tumor cells.

STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing in dendritic cells (DCs) initiates
antitumor immune responses, but how STING signaling is metabolically regulated in
the tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Here, we show that oxidative stress
is required for STING-induced DC antitumor function through a process that
directs SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3) activity. DC-specific deletion of Senp3 
drives tumor progression by blunting STING-dependent type-I interferon (IFN)
signaling in DCs and dampening antitumor immune responses. DC-derived reactive
oxygen species (ROS) trigger SENP3 accumulation and the SENP3-IFI204 interaction,
thereby catalyzing IFI204 deSUMOylation and boosting STING signaling activation
in mice. Consistently, SENP3 senses ROS to facilitate STING-dependent DC activity
in tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients. Our results reveal that
oxidative stress as a metabolic regulator promotes STING-mediated DC antitumor
immune responses and highlights SENP3 as an overflow valve for STING signaling
induction in the metabolically abnormal tumor microenvironment.

The RAD51 recombinase forms nucleoprotein filaments to promote double-strand
break repair, replication fork reversal, and fork stabilization. The stability of
these filaments is highly regulated, as both too little and too much RAD51
activity can cause genome instability. RADX is a single-strand DNA (ssDNA)
binding protein that regulates DNA replication. Here, we define its mechanism of 
action. We find that RADX inhibits RAD51 strand exchange and D-loop formation
activities. RADX directly and selectively interacts with ATP-bound RAD51,
stimulates ATP hydrolysis, and destabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments. The RADX
interaction with RAD51, in addition to its ssDNA binding capability, is required 
to maintain replication fork elongation rates and fork stability. Furthermore,
BRCA2 can overcome the RADX-dependent RAD51 inhibition. Thus, RADX functions in
opposition to BRCA2 in regulating RAD51 nucleofilament stability to ensure the
right level of RAD51 function during DNA replication.

Aberrant cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, including glioblastoma
(GBM). Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 6 activity
is required for the proliferation, stem-like properties, and tumorigenicity of
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation in GBM critical for malignancy.
We identified a casein kinase 2 (CK2)-PRMT6-regulator of chromatin condensation 1
(RCC1) signaling axis whose activity is an important contributor to the stem-like
properties and tumor biology of GSCs. CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes PRMT6
through deubiquitylation, which promotes PRMT6 methylation of RCC1, which in turn
is required for RCC1 association with chromatin and activation of RAN. Disruption
of this pathway results in defects in mitosis. EPZ020411, a specific
small-molecule inhibitor for PRMT6, suppresses RCC1 arginine methylation and
improves the cytotoxic activity of radiotherapy against GSC brain tumor
xenografts. This study identifies a CK2α-PRMT6-RCC1 signaling axis that can be
therapeutically targeted in the treatment of GBM.

The initiation of DNA replication involves cell cycle-dependent assembly and
disassembly of protein complexes, including the origin recognition complex (ORC) 
and CDC6 AAA+ ATPases. We report that multiple short linear protein motifs
(SLiMs) within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in ORC1 and CDC6 mediate
cyclin-CDK-dependent and independent protein-protein interactions, conditional on
the cell cycle phase. A domain within the ORC1 IDR is required for interaction
between the ORC1 and CDC6 AAA+ domains in G1, whereas the same domain prevents
CDC6-ORC1 interaction during mitosis. Then, during late G1, this domain
facilitates ORC1 destruction by a SKP2-cyclin A-CDK2-dependent mechanism. During 
G1, the CDC6 Cy motif cooperates with cyclin E-CDK2 to promote ORC1-CDC6
interactions. The CDC6 IDR regulates self-interaction by ORC1, thereby
controlling ORC1 protein levels. Protein phosphatase 1 binds directly to a SLiM
in the ORC1 IDR, causing ORC1 de-phosphorylation upon mitotic exit, increasing
ORC1 protein, and promoting pre-RC assembly.

Dysregulated mTORC1 signaling alters a wide range of cellular processes,
contributing to metabolic disorders and cancer. Defining the molecular details of
downstream effectors is thus critical for uncovering selective therapeutic
targets. We report that mTORC1 and its downstream kinase S6K enhance
eIF4A/4B-mediated translation of Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), an
adaptor for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase complex. This
regulation is mediated by 5' UTR of WTAP mRNA that is targeted by eIF4A/4B.
Single-nucleotide-resolution m6A mapping revealed that MAX dimerization protein 2
(MXD2) mRNA contains m6A, and increased m6A modification enhances its
degradation. WTAP induces cMyc-MAX association by suppressing MXD2 expression,
which promotes cMyc transcriptional activity and proliferation of
mTORC1-activated cancer cells. These results elucidate a mechanism whereby mTORC1
stimulates oncogenic signaling via m6A RNA modification and illuminates the
WTAP-MXD2-cMyc axis as a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven cancers.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates metabolism and
cell growth in response to nutrient, growth, and oncogenic signals. We found that
mTORC1 stimulates the synthesis of the major methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), through the control of methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A)
expression. The transcription factor c-MYC, downstream of mTORC1, directly binds 
to intron 1 of MAT2A and promotes its expression. Furthermore, mTORC1 increases
the protein abundance of Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), the positive 
regulatory subunit of the human N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase
complex. Through the control of MAT2A and WTAP levels, mTORC1 signaling
stimulates m6A RNA modification to promote protein synthesis and cell growth. A
decline in intracellular SAM levels upon MAT2A inhibition decreases m6A RNA
modification, protein synthesis rate, and tumor growth. Thus, mTORC1 adjusts m6A 
RNA modification through the control of SAM and WTAP levels to prime the
translation machinery for anabolic cell growth.

Glutaminase regulates glutaminolysis to promote cancer cell proliferation.
However, the mechanism underlying glutaminase activity regulation is largely
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kidney-type glutaminase (GLS) is highly
expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens with
correspondingly upregulated glutamine dependence for PDAC cell proliferation.
Upon oxidative stress, the succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase ADP-forming
subunit β (SUCLA2) phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
at S79 dissociates from GLS, resulting in enhanced GLS K311 succinylation,
oligomerization, and activity. Activated GLS increases glutaminolysis and the
production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and
glutathione, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and promoting tumor cell
survival and tumor growth in mice. In addition, the levels of SUCLA2 pS79 and GLS
K311 succinylation, which were mutually correlated, were positively associated
with advanced stages of PDAC and poor prognosis for patients. Our findings reveal
critical regulation of GLS by SUCLA2-coupled GLS succinylation regulation and
underscore the regulatory role of metabolites in glutaminolysis and PDAC
development.

Aberrant energy status contributes to multiple metabolic diseases, including
obesity, diabetes, and cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
Here, we report that ketogenic-diet-induced changes in energy status enhance the 
efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy by decreasing PD-L1 protein levels and
increasing expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and antigen presentation genes. 
Mechanistically, energy deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), which in turn, phosphorylates PD-L1 on Ser283, thereby disrupting its
interaction with CMTM4 and subsequently triggering PD-L1 degradation. In
addition, AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which disrupts PRC2 function, leading to
enhanced IFNs and antigen presentation gene expression. Through these mechanisms,
AMPK agonists or ketogenic diets enhance the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4
immunotherapy and improve the overall survival rate in syngeneic mouse tumor
models. Our findings reveal a pivotal role for AMPK in regulating the immune
response to immune-checkpoint blockade and advocate for combining ketogenic diets
or AMPK agonists with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy to combat cancer.

Meningioma-1 (MN1) overexpression in AML is associated with poor prognosis, and
forced expression of MN1 induces leukemia in mice. We sought to determine how MN1
causes AML. We found that overexpression of MN1 can be induced by translocations 
that result in hijacking of a downstream enhancer. Structure predictions revealed
that the entire MN1 coding frame is disordered. We identified the myeloid
progenitor-specific BAF complex as the key interaction partner of MN1. MN1
over-stabilizes BAF on enhancer chromatin, a function directly linked to the
presence of a long polyQ-stretch within MN1. BAF over-stabilization at binding
sites of transcription factors regulating a hematopoietic stem/progenitor program
prevents the developmentally appropriate decommissioning of these enhancers and
results in impaired myeloid differentiation and leukemia. Beyond AML, our data
detail how the overexpression of a polyQ protein, in the absence of any coding
sequence mutation, can be sufficient to cause malignant transformation.

Small RNA pathways defend the germlines of animals against selfish genetic
elements, yet pathway activities need to be contained to prevent silencing of
self genes. Here, we reveal a proteolytic mechanism that controls endogenous
small interfering (22G) RNA activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline to
protect genome integrity and maintain fertility. We find that DPF-3, a
P-granule-localized N-terminal dipeptidase orthologous to mammalian dipeptidyl
peptidase (DPP) 8/9, processes the unusually proline-rich N termini of WAGO-1 and
WAGO-3 Argonaute (Ago) proteins. Without DPF-3 activity, these WAGO proteins lose
their proper complement of 22G RNAs. Desilencing of repeat-containing and
transposon-derived transcripts, DNA damage, and acute sterility ensue. These
phenotypes are recapitulated when WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are rendered resistant to
DPF-3-mediated processing, identifying them as critical substrates of DPF-3. We
conclude that N-terminal processing of Ago proteins regulates their activity and 
promotes silencing of selfish genetic elements by ensuring Ago association with
appropriate small RNAs.

53BP1 influences genome stability via two independent mechanisms: (1) regulating 
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and (2) enhancing p53 activity. We
discovered a protein, Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that associates 
with the 53BP1 Tudor domain and prevents its recruitment to DSBs. Here, we
elucidate how TIRR affects 53BP1 function beyond its recruitment to DSBs and
biochemically links the two distinct roles of 53BP1. Loss of TIRR causes an
aberrant increase in the gene transactivation function of p53, affecting several 
p53-mediated cell-fate programs. TIRR inhibits the complex formation between the 
Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 (K382me2) that is poised for
transcriptional activation of its target genes. TIRR mRNA expression levels
negatively correlate with the expression of key p53 target genes in breast and
prostate cancers. Further, TIRR loss is selectively not tolerated in
p53-proficient tumors. Therefore, we establish that TIRR is an important
inhibitor of the 53BP1-p53 complex.

p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) regulates both the DNA damage response and p53
signaling. Although 53BP1's function is well established in DNA double-strand
break repair, how its role in p53 signaling is modulated remains poorly
understood. Here, we identify the scaffolding protein AHNAK as a G1
phase-enriched interactor of 53BP1. We demonstrate that AHNAK binds to the 53BP1 
oligomerization domain and controls its multimerization potential. Loss of AHNAK 
results in hyper-accumulation of 53BP1 on chromatin and enhanced phase
separation, culminating in an elevated p53 response, compromising cell survival
in cancer cells but leading to senescence in non-transformed cells. Cancer
transcriptome analyses indicate that AHNAK-53BP1 cooperation contributes to the
suppression of p53 target gene networks in tumors and that loss of AHNAK
sensitizes cells to combinatorial cancer treatments. These findings highlight
AHNAK as a rheostat of 53BP1 function, which surveys cell proliferation by
preventing an excessive p53 response.

The Shieldin complex shields double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic
resection. Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1, is one of the
least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors
THAP1, YY1, and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they
cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1, thereby ensuring a
proper balance between end protection and resection during DSB repair. The loss
of THAP1-dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross-resistance to poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and cisplatin in BRCA1-deficient cells and shorter
progression-free survival in ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, the embryonic
lethality and PARPi sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient mice is rescued by ablation of
SHLD1. Our study uncovers a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB
repair choice and suggests a potential link between DNA damage and pathogenic
THAP1 mutations, found in patients with the neurodevelopmental movement disorder 
adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6.

The assembly of nascent proteins into multi-subunit complexes is a tightly
regulated process that must occur at high fidelity to maintain cellular
homeostasis. The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) is an essential insertase that
requires seven membrane-spanning and two soluble cytosolic subunits to function. 
Here, we show that the kinase with no lysine 1 (WNK1), known for its role in
hypertension and neuropathy, functions as an assembly factor for the human EMC.
WNK1 uses a conserved amphipathic helix to stabilize the soluble subunit, EMC2,
by binding to the EMC2-8 interface. Shielding this hydrophobic surface prevents
promiscuous interactions of unassembled EMC2 and directly competes for binding of
E3 ubiquitin ligases, permitting assembly. Depletion of WNK1 thus destabilizes
both the EMC and its membrane protein clients. This work describes an unexpected 
role for WNK1 in protein biogenesis and defines the general requirements of an
assembly factor that will apply across the proteome.

The TSC complex is a critical negative regulator of the small GTPase Rheb and
mTORC1 in cellular stress signaling. The TSC2 subunit contains a catalytic GTPase
activating protein domain and interacts with multiple regulators, while the
precise function of TSC1 is unknown. Here we provide a structural
characterization of TSC1 and define three domains: a C-terminal coiled-coil that 
interacts with TSC2, a central helical domain that mediates TSC1 oligomerization,
and an N-terminal HEAT repeat domain that interacts with membrane
phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). TSC1 architecture, oligomerization, and
membrane binding are conserved in fungi and humans. We show that lysosomal
recruitment of the TSC complex and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1 upon
starvation depend on the marker lipid PI3,5P2, demonstrating a role for lysosomal
PIPs in regulating TSC complex and mTORC1 activity via TSC1. Our study thus
identifies a vital role of TSC1 in TSC complex function and mTORC1 signaling.

Lipid droplets are important for cancer cell growth and survival. However, the
mechanism underlying the initiation of lipid droplet lipolysis is not well
understood. We demonstrate here that glucose deprivation induces the binding of
choline kinase (CHK) α2 to lipid droplets, which is sequentially mediated by
AMPK-dependent CHKα2 S279 phosphorylation and KAT5-dependent CHKα2 K247
acetylation. Importantly, CHKα2 with altered catalytic domain conformation
functions as a protein kinase and phosphorylates PLIN2 at Y232 and PLIN3 at Y251.
The phosphorylated PLIN2/3 dissociate from lipid droplets and are degraded by
Hsc70-mediated autophagy, thereby promoting lipid droplet lipolysis, fatty acid
oxidation, and brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of CHKα2 S279
phosphorylation, CHKα2 K247 acetylation, and PLIN2/3 phosphorylation are
positively correlated with one another in human glioblastoma specimens and are
associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. These findings
underscore the role of CHKα2 as a protein kinase in lipolysis and glioblastoma
development.

Cholesterol metabolism is tightly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC).
Nevertheless, the clinical benefit of statins, the inhibitor of cholesterol
biogenesis mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is inconclusive, possibly because of a lack 
of patient stratification criteria. Here, we describe that YAP-mediated zinc
finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8) expression sensitizes intestinal tumors to
the inhibition of the MVA pathway. We show that the oncogenic activity of YAP
relies largely on ZMYND8 to enhance intracellular de novo cholesterol biogenesis.
Disruption of the ZMYND8-dependent MVA pathway greatly restricts the self-renewal
capacity of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and intestinal tumorigenesis.
Mechanistically, ZMYND8 and SREBP2 drive the enhancer-promoter interaction to
facilitate the recruitment of Mediator complex, thus upregulating MVA pathway
genes. Together, our results establish that the epigenetic reader ZMYND8 endows
YAP-high intestinal cancer with metabolic vulnerability.

DNA replication initiates at genomic locations known as origins of replication,
which, in S. cerevisiae, share a common DNA consensus motif. Despite being
virtually nucleosome-free, origins of replication are greatly influenced by the
surrounding chromatin state. Here, we show that histone H3 lysine 37
mono-methylation (H3K37me1) is catalyzed by Set1p and Set2p and that it regulates
replication origin licensing. H3K37me1 is uniformly distributed throughout most
of the genome, but it is scarce at replication origins, where it increases
according to the timing of their firing. We find that H3K37me1 hinders Mcm2
interaction with chromatin, maintaining low levels of MCM outside of conventional
replication origins. Lack of H3K37me1 results in defective DNA replication from
canonical origins while promoting replication events at inefficient and
non-canonical sites. Collectively, our results indicate that H3K37me1 ensures
correct execution of the DNA replication program by protecting the genome from
inappropriate origin licensing and spurious DNA replication.

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway
senses cytosolic DNA and induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to activate
the innate immune system. Here, we report the unexpected discovery that cGAS also
senses dysfunctional protein production. Purified ribosomes interact directly
with cGAS and stimulate its DNA-dependent activity in vitro. Disruption of the
ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway, which detects and
resolves ribosome collision during translation, results in cGAS-dependent ISG
expression and causes re-localization of cGAS from the nucleus to the cytosol.
Indeed, cGAS preferentially binds collided ribosomes in vitro, and orthogonal
perturbations that result in elevated levels of collided ribosomes and RQC
activation cause sub-cellular re-localization of cGAS and ribosome binding
in vivo as well. Thus, translation stress potently increases DNA-dependent cGAS
activation. These findings have implications for the inflammatory response to
viral infection and tumorigenesis, both of which substantially reprogram cellular
protein synthesis.

The transition of oxidized 5-methylcytosine (5mC) intermediates into the base
excision repair (BER) pipeline to complete DNA demethylation remains enigmatic.
We report here that UHRF2, the only paralog of UHRF1 in mammals that fails to
rescue Uhrf1-/- phenotype, is physically and functionally associated with BER
complex. We show that UHRF2 is allosterically activated by
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to catalyze
K33-linked polyubiquitination of XRCC1. This nonproteolytic action stimulates
XRCC1's interaction with the ubiquitin binding domain-bearing RAD23B, leading to 
the incorporation of TDG into BER complex. Integrative epigenomic analysis in
mouse embryonic stem cells reveals that Uhrf2-fostered TDG-RAD23B-BER complex is 
functionally linked to the completion of DNA demethylation at active promoters
and that Uhrf2 ablation impedes DNA demethylation on latent enhancers that
undergo poised-to-active transition during neuronal commitment. Together, these
observations highlight an essentiality of 5hmC-switched UHRF2 E3 ligase activity 
in commissioning the accomplishment of active DNA demethylation.

Stalled DNA replication fork restart after stress as orchestrated by ATR kinase, 
BLM helicase, and structure-specific nucleases enables replication, cell
survival, and genome stability. Here we unveil human exonuclease V (EXO5) as an
ATR-regulated DNA structure-specific nuclease and BLM partner for replication
fork restart. We find that elevated EXO5 in tumors correlates with increased
mutation loads and poor patient survival, suggesting that EXO5 upregulation has
oncogenic potential. Structural, mechanistic, and mutational analyses of EXO5 and
EXO5-DNA complexes reveal a single-stranded DNA binding channel with an adjacent 
ATR phosphorylation motif (T88Q89) that regulates EXO5 nuclease activity and BLM 
binding identified by mass spectrometric analysis. EXO5 phospho-mimetic mutant
rescues the restart defect from EXO5 depletion that decreases fork progression,
DNA damage repair, and cell survival. EXO5 depletion furthermore rescues survival
of FANCA-deficient cells and indicates EXO5 functions epistatically with SMARCAL1
and BLM. Thus, an EXO5 axis connects ATR and BLM in directing replication fork
restart.

RAD51 facilitates replication fork reversal and protects reversed forks from
nuclease degradation. Although potentially a useful replication stress response
mechanism, unregulated fork reversal can cause genome instability. Here we show
that RADX, a single-strand DNA binding protein that binds to and destabilizes
RAD51 nucleofilaments, can either inhibit or promote fork reversal depending on
replication stress levels. RADX inhibits fork reversal at elongating forks,
thereby preventing fork slowing and collapse. Paradoxically, in the presence of
persistent replication stress, RADX localizes to stalled forks to generate
reversed fork structures. Consequently, inactivating RADX prevents
fork-reversal-dependent telomere dysfunction in the absence of RTEL1 and blocks
nascent strand degradation when fork protection factors are inactivated. Addition
of RADX increases SMARCAL1-dependent fork reversal in conditions in which
pre-binding RAD51 to a model fork substrate is inhibitory. Thus, RADX directly
interacts with RAD51 and single-strand DNA to confine fork reversal to
persistently stalled forks.

Accurate control of innate immune responses is required to eliminate invading
pathogens and simultaneously avoid autoinflammation and autoimmune diseases.
Here, we demonstrate that arginine monomethylation precisely regulates the
mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral response.
Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) forms aggregates to catalyze MAVS
monomethylation at arginine residue 52 (R52), attenuating its binding to TRIM31
and RIG-I, which leads to the suppression of MAVS aggregation and subsequent
activation. Upon virus infection, aggregated PRMT7 is disabled in a timely manner
due to automethylation at arginine residue 32 (R32), and SMURF1 is recruited to
PRMT7 by MAVS to induce proteasomal degradation of PRMT7, resulting in the relief
of PRMT7 suppression of MAVS activation. Therefore, we not only reveal that
arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 negatively regulates MAVS-mediated antiviral
signaling in vitro and in vivo but also uncover a mechanism by which PRMT7 is
tightly controlled to ensure the timely activation of antiviral defense.

OTULIN coordinates with LUBAC to edit linear polyubiquitin chains in embryonic
development, autoimmunity, and inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by
which angiogenesis, especially that of endothelial cells (ECs), is regulated by
linear ubiquitination remains unclear. Here, we reveal that constitutive or
EC-specific deletion of Otulin resulted in arteriovenous malformations and
embryonic lethality. LUBAC conjugates linear ubiquitin chains onto Activin
receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), which is responsible for angiogenesis defects,
inhibiting ALK1 enzyme activity and Smad1/5 activation. Conversely, OTULIN
deubiquitinates ALK1 to promote Smad1/5 activation. Consistently, embryonic
survival of Otulin-deficient mice was prolonged by BMP9 pretreatment or
EC-specific ALK1Q200D (constitutively active) knockin. Moreover, mutant ALK1 from
type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT2) patients exhibited excessive 
linear ubiquitination and increased HOIP binding. As such, a HOIP inhibitor
restricted the excessive angiogenesis of ECs derived from ALK1G309S-expressing
HHT2 patients. These results show that OTULIN and LUBAC govern ALK1 activity to
balance EC angiogenesis.

Cells communicate with their environment via surface proteins and secreted
factors. Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) is an evolutionarily conserved
process, via which distinct cargo proteins are secreted upon stress. Most UPS
types depend upon the Golgi-associated GRASP55 protein. However, its regulation
and biological role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic 
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) directly phosphorylates GRASP55 to
maintain its Golgi localization, thus revealing a physiological role for mTORC1
at this organelle. Stimuli that inhibit mTORC1 cause GRASP55 dephosphorylation
and relocalization to UPS compartments. Through multiple, unbiased, proteomic
analyses, we identify numerous cargoes that follow this unconventional secretory 
route to reshape the cellular secretome and surfactome. Using MMP2 secretion as a
proxy for UPS, we provide important insights on its regulation and physiological 
role. Collectively, our findings reveal the mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling hub as the
integration point in stress signaling upstream of UPS and as a key coordinator of
the cellular adaptation to stress.

The transformed state in acute leukemia requires gene regulatory programs
involving transcription factors and chromatin modulators. Here, we uncover an
IRF8-MEF2D transcriptional circuit as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-biased
dependency. We discover and characterize the mechanism by which the chromatin
"reader" ZMYND8 directly activates IRF8 in parallel with the MYC proto-oncogene
through their lineage-specific enhancers. ZMYND8 is essential for AML
proliferation in vitro and in vivo and associates with MYC and IRF8 enhancer
elements that we define in cell lines and in patient samples. ZMYND8 occupancy at
IRF8 and MYC enhancers requires BRD4, a transcription coactivator also necessary 
for AML proliferation. We show that ZMYND8 binds to the ET domain of BRD4 via its
chromatin reader cassette, which in turn is required for proper chromatin
occupancy and maintenance of leukemic growth in vivo. Our results rationalize
ZMYND8 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating essential transcriptional
programs in AML.

Mitochondrial dynamics regulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission maintain
mitochondrial functions, whose alterations underline various human diseases.
Here, we show that inositol is a critical metabolite directly restricting
AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission independently of its classical mode as a
precursor for phosphoinositide generation. Inositol decline by IMPA1/2 deficiency
elicits AMPK activation and mitochondrial fission without affecting ATP level,
whereas inositol accumulation prevents AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission.
Metabolic stress or mitochondrial damage causes inositol decline in cells and
mice to elicit AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission. Inositol directly binds to
AMPKγ and competes with AMP for AMPKγ binding, leading to restriction of AMPK
activation and mitochondrial fission. Our study suggests that the AMP/inositol
ratio is a critical determinant for AMPK activation and establishes a model in
which AMPK activation requires inositol decline to release AMPKγ for AMP binding.
Hence, AMPK is an inositol sensor, whose inactivation by inositol serves as a
mechanism to restrict mitochondrial fission.

A metabolic imbalance between lipid synthesis and degradation can lead to hepatic
lipid accumulation, a characteristic of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). Here, we report that high-fat-diet-induced sterol regulatory
element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a key transcription factor that regulates
lipid biosynthesis, impairs autophagic lipid catabolism via altered H2S
signaling. SREBP-1c reduced cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) via miR-216a, which
in turn decreased hepatic H2S levels and sulfhydration-dependent activation of
Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1). Furthermore, Cys951Ser mutation
of ULK1 decreased autolysosome formation and promoted hepatic lipid accumulation 
in mice, suggesting that the loss of ULK1 sulfhydration was directly associated
with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Moreover, silencing of CSE in SREBP-1c knockout
mice increased liver triglycerides, confirming the connection between CSE,
autophagy, and SREBP-1c. Overall, our results uncover a 2-fold mechanism for
SREBP-1c-driven hepatic lipid accumulation through reciprocal activation and
inhibition of hepatic lipid biosynthesis and degradation, respectively.

Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 play a pathogenic role in cancers, 
including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by producing oncometabolite
2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation
activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) 
R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in
human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate
(α-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of
mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation 
events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit
upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1
and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine
phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2
is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes
leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for 
transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.

Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 play a pathogenic role in cancers, 
including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by producing oncometabolite
2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation
activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) 
R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in
human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate
(α-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of
mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation 
events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit
upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1
and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine
phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2
is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes
leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for 
transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.

Deregulation of oncogenic signals in cancer triggers replication stress.
Immediate early genes (IEGs) are rapidly and transiently expressed following
stressful signals, contributing to an integrated response. Here, we find that the
orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 localizes across the gene body and 3' UTR of IEGs, 
where it inhibits transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II, generating R-loops
and accessible chromatin domains. Acute replication stress causes immediate
dissociation of NR4A1 and a burst of transcriptionally poised IEG expression.
Ectopic expression of NR4A1 enhances tumorigenesis by breast cancer cells, while 
its deletion leads to massive chromosomal instability and proliferative failure, 
driven by deregulated expression of its IEG target, FOS. Approximately half of
breast and other primary cancers exhibit accessible chromatin domains at IEG gene
bodies, consistent with this stress-regulatory pathway. Cancers that have
retained this mechanism in adapting to oncogenic replication stress may be
dependent on NR4A1 for their proliferation.

Missense mutations of the tumor suppressor Neurofibromin 2
(NF2/Merlin/schwannomin) result in sporadic to frequent occurrences of
tumorigenesis in multiple organs. However, the underlying pathogenicity of
NF2-related tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. Here we found that NF2
facilitated innate immunity by regulating YAP/TAZ-mediated TBK1 inhibition.
Unexpectedly, patient-derived individual mutations in the FERM domain of NF2
(NF2m) converted NF2 into a potent suppressor of cGAS-STING signaling.
Mechanistically, NF2m gained extreme associations with IRF3 and TBK1 and, upon
innate nucleic acid sensing, was directly induced by the activated IRF3 to form
cellular condensates, which contained the PP2A complex, to eliminate TBK1
activation. Accordingly, NF2m robustly suppressed STING-initiated antitumor
immunity in cancer cell-autonomous and -nonautonomous murine models, and
NF2m-IRF3 condensates were evident in human vestibular schwannomas. Our study
reports phase separation-mediated quiescence of cGAS-STING signaling by a mutant 
tumor suppressor and reveals gain-of-function pathogenesis for NF2-related tumors
by regulating antitumor immunity.

SNAI2/SLUG, a metastasis-promoting transcription factor, is a labile protein that
is degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome degradation system. Here, we
conducted comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function screens using a human DUB cDNA
library of 65 genes and an siRNA library of 98 genes, and identified USP20 as a
deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates SNAI2 ubiquitination and stability. Further
investigation of USP20 demonstrated its function in promoting migration,
invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. USP20 positively correlates with SNAI2
protein level in breast tumor samples, and higher USP20 expression is associated 
with poor prognosis in ER- breast cancer patients.

    Genes Dev. 2020 Oct 1;34(19-20):1253-1255.

The uptake of macromolecules and cellular debris through macropinocytosis has
emerged as an important nutrient acquisition strategy of cancer cells. Genetic
alterations commonly found in human cancers (e.g. mutations in KRAS or loss of
PTEN) have been shown to increase macropinocytosis. To identify additional
effectors that enable cell growth dependent on the uptake of extracellular
proteins, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells were selected for growth
in medium where extracellular albumin was the obligate source of the essential
amino acid leucine. Analysis of global changes in chromatin availability and gene
expression revealed that PDA cells selected under these conditions exhibited
elevated activity of the transcriptional activators Yap/Taz. Knockout of Yap/Taz 
prevented growth of PDA cells in leucine-deficient medium, but not in complete
medium. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of Yap or Taz were sufficient to
stimulate macropinocytosis of extracellular protein. In addition to promoting the
uptake of plasma proteins, Yap/Taz also promoted the scavenging of apoptotic cell
bodies and necrotic debris by PDA cells. The Yap/Taz transcriptional target Axl
was found to be essential for cell growth dependent on the uptake of dead cells
and cell debris. Together, these studies suggest that the Hippo pathway effectors
Yap and Taz are important transcriptional regulators of endocytic nutrient
uptake.

CDK7 associates with the 10-subunit TFIIH complex and regulates transcription by 
phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Few
additional CDK7 substrates are known. Here, using the covalent inhibitor SY-351
and quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified CDK7 kinase substrates in human
cells. Among hundreds of high-confidence targets, the vast majority are unique to
CDK7 (i.e., distinct from other transcription-associated kinases), with a subset 
that suggest novel cellular functions. Transcription-associated factors were
predominant CDK7 substrates, including SF3B1, U2AF2, and other splicing
components. Accordingly, widespread and diverse splicing defects, such as
alternative exon inclusion and intron retention, were characterized in
CDK7-inhibited cells. Combined with biochemical assays, we establish that CDK7
directly activates other transcription-associated kinases CDK9, CDK12, and CDK13,
invoking a "master regulator" role in transcription. We further demonstrate that 
TFIIH restricts CDK7 kinase function to the RNAPII CTD, whereas other substrates 
(e.g., SPT5 and SF3B1) are phosphorylated by the three-subunit CDK-activating
kinase (CAK; CCNH, MAT1, and CDK7). These results suggest new models for CDK7
function in transcription and implicate CAK dissociation from TFIIH as essential 
for kinase activation. This straightforward regulatory strategy ensures CDK7
activation is spatially and temporally linked to transcription, and may apply
toward other transcription-associated kinases.

Macrophages polarize into functionally distinct subtypes while responding to
microenvironmental cues. The identity of proximal transcription factors (TFs)
downstream from the polarization signals are known, but their activity is
typically transient, failing to explain the long-term, stable epigenomic programs
developed. Here, we mapped the early and late epigenomic changes of interleukin-4
(IL-4)-induced alternative macrophage polarization. We identified the TF, early
growth response 2 (EGR2), bridging the early transient and late stable gene
expression program of polarization. EGR2 is a direct target of IL-4-activated
STAT6, having broad action indispensable for 77% of the induced gene signature of
alternative polarization, including its autoregulation and a robust, downstream
TF cascade involving PPARG. Mechanistically, EGR2 binding results in chromatin
opening and the recruitment of chromatin remodelers and RNA polymerase II. Egr2
induction is evolutionarily conserved during alternative polarization of mouse
and human macrophages. In the context of tissue resident macrophages, Egr2
expression is most prominent in the lung of a variety of species. Thus, EGR2 is
an example of an essential and evolutionarily conserved broad acting factor,
linking transient polarization signals to stable epigenomic and transcriptional
changes in macrophages.

Catalytic-inactivating mutations within the Drosophila enhancer H3K4
mono-methyltransferase Trr and its mammalian homologs, MLL3/4, cause only minor
changes in gene expression compared with whole-gene deletions for these COMPASS
members. To identify essential histone methyltransferase-independent functions of
Trr, we screened to identify a minimal Trr domain sufficient to rescue Trr-null
lethality and demonstrate that this domain binds and stabilizes Utx in vivo.
Using the homologous MLL3/MLL4 human sequences, we mapped a short ∼80-amino-acid 
UTX stabilization domain (USD) that promotes UTX stability in the absence of the 
rest of MLL3/4. Nuclear UTX stability is enhanced when the USD is fused with the 
MLL4 HMG-box. Thus, COMPASS-dependent UTX stabilization is an essential
noncatalytic function of Trr/MLL3/MLL4, suggesting that stabilizing UTX could be 
a therapeutic strategy for cancers with MLL3/4 loss-of-function mutations.

p53 is an intensely studied tumor-suppressive transcription factor. Recent
studies suggest that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) ZMAT3 is important in
mediating the tumor-suppressive effects of p53. Here, we globally identify
ZMAT3-regulated RNAs and their binding sites at nucleotide resolution in intact
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. ZMAT3 binds to thousands of mRNA precursors,
mainly at intronic uridine-rich sequences and affects their splicing. The
strongest alternatively spliced ZMAT3 target was CD44, a cell adhesion gene and
stem cell marker that controls tumorigenesis. Silencing ZMAT3 increased inclusion
of CD44 variant exons, resulting in significant up-regulation of oncogenic CD44
isoforms (CD44v) and increased CRC cell growth that was rescued by concurrent
knockdown of CD44v Silencing p53 phenocopied the loss of ZMAT3 with respect to
CD44 alternative splicing, suggesting that ZMAT3-mediated regulation of CD44
splicing is vital for p53 function. Collectively, our findings uncover a
p53-ZMAT3-CD44 axis in growth suppression in CRC cells.

The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is activated by metabolic
stress and promotes the development of metabolic syndrome, including
hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. This integrated
physiological response involves cross-talk between different organs. Here we
demonstrate that JNK signaling in adipocytes causes an increased circulating
concentration of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) that
regulates systemic metabolism. The mechanism of organ crosstalk is mediated by a 
feed-forward regulatory loop caused by JNK-regulated FGF21 autocrine signaling in
adipocytes that promotes increased expression of the adipokine adiponectin and
subsequent hepatic expression of the hormone FGF21. The mechanism of organ
cross-talk places circulating adiponectin downstream of autocrine FGF21 expressed
by adipocytes and upstream of endocrine FGF21 expressed by hepatocytes. This
regulatory loop represents a novel signaling paradigm that connects autocrine and
endocrine signaling modes of the same hormone in different tissues.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease characterized by late
diagnosis, propensity for early metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Little
is known about the mechanisms that drive innate therapeutic resistance in
pancreatic cancer. The ataxia-telangiectasia group D-associated gene (ATDC) is
overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Our 
study reveals that increased ATDC levels protect cancer cells from reactive
oxygen species (ROS) via stabilization of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (NRF2). Mechanistically, ATDC binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
1 (KEAP1), the principal regulator of NRF2 degradation, and thereby prevents
degradation of NRF2 resulting in activation of a NRF2-dependent transcriptional
program, reduced intracellular ROS and enhanced chemoresistance. Our findings
define a novel role of ATDC in regulating redox balance and chemotherapeutic
resistance by modulating NRF2 activity.

Senescence is a key barrier to neoplastic transformation. To identify senescence 
regulators relevant to cancer, we screened a genome-wide shRNA library. Here, we 
describe exportin 7 (XPO7) as a novel regulator of senescence and validate its
function in telomere-induced, replicative, and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS).
XPO7 is a bidirectional transporter that regulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic
shuttling of a broad range of substrates. Depletion of XPO7 results in reduced
levels of TCF3 and an impaired induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21CIP1 during OIS. Deletion of XPO7 correlates with poorer overall survival in
several cancer types. Moreover, depletion of XPO7 alleviated OIS and increased
tumor formation in a mouse model of liver cancer. Our results suggest that XPO7
is a novel tumor suppressor that regulates p21CIP1 expression to control
senescence and tumorigenesis.

Myocardin, a potent coactivator of serum response factor (SRF), competes with
ternary complex factor (TCF) proteins for SRF binding to balance opposing
mitogenic and myogenic gene programs in cardiac and smooth muscle. Here we
identify a cardiac lncRNA transcribed adjacent to myocardin, named CARDINAL,
which antagonizes SRF-dependent mitogenic gene transcription in the heart.
CARDINAL-deficient mice show ectopic TCF/SRF-dependent mitogenic gene expression 
and decreased cardiac contractility in response to age and ischemic stress.
CARDINAL forms a nuclear complex with SRF and inhibits TCF-mediated
transactivation of the promitogenic gene c-fos, suggesting CARDINAL functions as 
an RNA cofactor for SRF in the heart.

Kinesin-1 carries cargos including proteins, RNAs, vesicles, and pathogens over
long distances within cells. The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well
described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood.
Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is
mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a
putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins
cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution
crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled
coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel
orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding
site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction 
for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA
directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which
forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its
adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a
stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1
from classical motor adaptors.

Lung adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent lung cancer subtype, is characterized by 
its high propensity to metastasize. Despite the importance of metastasis in lung 
cancer mortality, its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely
elusive. Here, we identified miR-200 miRNAs as potent suppressors for lung
adenocarcinoma metastasis. miR-200 expression is specifically repressed in mouse 
metastatic lung adenocarcinomas, and miR-200 decrease strongly correlates with
poor patient survival. Consistently, deletion of mir-200c/141 in the Kras
LSL-G12D/+ ; Trp53 flox/flox lung adenocarcinoma mouse model significantly
promoted metastasis, generating a desmoplastic tumor stroma highly reminiscent of
metastatic human lung cancer. miR-200 deficiency in lung cancer cells promotes
the proliferation and activation of adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), which in turn elevates the metastatic potential of cancer cells. miR-200 
regulates the functional interaction between cancer cells and CAFs, at least in
part, by targeting Notch ligand Jagged1 and Jagged2 in cancer cells and inducing 
Notch activation in adjacent CAFs. Hence, the interaction between cancer cells
and CAFs constitutes an essential mechanism to promote metastatic potential.

In all organisms with circadian clocks, post-translational modifications of clock
proteins control the dynamics of circadian rhythms, with phosphorylation playing 
a dominant role. All major clock proteins are highly phosphorylated, and many
kinases have been described to be responsible. In contrast, it is largely unclear
whether and to what extent their counterparts, the phosphatases, play an equally 
crucial role. To investigate this, we performed a systematic RNAi screen in human
cells and identified protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) with its regulatory subunit
PPP4R2 as critical components of the circadian system in both mammals and
Drosophila Genetic depletion of PPP4 shortens the circadian period, whereas
overexpression lengthens it. PPP4 inhibits CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation activity
by binding to BMAL1 and counteracting its phosphorylation. This leads to
increased CLOCK/BMAL1 DNA occupancy and decreased transcriptional activity, which
counteracts the "kamikaze" properties of CLOCK/BMAL1. Through this mechanism,
PPP4 contributes to the critical delay of negative feedback by retarding
PER/CRY/CK1δ-mediated inhibition of CLOCK/BMAL1.

The establishment of cell fates involves alterations of transcription factor
repertoires and repurposing of transcription factors by post-translational
modifications. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the chromatin organizers SATB2 and
SATB1 balance pluripotency and differentiation by activating and repressing
pluripotency genes, respectively. Here, we show that conditional Satb2 gene
inactivation weakens ESC pluripotency, and we identify SUMO2 modification of
SATB2 by the E3 ligase ZFP451 as a potential driver of ESC differentiation.
Mutations of two SUMO-acceptor lysines of Satb2 (Satb2 K → R ) or knockout of
Zfp451 impair the ability of ESCs to silence pluripotency genes and activate
differentiation-associated genes in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment.
Notably, the forced expression of a SUMO2-SATB2 fusion protein in either Satb2 K 
→ R or Zfp451 -/- ESCs rescues, in part, their impaired differentiation potential
and enhances the down-regulation of Nanog The differentiation defect of Satb2 K →
R ESCs correlates with altered higher-order chromatin interactions relative to
Satb2 wt ESCs. Upon RA treatment of Satb2 wt ESCs, SATB2 interacts with ZFP451
and the LSD1/CoREST complex and gains binding at differentiation genes, which is 
not observed in RA-treated Satb2 K → R cells. Thus, SATB2 SUMOylation may
contribute to the rewiring of transcriptional networks and the chromatin
interactome of ESCs in the transition of pluripotency to differentiation.

Accurate chromosome segregation demands efficient capture of microtubules by
kinetochores and their conversion to stable bioriented attachments that can
congress and then segregate chromosomes. An early event is the shedding of the
outermost fibrous corona layer of the kinetochore following microtubule
attachment. Centromere protein F (CENP-F) is part of the corona, contains two
microtubule-binding domains, and physically associates with dynein motor
regulators. Here, we have combined CRISPR gene editing and engineered
separation-of-function mutants to define how CENP-F contributes to kinetochore
function. We show that the two microtubule-binding domains make distinct
contributions to attachment stability and force transduction but are dispensable 
for chromosome congression. We further identify a specialized domain that
functions to limit the dynein-mediated stripping of corona cargoes through a
direct interaction with Nde1. This antagonistic activity is crucial for
maintaining the required corona composition and ensuring efficient kinetochore
biorientation.

Centrosome disjunction occurs in late G2 to facilitate bipolar spindle formation 
and is mediated by the NIMA-related kinase Nek2. Here, we show that GAS2L1, a
microtubule- and F-actin-binding protein required for centrosome disjunction,
undergoes Nek2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser352 in G2/M. The phosphorylation is
essential for centrosome disjunction in late G2 and for proper spindle assembly
and faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis. GAS2L1 contains a
calponin-homology (CH) domain and a GAS2-related (GAR) domain, which bind to
F-actin and microtubules, respectively. Notably, the CH and GAR domains bind to
each other to inhibit the functions of both domains, and Ser352 phosphorylation
disrupts the interaction between the two domains and relieves the autoinhibition.
We dissected the roles of the GAS2L1 phosphorylation and of centrosome-linker
disassembly, which is another Nek2-mediated event, and found that these events
together trigger centrosome disjunction. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the 
concerted Nek2 actions that split the centrosomes in late G2.

that, of these components, only Sfh4 and Stt4 regulate Psd2 activity in vivo.
They do so via distinct mechanisms. Sfh4 operates via a mechanism for which its
PtdIns-transfer activity is dispensable but requires an Sfh4-Psd2 physical
interaction. The other requires Stt4-mediated production of PtdIns-4-phosphate
(PtdIns4P), where Stt4 (along with the Sac1 PtdIns4P phosphatase and endoplasmic 
reticulum-plasma membrane tethers) indirectly modulate Psd2 activity via a
PtdIns4P homeostatic mechanism that influences PtdSer accessibility to Psd2.
These results identify an example in which the biological function of a
Sec14-like PITP is cleanly uncoupled from its canonical in vitro PtdIns-transfer 
activity and challenge popular functional assumptions regarding lipid-transfer
protein involvements in MCS function.

In addition to the classical pathway of secretion, some transmembrane proteins
reach the plasma membrane through alternative routes. Several proteins transit
through endosomes and are exported in a Rab8-, Rab10-, and/or Rab11-dependent
manner. GRAFs are membrane-binding proteins associated with tubules and vesicles.
We found extensive colocalization of GRAF1b/2 with Rab8a/b and partial with
Rab10. We identified MICAL1 and WDR44 as direct GRAF-binding partners. MICAL1
links GRAF1b/2 to Rab8a/b and Rab10, and WDR44 binds Rab11. Endogenous WDR44
labels a subset of tubular endosomes, which are closely aligned with the ER via
binding to VAPA/B. With its BAR domain, GRAF2 can tubulate membranes, and in its 
absence WDR44 tubules are not observed. We show that GRAF2 and WDR44 are
essential for the export of neosynthesized E-cadherin, MMP14, and CFTR ΔF508,
three proteins whose exocytosis is sensitive to ER stress. Overexpression of
dominant negative mutants of GRAF1/2, WDR44, and MICAL1 also interferes with it, 
facilitating future studies of Rab8/10/11-dependent exocytic pathways of central 
importance in biology.

How the cell rapidly and completely reorganizes its architecture when it divides 
is a problem that has fascinated researchers for almost 150 yr. We now know that 
the core regulatory machinery is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but how these
multiple protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases are
coordinated in space and time to remodel the cell in a matter of minutes remains 
a major question. Cyclin B1-Cdk is the primary kinase that drives mitotic
remodeling; here we show that it is targeted to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by
binding an acidic face of the kinetochore checkpoint protein, MAD1, where it
coordinates NPC disassembly with kinetochore assembly. Localized cyclin B1-Cdk1
is needed for the proper release of MAD1 from the embrace of TPR at the nuclear
pore so that it can be recruited to kinetochores before nuclear envelope
breakdown to maintain genomic stability.

Microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase-like (MASTL) is a
mitosis-accelerating kinase with emerging roles in cancer progression. However,
possible cell cycle-independent mechanisms behind its oncogenicity remain
ambiguous. Here, we identify MASTL as an activator of cell contractility and
MRTF-A/SRF (myocardin-related transcription factor A/serum response factor)
signaling. Depletion of MASTL increased cell spreading while reducing contractile
actin stress fibers in normal and breast cancer cells and strongly impairing
breast cancer cell motility and invasion. Transcriptome and proteome profiling
revealed MASTL-regulated genes implicated in cell movement and actomyosin
contraction, including Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1, ARHGEF2)
and MRTF-A target genes tropomyosin 4.2 (TPM4), vinculin (VCL), and nonmuscle
myosin IIB (NM-2B, MYH10). Mechanistically, MASTL associated with MRTF-A and
increased its nuclear retention and transcriptional activity. Importantly, MASTL 
kinase activity was not required for regulation of cell spreading or MRTF-A/SRF
transcriptional activity. Taken together, we present a previously unknown
kinase-independent role for MASTL as a regulator of cell adhesion, contractility,
and MRTF-A/SRF activity.

elegans embryo development.

The evolutionarily conserved microtubule (MT)-severing AAA-ATPase enzyme Katanin 
is emerging as a critical regulator of MT dynamics. In Caenorhabditis elegans,
Katanin MT-severing activity is essential for meiotic spindle assembly but is
toxic for the mitotic spindle. Here we analyzed Katanin dynamics in C. elegans
and deciphered the role of Katanin phosphorylation in the regulation of its
activity and stability. Katanin is abundant in oocytes, and its levels drop after
meiosis, but unexpectedly, a significant fraction is present throughout
embryogenesis, where it is dynamically recruited to the centrosomes and
chromosomes during mitosis. We show that the minibrain kinase MBK-2, which is
activated during meiosis, phosphorylates Katanin at multiple serines. We
demonstrate unequivocally that Katanin phosphorylation at a single residue is
necessary and sufficient to target Katanin for proteasomal degradation after
meiosis, whereas phosphorylation at the other sites only inhibits Katanin ATPase 
activity stimulated by MTs. Our findings suggest that cycles of phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation fine-tune Katanin level and activity to deliver the
appropriate MT-severing activity during development.

The TGN is a key compartment for the sorting and secretion of newly synthesized
proteins. At the TGN, soluble proteins are sorted based on the instructions
carried in their oligosaccharide backbones or by a Ca2+-mediated process that
involves the cargo-sorting protein Cab45. Here, we show that Cab45 is
phosphorylated by the Golgi-specific protein kinase Fam20C. Mimicking of
phosphorylation translocates Cab45 into TGN-derived vesicles, which goes along
with an increased export of LyzC, a Cab45 client. Our findings demonstrate that
Fam20C plays a key role in the export of Cab45 clients by fine-tuning Cab45
oligomerization and thus impacts Cab45 retention in the TGN.

Blockade antibodies of the immunoinhibitory receptor PD-1 can stimulate the
anti-tumor activity of T cells, but clinical benefit is limited to a fraction of 
patients. Evidence suggests that BTLA, a receptor structurally related to PD-1,
may contribute to resistance to PD-1 targeted therapy, but how BTLA and PD-1
differ in their mechanisms is debated. Here, we compared the abilities of BTLA
and PD-1 to recruit effector molecules and to regulate T cell signaling. While
PD-1 selectively recruited SHP2 over the stronger phosphatase SHP1, BTLA
preferentially recruited SHP1 to more efficiently suppress T cell signaling.
Contrary to the dominant view that PD-1 and BTLA signal exclusively through
SHP1/2, we found that in SHP1/2 double-deficient primary T cells, PD-1 and BTLA
still potently inhibited cell proliferation and cytokine production, albeit more 
transiently than in wild type T cells. Thus, PD-1 and BTLA can suppress T cell
signaling through a mechanism independent of both SHP1 and SHP2.

Mechanisms coupling the atypical PKC (aPKC) kinase activity to its subcellular
localization are essential for cell polarization. Unlike other members of the PKC
family, aPKC has no well-defined plasma membrane (PM) or calcium binding domains,
leading to the assumption that its subcellular localization relies exclusively on
protein-protein interactions. Here we show that in both Drosophila and mammalian 
cells, the pseudosubstrate region (PSr) of aPKC acts as a polybasic domain
capable of targeting aPKC to the PM via electrostatic binding to PM PI4P and
PI(4,5)P2. However, physical interaction between aPKC and Par-6 is required for
the PM-targeting of aPKC, likely by allosterically exposing the PSr to bind PM.
Binding of Par-6 also inhibits aPKC kinase activity, and such inhibition can be
relieved through Par-6 interaction with apical polarity protein Crumbs. Our data 
suggest a potential mechanism in which allosteric regulation of polybasic PSr by 
Par-6 couples the control of both aPKC subcellular localization and spatial
activation of its kinase activity.

Protein kinases direct polarized growth by regulating the cytoskeleton in time
and space and could play similar roles in cell division. We found that the
Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile 
actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation.
Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with
cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 
substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we
found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to
the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its 
association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 
signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes
can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines
a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR
assembly in the correct time and place.

Rsp5, the Nedd4 family member in yeast, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
numerous cellular processes, many of which require Rsp5 to interact with PY-motif
containing adaptor proteins. Here, we show that two paralogous transmembrane Rsp5
adaptors, Rcr1 and Rcr2, are sorted to distinct cellular locations: Rcr1 is a
plasma membrane (PM) protein, whereas Rcr2 is sorted to the vacuole. Rcr2 is
delivered to the vacuole using ubiquitin as a sorting signal. Rcr1 is delivered
to the PM by the exomer complex using a newly uncovered PM sorting motif.
Further, we show that Rcr1, but not Rcr2, is up-regulated via the
calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway. Upon exogenous calcium treatment, Rcr1
ubiquitinates and down-regulates the chitin synthase Chs3. We propose that the
PM-anchored Rsp5/Rcr1 ubiquitin ligase-adaptor complex can provide an acute
response to degrade unwanted proteins under stress conditions, thereby
maintaining cell integrity.

Rcd4 is a poorly characterized Drosophila centriole component whose mammalian
counterpart, PPP1R35, is suggested to function in centriole elongation and
conversion to centrosomes. Here, we show that rcd4 mutants exhibit fewer
centrioles, aberrant mitoses, and reduced basal bodies in sensory organs. Rcd4
interacts with the C-terminal part of Ana3, which loads onto the procentriole
during interphase, ahead of Rcd4 and before mitosis. Accordingly, depletion of
Ana3 prevents Rcd4 recruitment but not vice versa. We find that neither Ana3 nor 
Rcd4 participates directly in the mitotic conversion of centrioles to
centrosomes, but both are required to load Ana1, which is essential for such
conversion. Whereas ana3 mutants are male sterile, reflecting a requirement for
Ana3 for centriole development in the male germ line, rcd4 mutants are fertile
and have male germ line centrioles of normal length. Thus, Rcd4 is essential in
somatic cells but is not absolutely required in spermatogenesis, indicating
tissue-specific roles in centriole and basal body formation.

In mammals, argonaute (AGO) proteins have been characterized for their roles in
small RNA-mediated posttranscriptional and also in transcriptional gene
silencing. Here, we report a different role for AGO1 in estradiol-triggered
transcriptional activation in human cells. We show that in MCF-7 mammary gland
cells, AGO1 associates with transcriptional enhancers of estrogen receptor α
(ERα) and that this association is up-regulated by treating the cells with
estrogen (E2), displaying a positive correlation with the activation of these
enhancers. Moreover, we show that AGO1 interacts with ERα and that this
interaction is also increased by E2 treatment, but occurs in the absence of RNA. 
We show that AGO1 acts positively as a coactivator in estradiol-triggered
transcription regulation by promoting ERα binding to its enhancers. Consistently,
AGO1 depletion decreases long-range contacts between ERα enhancers and their
target promoters. Our results point to a role of AGO1 in transcriptional
regulation in human cells that is independent from small RNA binding.

Excessive accumulation of collagen leads to fibrosis. Integrin α1β1 (Itgα1β1)
prevents kidney fibrosis by reducing collagen production through inhibition of
the EGF receptor (EGFR) that phosphorylates cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. To 
elucidate how the Itgα1β1/EGFR axis controls collagen synthesis, we analyzed the 
levels of nuclear tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in WT and Itgα1-null kidney
cells. We show that the phosphorylation of the RNA-DNA binding protein fused in
sarcoma (FUS) is higher in Itgα1-null cells. FUS contains EGFR-targeted
phosphorylation sites and, in Itgα1-null cells, activated EGFR promotes FUS
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Nuclear FUS binds to the collagen IV
promoter, commencing gene transcription that is reduced by inhibiting EGFR,
down-regulating FUS, or expressing FUS mutated in the EGFR-targeted
phosphorylation sites. Finally, a cell-penetrating peptide that inhibits FUS
nuclear translocation reduces FUS nuclear content and collagen IV transcription. 
Thus, EGFR-mediated FUS phosphorylation regulates FUS nuclear translocation and
transcription of a major profibrotic collagen gene. Targeting FUS nuclear
translocation offers a new antifibrotic therapy.

The tumor suppressor PTEN is essential for early development. Its lipid
phosphatase activity converts PIP3 to PIP2 and antagonizes the PI3K-Akt pathway. 
In this study, we demonstrate that PTEN's protein phosphatase activity is
required for epiblast epithelial differentiation and polarization. This is
accomplished by reconstitution of PTEN-null embryoid bodies with PTEN mutants
that lack only PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity or both PTEN's lipid and protein
phosphatase activities. Phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitation and mass
spectrometry were used to identify Abi1, a core component of the WASP-family
verprolin homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), as a new PTEN
substrate. We demonstrate that PTEN dephosphorylation of Abi1 at Y213 and S216
results in Abi1 degradation through the calpain pathway. This leads to
down-regulation of the WRC and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The
latter is critical to the transformation of nonpolar pluripotent stem cells into 
the polarized epiblast epithelium. Our findings establish a link between PTEN and
WAVE-Arp2/3-regulated actin cytoskeletal dynamics in epithelial morphogenesis.

Tumor cells exposed to a physiological matrix of type I collagen fibers form
elongated collagenolytic invadopodia, which differ from dotty-like invadopodia
forming on the gelatin substratum model. The related scaffold proteins, TKS5 and 
TKS4, are key components of the mechanism of invadopodia assembly. The molecular 
events through which TKS proteins direct collagenolytic invadopodia formation are
poorly defined. Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, identification of bound 
proteins by mass spectrometry, and in vitro pull-down experiments, we found an
interaction between TKS5 and FGD1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the
Rho-GTPase CDC42, which is known for its role in the assembly of invadopodial
actin core structure. A novel cell polarity network is uncovered comprising TKS5,
FGD1, and CDC42, directing invadopodia formation and the polarization of MT1-MMP 
recycling compartments, required for invadopodia activity and invasion in a 3D
collagen matrix. Additionally, our data unveil distinct signaling pathways
involved in collagenolytic invadopodia formation downstream of TKS4 or TKS5 in

Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that organize synapses by binding to
diverse trans-synaptic ligands, but how neurexins are regulated is incompletely
understood. Here we identify FAM19A/TAFA proteins, "orphan" cytokines, as
neurexin regulators that interact with all neurexins, except for neurexin-1γ, via
an unusual mechanism. Specifically, we show that FAM19A1-A4 bind to the
cysteine-loop domain of neurexins by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds
during transport through the secretory pathway. FAM19A-binding required both the 
cysteines of the cysteine-loop domain and an adjacent sequence of neurexins.
Genetic deletion of neurexins suppressed FAM19A1 expression, demonstrating that
FAM19As physiologically interact with neurexins. In hippocampal cultures,
expression of exogenous FAM19A1 decreased neurexin O-glycosylation and suppressed
its heparan sulfate modification, suggesting that FAM19As regulate the
post-translational modification of neurexins. Given the selective expression of
FAM19As in specific subtypes of neurons and their activity-dependent regulation, 
these results suggest that FAM19As serve as cell type-specific regulators of
neurexin modifications.

NUCKS1 (nuclear ubiquitous casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1)
is a chromatin-associated, vertebrate-specific, and multifunctional protein with 
a role in DNA damage signaling and repair. Previously, we have shown that NUCKS1 
helps maintain homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair in human cells and
functions as a tumor suppressor in mice. However, the mechanisms by which NUCKS1 
positively impacts these processes had remained unclear. Here, we show that
NUCKS1 physically and functionally interacts with the DNA motor protein RAD54.
Upon exposure of human cells to DNA-damaging agents, NUCKS1 controls the
resolution of RAD54 foci. In unperturbed cells, NUCKS1 prevents RAD54's
inappropriate engagement with RAD51AP1. In vitro, NUCKS1 stimulates the ATPase
activity of RAD54 and the RAD51-RAD54-mediated strand invasion step during
displacement loop formation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the NUCKS1
protein is an important new regulator of the spatiotemporal events in HR.

The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular hub of lipid metabolism, coordinating
lipid synthesis with continuous changes in metabolic flux. Maintaining ER lipid
homeostasis despite these fluctuations is crucial to cell function and viability.
Here, we identify a novel mechanism that is crucial for normal ER lipid
metabolism and protects the ER from dysfunction. We identify the molecular
function of the evolutionarily conserved ER protein FIT2 as a fatty acyl-coenzyme
A (CoA) diphosphatase that hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl
4'-phosphopantetheine. This activity of FIT2, which is predicted to be active in 
the ER lumen, is required in yeast and mammalian cells for maintaining ER
structure, protecting against ER stress, and enabling normal lipid storage in
lipid droplets. Our findings thus solve the long-standing mystery of the
molecular function of FIT2 and highlight the maintenance of optimal fatty
acyl-CoA levels as key to ER homeostasis.

Spatial and temporal control of targeting Polo-like kinase during meiotic
prophase.

(1)Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.

Polo-like kinases (PLKs) play widely conserved roles in orchestrating meiotic
chromosome dynamics. However, how PLKs are targeted to distinct subcellular
localizations during meiotic progression remains poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate that the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK-1 primes the recruitment of
PLK-2 to the synaptonemal complex (SC) through phosphorylation of SYP-1 in C.
elegans. SYP-1 phosphorylation by CDK-1 occurs just before meiotic onset.
However, PLK-2 docking to the SC is prevented by the nucleoplasmic HAL-2/3
complex until crossover designation, which constrains PLK-2 to special
chromosomal regions known as pairing centers to ensure proper homologue pairing
and synapsis. PLK-2 is targeted to crossover sites primed by CDK-1 and spreads
along the SC by reinforcing SYP-1 phosphorylation on one side of each crossover
only when threshold levels of crossovers are generated. Thus, the integration of 
chromosome-autonomous signaling and a nucleus-wide crossover-counting mechanism
partitions holocentric chromosomes relative to the crossover site, which
ultimately defines the pattern of chromosome segregation during meiosis I.

Proteins of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family control cell and tissue
morphogenesis. We previously reported that moesin, the only ERM in Drosophila,
controls mitotic morphogenesis and epithelial integrity. We also found that the
Pp1-87B phosphatase dephosphorylates moesin, counteracting its activation by the 
Ste20-like kinase Slik. To understand how this signaling pathway is itself
regulated, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen, looking for new regulators of 
moesin activity. We identified that Slik is a new member of the
striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex (STRIPAK). We discovered that
the phosphatase activity of STRIPAK reduces Slik phosphorylation to promote its
cortical association and proper activation of moesin. Consistent with this
finding, inhibition of STRIPAK phosphatase activity causes cell morphology
defects in mitosis and impairs epithelial tissue integrity. Our results implicate
the Slik-STRIPAK complex in the control of multiple morphogenetic processes.

In neurons, dendrites form the major sites of information receipt and
integration. It is thus vital that, during development, the dendritic arbor is
adequately formed to enable proper neural circuit formation and function. While
several known processes shape the arbor, little is known of those that govern
dendrite branching versus extension. Here, we report a new mechanism instructing 
dendrites to branch versus extend. In it, glutamate signaling activates mGluR5
receptors to promote Ckd5-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal PDZ-binding 
motif of delta-catenin. The phosphorylation state of this motif determines
delta-catenin's ability to bind either Pdlim5 or Magi1. Whereas the delta:Pdlim5 
complex enhances dendrite branching at the expense of elongation, the delta:Magi1
complex instead promotes lengthening. Our data suggest that these complexes
affect dendrite development by differentially regulating the small-GTPase RhoA
and actin-associated protein Cortactin. We thus reveal a "phospho-switch" within 
delta-catenin, subject to a glutamate-mediated signaling pathway, that assists in
balancing the branching versus extension of dendrites during neural development.

Dendrite pathology is frequently observed in various neurodegenerative diseases
(NDs). Although previous studies identified several pathogenic mediators of
dendrite defects that act through loss of function in NDs, the underlying
pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, our search for additional 
pathogenic contributors to dendrite defects in NDs identifies Relish/NF-κB as a
novel gain-of-toxicity-based mediator of dendrite defects in animal models for
polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a
Drosophila model for polyQ diseases, polyQ-induced dendrite defects require
Dredd/Caspase-8-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage of Relish to generate the
N-terminal fragment, Rel68, and subsequent Charon-mediated nuclear localization
of Rel68. Rel68 alone induced neuronal toxicity causing dendrite and behavioral
defects, and we identify two novel transcriptional targets, Tup and Pros, that
mediate Rel68-induced neuronal toxicity. Finally, we show that Rel68-induced
toxicity also contributes to dendrite and behavioral defects in a Drosophila
model for ALS. Collectively, our data propose disinhibition of latent toxicity of
Relish/NF-κB as a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying dendrite pathology in
NDs.

Primary cilia function as critical signaling hubs whose absence leads to severe
disorders collectively known as ciliopathies; our knowledge of ciliogenesis
remains limited. We show that Smo induces ciliogenesis through two distinct yet
essential noncanonical Hh pathways in several cell types, including neurons.
Surprisingly, ligand activation of Smo induces autophagy via an LKB1-AMPK axis to
remove the satellite pool of OFD1. This is required, but not sufficient, for
ciliogenesis. Additionally, Smo activates the Gαi-LGN-NuMA-dynein axis, causing
accumulation of a portion of OFD1 at centrioles in early ciliogenesis. Both
pathways are critical for redistribution of BBS4 from satellites to centrioles,
which is also mediated by OFD1 centriolar translocation. Notably, different Smo
agonists, which activate Smo distinctly, activate one or the other of these
pathways; only in combination they recapitulate the activity of Hh ligand. These 
studies provide new insight into physiological stimuli (Hh) that activate
autophagy and promote ciliogenesis and introduce a novel role for the
Gαi-LGN-NuMA-dynein complex in this process.

An ATM-Chk2-INCENP pathway activates the abscission checkpoint.

Comment in
    J Cell Biol. 2021 Feb 1;220(2):.

During cell division, in response to chromatin bridges, the chromosomal passenger
complex (CPC) delays abscission to prevent chromosome breakage or
tetraploidization. Here, we show that inhibition of ATM or Chk2 kinases impairs
CPC localization to the midbody center, accelerates midbody resolution in
normally segregating cells, and correlates with premature abscission and
chromatin breakage in cytokinesis with trapped chromatin. In cultured human
cells, ATM activates Chk2 at late midbodies. In turn, Chk2 phosphorylates human
INCENP-Ser91 to promote INCENP binding to Mklp2 kinesin and CPC localization to
the midbody center through Mklp2 association with Cep55. Expression of truncated 
Mklp2 that does not bind to Cep55 or nonphosphorylatable INCENP-Ser91A impairs
CPC midbody localization and accelerates abscission. In contrast, expression of
phosphomimetic INCENP-Ser91D or a chimeric INCENP protein that is targeted to the
midbody center rescues the abscission delay in Chk2-deficient or ATM-deficient
cells. Furthermore, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex is required for ATM activation
at the midbody in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges. These results identify an
ATM-Chk2-INCENP pathway that imposes the abscission checkpoint by regulating CPC 
midbody localization.

Receptor degradation terminates signaling by activated receptor tyrosine kinases.
Degradation of EGFR occurs in lysosomes and requires the switching of RAB5 for
RAB7 on late endosomes to enable their fusion with the lysosome, but what
controls this critical switching is poorly understood. We show that the tyrosine 
kinase FER alters PKCδ function by phosphorylating it on Y374, and that
phospho-Y374-PKCδ prevents RAB5 release from nascent late endosomes, thereby
inhibiting EGFR degradation and promoting the recycling of endosomal EGFR to the 
cell surface. The rapid association of phospho-Y374-PKCδ with EGFR-containing
endosomes is diminished by PTPN14, which dephosphorylates phospho-Y374-PKCδ. In
triple-negative breast cancer cells, the FER-dependent phosphorylation of PKCδ
enhances EGFR signaling and promotes anchorage-independent cell growth.
Importantly, increased Y374-PKCδ phosphorylation correlating with arrested late
endosome maturation was identified in ∼25% of triple-negative breast cancer
patients, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to their
pathology.

Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer. We now
demonstrate that loss of function of the endosomal GTPase Rab35 in human brain
tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increases glioblastoma growth and decreases animal
survival following BTIC implantation in mouse brains. Mechanistically, we
identify that the GTPase Arf5 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) for Rab35, DENND1/connecdenn, and allosterically enhances its GEF
activity toward Rab35. Knockdown of either Rab35 or Arf5 increases cell
migration, invasiveness, and self-renewal in culture and enhances the growth and 
invasiveness of BTIC-initiated brain tumors in mice. RNAseq of the tumors reveals
up-regulation of the tumor-promoting transcription factor SPOCD1, and disruption 
of the Arf5/Rab35 axis in glioblastoma cells leads to strong activation of the
epidermal growth factor receptor, with resulting enhancement of SPOCD1 levels.
These discoveries reveal an unexpected cascade between an Arf and a Rab and
indicate a role for the cascade, and thus endosomal trafficking, in brain tumors.

The small noncoding vault RNA (vtRNA) is a component of the vault complex, a
ribonucleoprotein complex found in most eukaryotes. Emerging evidence suggests
that vtRNAs may be involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions 
when unassociated with the vault complex. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for
vtRNA in synaptogenesis. Using an in vitro synapse formation model, we show that 
murine vtRNA (mvtRNA) promotes synapse formation by modulating the MAPK signaling
pathway. mvtRNA is transported to the distal region of neurites as part of the
vault complex. Interestingly, mvtRNA is released from the vault complex in the
neurite by a mitotic kinase Aurora-A-dependent phosphorylation of MVP, a major
protein component of the vault complex. mvtRNA binds to and activates MEK1 and
thereby enhances MEK1-mediated ERK activation in neurites. These results suggest 
the existence of a regulatory mechanism of the MAPK signaling pathway by vtRNAs
as a new molecular basis for synapse formation.

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for embryonic development and adult
homeostasis. How its signaling activity is fine-tuned in response to fluctuated
Hh gradient is less known. Here, we identify protein phosphatase V (PpV), the
catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6, as a homeostatic regulator of Hh
signaling. PpV is genetically upstream of widerborst (wdb), which encodes a
regulatory subunit of PP2A that modulates high-level Hh signaling. We show that
PpV negatively regulates Wdb stability independent of phosphatase activity of
PpV, by competing with the catalytic subunit of PP2A for Wdb association, leading
to Wdb ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, regulated Wdb
stability, maintained through competition between two closely related
phosphatases, ensures graded Hh signaling. Interestingly, PpV expression is
regulated by Hh signaling. Therefore, PpV functions as a Hh activity sensor that 
regulates Wdb-mediated PP2A activity through feedback mechanisms to maintain Hh
signaling homeostasis.

The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is mainly localized to the vacuolar
membrane and regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to nutrient
availability. To obtain deeper insights into the functional roles of TORC1, we
performed a genome-wide analysis of the TORC1 interactome in yeast using the
bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. We found that while most
of the BiFC signals are observed at the vacuolar membrane, a fraction of them are
detected at cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules. Moreover,
mRNA-binding proteins are enriched in the TORC1 interactome, suggesting a
functional relationship between TORC1 and mRNA metabolism. We show that a portion
of TORC1 is consistently associated with mRNP complexes and interacts with a
specific subset of mRNAs. We also demonstrate that TORC1 directly targets a
translational repressor Scd6 and that the activity of Scd6 is inhibited by
TORC1-dependent phosphorylation. Collectively, our data suggest that TORC1 plays

Endocytosed proteins can be delivered to lysosomes for degradation or recycled to
either the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane. It remains poorly
understood how the recycling versus degradation of cargoes is determined. Here,
we show that multiple extracellular stimuli, including starvation, LPS, IL-6, and
EGF treatment, can strongly inhibit endocytic recycling of multiple cargoes
through the activation of MAPK11/14. The stress-induced kinases in turn directly 
phosphorylate SNX27, a key regulator of endocytic recycling, at serine 51
(Ser51). Phosphorylation of SNX27 at Ser51 alters the conformation of its
cargo-binding pocket and decreases the interaction between SNX27 and cargo
proteins, thereby inhibiting endocytic recycling. Our study indicates that
endocytic recycling is highly dynamic and can crosstalk with cellular
stress-signaling pathways. Suppression of endocytic recycling and enhancement of 
receptor lysosomal degradation serve as new mechanisms for cells to cope with
stress and save energy.

Tight regulation of the APC/C-Cdc20 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B1 for
degradation is important for mitotic fidelity. The spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC) inhibits Cdc20 through the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). In addition,
phosphorylation of Cdc20 by cyclin B1-Cdk1 independently inhibits APC/C-Cdc20
activation. This creates a conundrum for how Cdc20 is activated before cyclin B1 
degradation. Here, we show that the MCC component BubR1 harbors both Cdc20
inhibition and activation activities, allowing for cross-talk between the two
Cdc20 inhibition pathways. Specifically, BubR1 acts as a substrate specifier for 
PP2A-B56 to enable efficient Cdc20 dephosphorylation in the MCC. A mutant Cdc20
mimicking the dephosphorylated state escapes a mitotic checkpoint arrest, arguing
that restricting Cdc20 dephosphorylation to the MCC is important. Collectively,
our work reveals how Cdc20 can be dephosphorylated in the presence of cyclin
B1-Cdk1 activity without causing premature anaphase onset.

A hallmark of aging is immunosenescence, a decline in immune functions, which
appeared to be inevitable in living organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Here, we show that genetic inhibition of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor
drastically enhances immunocompetence in old age in C. elegans. We demonstrate
that longevity-promoting DAF-16/FOXO and heat-shock transcription factor 1
(HSF-1) increase immunocompetence in old daf-2(-) animals. In contrast, p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (PMK-1), a key determinant of immunity, is
only partially required for this rejuvenated immunity. The up-regulation of
DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 decreases the expression of the zip-10/bZIP transcription
factor, which in turn down-regulates INS-7, an agonistic insulin-like peptide,
resulting in further reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). Thus, reduced
IIS prevents immune aging via the up-regulation of anti-aging transcription
factors that modulate an endocrine insulin-like peptide through a feedforward
mechanism. Because many functions of IIS are conserved across phyla, our study
may lead to the development of strategies against immune aging in humans.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are critical for lipid storage and energy metabolism. LDs
form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the molecular basis for LD
biogenesis remains elusive. Here, we show that fat storage-inducing transmembrane
protein 2 (FIT2) interacts with ER tubule-forming proteins Rtn4 and REEP5. The
association is mainly transmembrane domain based and stimulated by oleic acid.
Depletion of ER tubule-forming proteins decreases the number and size of LDs in
cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, mimicking loss of FIT2. Through cytosolic
loops, FIT2 binds to cytoskeletal protein septin 7, an interaction that is also
required for normal LD biogenesis. Depletion of ER tubule-forming proteins or
septins delays nascent LD formation. In addition, FIT2-interacting proteins are
up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation, and ER tubule-forming proteins,
septin 7, and FIT2 are transiently enriched at LD formation sites. Thus,
FIT2-mediated nascent LD biogenesis is facilitated by ER tubule-forming proteins 
and septins.

The polarisome is a cortical proteinaceous microcompartment that organizes the
growth of actin filaments and the fusion of secretory vesicles in yeasts and
filamentous fungi. Polarisomes are compact, spotlike structures at the growing
tips of their respective cells. The molecular forces that control the form and
size of this microcompartment are not known. Here we identify a complex between
the polarisome subunit Pea2 and the type V Myosin Myo2 that anchors Myo2 at the
cortex of yeast cells. We discovered a point mutation in the cargo-binding domain
of Myo2 that impairs the interaction with Pea2 and consequently the formation and
focused localization of the polarisome. Cells carrying this mutation grow round
instead of elongated buds. Further experiments and biophysical modeling suggest
that the interactions between polarisome-bound Myo2 motors and dynamic actin
filaments spatially focus the polarisome and sustain its compact shape.

Rac1 GTPase is hyperactivated in tumors and contributes to malignancy. Rac1
disruption of junctions requires its effector PAK1, but the precise mechanisms
are unknown. Here, we show that E-cadherin is internalized via micropinocytosis
in a PAK1-dependent manner without catenin dissociation and degradation. In
addition to internalization, PAK1 regulates E-cadherin transport by fine-tuning
Rab small GTPase function. PAK1 phosphorylates a core Rab regulator, RabGDIβ, but
not RabGDIα. Phosphorylated RabGDIβ preferentially associates with Rab5 and
Rab11, which is predicted to promote Rab retrieval from membranes. Consistent
with this hypothesis, Rab11 is activated by Rac1, and inhibition of Rab11
function partially rescues E-cadherin destabilization. Thus, Rac1 activation
reduces surface cadherin levels as a net result of higher bulk flow of membrane
uptake that counteracts Rab11-dependent E-cadherin delivery to junctions
(recycling and/or exocytosis). This unique small GTPase crosstalk has an impact
on Rac1 and PAK1 regulation of membrane remodeling during epithelial
dedifferentiation, adhesion, and motility.

The Golgi complex is essential for the processing, sorting, and trafficking of
newly synthesized proteins and lipids. Golgi turnover is regulated to meet
different cellular physiological demands. The role of autophagy in the turnover
of Golgi, however, has not been clarified. Here we show that CALCOCO1 binds the
Golgi-resident palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC17 to facilitate Golgi degradation by
autophagy during starvation. Depletion of CALCOCO1 in cells causes expansion of
the Golgi and accumulation of its structural and membrane proteins. ZDHHC17
itself is degraded by autophagy together with other Golgi membrane proteins such 
as TMEM165. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which CALCOCO1 mediates
selective Golgiphagy to control Golgi size and morphology in eukaryotic cells via
its interaction with ZDHHC17.

During mitosis, sister chromatids attach to microtubules from opposite poles,
called biorientation. Sister chromatid cohesion resists microtubule forces,
generating tension, which provides the signal that biorientation has occurred.
How tension silences the surveillance pathways that prevent cell cycle
progression and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments remains
unclear. Here we show that SUMOylation dampens error correction to allow stable
sister kinetochore biorientation and timely anaphase onset. The Siz1/Siz2 SUMO
ligases modify the pericentromere-localized shugoshin (Sgo1) protein before its
tension-dependent release from chromatin. Sgo1 SUMOylation reduces its binding to
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and weakening of this interaction is important for
stable biorientation. Unstable biorientation in SUMO-deficient cells is
associated with persistence of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) at
centromeres, and SUMOylation of CPC subunit Bir1 also contributes to timely
anaphase onset. We propose that SUMOylation acts in a combinatorial manner to
facilitate dismantling of the error correction machinery within pericentromeres
and thereby sharpen the metaphase-anaphase transition.

Rab40b is a SOCS box-containing protein that regulates the secretion of MMPs to
facilitate extracellular matrix remodeling during cell migration. Here, we show
that Rab40b interacts with Cullin5 via the Rab40b SOCS domain. We demonstrate
that loss of Rab40b-Cullin5 binding decreases cell motility and invasive
potential and show that defective cell migration and invasion stem from
alteration to the actin cytoskeleton, leading to decreased invadopodia formation,
decreased actin dynamics at the leading edge, and an increase in stress fibers.
We also show that these stress fibers anchor at less dynamic, more stable focal
adhesions. Mechanistically, changes in the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion
dynamics are mediated in part by EPLIN, which we demonstrate to be a binding
partner of Rab40b and a target for Rab40b-Cullin5-dependent localized
ubiquitylation and degradation. Thus, we propose a model where
Rab40b-Cullin5-dependent ubiquitylation regulates EPLIN localization to promote
cell migration and invasion by altering focal adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics.

The ER tethers tightly to mitochondria and the mitochondrial protein FUNDC1
recruits Drp1 to ER-mitochondria contact sites, subsequently facilitating
mitochondrial fission and preventing mitochondria from undergoing hypoxic stress.
However, the mechanisms by which the ER modulates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial
fission are poorly understood. Here, we show that USP19, an ER-resident
deubiquitinase, accumulates at ER-mitochondria contact sites under hypoxia and
promotes hypoxia-induced mitochondrial division. In response to hypoxia, USP19
binds to and deubiquitinates FUNDC1 at ER-mitochondria contact sites, which
facilitates Drp1 oligomerization and Drp1 GTP-binding and hydrolysis activities, 
thereby promoting mitochondrial division. Our findings reveal a unique hypoxia
response pathway mediated by an ER protein that regulates mitochondrial dynamics.

Circadian rhythms regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, but circadian 
control of tissue regeneration remains elusive at the molecular level. Here, we
show that proper myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration are regulated
by the circadian master regulators Per1 and Per2. Depletion of Per1 or Per2
suppressed myoblast differentiation in vitro and muscle regeneration in vivo,
demonstrating their nonredundant functions. Both Per1 and Per2 were required for 
the activation of Igf2, an autocrine promoter of myoblast differentiation,
accompanied by Per-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II, dynamic histone
modifications at the Igf2 promoter and enhancer, and the promoter-enhancer
interaction. This circadian epigenetic priming created a preferred time window
for initiating myoblast differentiation. Consistently, muscle regeneration was
faster if initiated at night, when Per1, Per2, and Igf2 were highly expressed
compared with morning. This study reveals the circadian timing as a significant
factor for effective muscle cell differentiation and regeneration.

ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts are proposed to be held together by distinct
families of tethering proteins, which in yeast include the VAP homologues
Scs2/22, the extended-synaptotagmin homologues Tcb1/2/3, and the TMEM16 homologue
Ist2. It is unclear whether these tethers act redundantly or whether individual
tethers have specific functions at contacts. Here, we show that Ist2 directly
recruits the phosphatidylserine (PS) transport proteins and ORP family members
Osh6 and Osh7 to ER-PM contacts through a binding site located in Ist2's
disordered C-terminal tethering region. This interaction is required for
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) production by the PS decarboxylase Psd2, whereby PS
transported from the ER to the PM by Osh6/7 is endocytosed to the site of Psd2 in
endosomes/Golgi/vacuoles. This role for Ist2 and Osh6/7 in nonvesicular PS
transport is specific, as other tethers/transport proteins do not compensate.
Thus, we identify a molecular link between the ORP and TMEM16 families and a role
for endocytosis of PS in PE synthesis.

The Hedgehog pathway, critical to vertebrate development, is organized in primary
cilia. Activation of signaling causes the Hedgehog receptor Ptch1 to exit cilia, 
allowing a second receptor, Smo, to accumulate in cilia and activate the
downstream steps of the pathway. Mechanisms regulating the dynamics of these
receptors are unknown, but the ubiquitination of Smo regulates its interaction
with the intraflagellar transport system to control ciliary levels. A focused
screen of ubiquitin-related genes identified nine required for maintaining low
ciliary Smo at the basal state. These included cytoplasmic E3s (Arih2, Mgrn1, and
Maea), a ciliary localized E3 (Wwp1), a ciliary localized E2 (Ube2l3), a
deubiquitinase (Bap1), and three adaptors (Kctd5, Skp1a, and Skp2). The ciliary
E3, Wwp1, binds Ptch1 and localizes to cilia at the basal state. Activation of
signaling removes both Ptch1 and Wwp1 from cilia, thus providing an elegant
mechanism for Ptch1 to regulate ciliary Smo levels.

Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal forms of adult cancer, with a median
survival of ∼15 mo. Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) at the origin
of tumor formation and relapse may prove beneficial. In situ, GSCs are nested
within the vascular bed in tight interaction with brain endothelial cells, which 
positively control their expansion. Because GSCs are notably addicted to apelin
(APLN), sourced from the surrounding endothelial stroma, the APLN/APLNR nexus has
emerged as a druggable network. However, how this signaling axis operates in
gliomagenesis remains underestimated. Here, we find that the glycoprotein GP130
interacts with APLNR at the plasma membrane of GSCs and arbitrates its
availability at the surface via ELMOD1, which may further impact on ARF-mediated 
endovesicular trafficking. From a functional standpoint, interfering with GP130
thwarts APLNR-mediated self-renewal of GSCs ex vivo. Thus, GP130 emerges as an
unexpected cicerone to the G protein-coupled APLN receptor, opening new
therapeutic perspectives toward the targeting of cancer stem cells.

Mitochondrial movement and distribution are fundamental to their function. Here
we report a mechanism that regulates mitochondrial movement by anchoring
mitochondria to the F-actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism is activated by an
increase in glucose influx and the consequent O-GlcNAcylation of TRAK (Milton), a
component of the mitochondrial motor-adaptor complex. The protein four and a half
LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) serves as the anchor. FHL2 associates with
O-GlcNAcylated TRAK and is both necessary and sufficient to drive the
accumulation of F-actin around mitochondria and to arrest mitochondrial movement 
by anchoring to F-actin. Disruption of F-actin restores mitochondrial movement
that had been arrested by either TRAK O-GlcNAcylation or forced direction of FHL2
to mitochondria. This pathway for mitochondrial immobilization is present in both
neurons and non-neuronal cells and can thereby adapt mitochondrial dynamics to
changes in glucose availability.

Progranulin (PGRN) is an autocrine growth factor that exerts crucial roles within
cartilage tissue; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying PGRN-mediated
cartilage homeostasis remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the
role of PGRN in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its therapeutic potential 
for managing osteoarthritis (OA). We found that PGRN levels are significantly
increased in human cartilage in mild OA and that its expression is decreased in
the cartilage in severe OA. In vitro, treatment of primary rat chondrocytes with 
recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of collagen type II α 1 chain 
(COL2A1) and aggrecan, and attenuated TNFα-induced up-regulation of matrix
metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 
motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. These effects were abrogated in SIRT1-/-
cells, indicating a causative role of SIRT1 in the effects of PGRN on protein
expression in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and 
activity, which reduced the acetylation levels of SRY-box transcription factor
(SOX9) and transcription factor P65 (P65) and thereby promoted nuclear
translocation of SOX9 and inhibited TNFα-induced P65 nuclear accumulation to
maintain chondrocyte homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism 
of action for PGRN that maintains cartilage homeostasis and supports the notion
that PGRN up-regulation may be a promising strategy for managing OA.

Astrocytes perform multiple essential functions in the developing and mature
brain, including regulation of synapse formation, control of neurotransmitter
release and uptake, and maintenance of extracellular ion balance. As a result,
astrocytes have been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
Despite these critical functions, the study of human astrocytes can be difficult 
because standard differentiation protocols are time-consuming and technically
challenging, but a differentiation protocol recently developed in our laboratory 
enables the efficient derivation of astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells.
We used this protocol along with microarrays, luciferase assays, electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays, and ChIP assays to explore the genes involved in astrocyte
differentiation. We demonstrate that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor
1 (PITX1) is critical for astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 overexpression induced
early differentiation of astrocytes, and its knockdown blocked astrocyte
differentiation. PITX1 overexpression also increased and PITX1 knockdown
decreased expression of sex-determining region Y box 9 (SOX9), known initiator of
gliogenesis, during early astrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we determined that
PITX1 activates the SOX9 promoter through a unique binding motif. Taken together,
these findings indicate that PITX1 drives astrocyte differentiation by sustaining
activation of the SOX9 promoter.

The evolutionarily conserved multiprotein Mediator complex (MED) serves as an
interface between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) and the RNA Pol II
machinery. It has been proposed that each TF interacts with a dedicated MED
subunit to induce specific transcriptional responses. But are these binary
partnerships sufficient to mediate TF functions? We have previously established
that the Med1 Mediator subunit serves as a cofactor of GATA TFs in Drosophila, as
shown in mammals. Here, we observe mutant phenotype similarities between another 
subunit, Med19, and the Drosophila GATA TF Pannier (Pnr), suggesting functional
interaction. We further show that Med19 physically interacts with the Drosophila 
GATA TFs, Pnr and Serpent (Srp), in vivo and in vitro through their conserved
C-zinc finger domains. Moreover, Med19 loss of function experiments in vivo or in
cellulo indicate that it is required for Pnr- and Srp-dependent gene expression, 
suggesting general GATA cofactor functions. Interestingly, Med19 but not Med1 is 
critical for the regulation of all tested GATA target genes, implying shared or
differential use of MED subunits by GATAs depending on the target gene. Lastly,
we show a direct interaction between Med19 and Med1 by GST pulldown experiments
indicating privileged contacts between these two subunits of the MED middle
module. Together, these findings identify Med19/Med1 as a composite GATA TF
interface and suggest that binary MED subunit-TF partnerships are probably
oversimplified models. We propose several mechanisms to account for the
transcriptional regulation of GATA-targeted genes.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in the coevolution of
breast tumor cells and their microenvironment by modifying cellular compartments 
and regulating cancer cell functions via stromal-epithelial dialogue. However,
the relationship and interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is still
poorly understood. Herein, we revealed that breast cancer cells have a stronger
ability to activate fibroblasts and transform them into myofibroblasts (CAF-like)
than normal breast epithelial cells, and this stronger ability occurs through
paracrine signaling. In turn, myofibroblasts promote the proliferation,
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells. 
Detailed regulatory mechanisms showed that, compared with normal cells, Survivin 
is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and secreted extracellularly in the form 
of exosomes, which are then internalized by fibroblasts. Breast cancer
cell-derived survivin up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts and then
converts them into myofibroblasts, conversely inducing breast cancer progression 
in vitro and in vivo Thus, our results indicate that survivin acts as an
activator of the tumor microenvironment and that SOD1 up-regulation in
fibroblasts can promote breast cancer progression. These results suggest that
targeting survivin and SOD1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast
cancer.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosome instability syndrome of children caused by
inherited mutations in one of FA genes, which together constitute a DNA
interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, or the FA pathway. Monoubiquitination of
Fanconi anemia group D2 protein (FANCD2) by the multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase,
the FA core complex, is an obligate step in activation of the FA pathway, and its
activity needs to be tightly regulated. FAAP20 is a key structural component of
the FA core complex, and regulated proteolysis of FAAP20 mediated by prolyl
cis-trans isomerization and phosphorylation at a consensus phosphodegron motif is
essential for preserving the integrity of the FA core complex, and thus FANCD2
monoubiquitination. However, how ubiquitin-dependent FAAP20 degradation is
modulated to fine-tune FA pathway activation remains largely un-known. Here, we
present evidence that FAAP20 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP on
lysine 152, the key residue that when polyubiquitinated results in the
degradation of FAAP20. Acetylation or mutation of the lysine residue stabilizes
FAAP20 by preventing its ubiquitination, thereby protecting it from
proteasome-dependent FAAP20 degradation. Consequently, disruption of the FAAP20
acetylation pathway impairs FANCD2 activation. Together, our study reveals a
competition mechanism between ubiquitination and acetylation of a common lysine
residue that controls FAAP20 stability and highlights a complex balancing between
different posttranslational modifications as a way to refine the FA pathway
signaling required for DNA ICL repair and genome stability.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling plays an important role in
regulating tumor malignancy, including in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
major biological responses of TGFβ signaling are determined by the effector
proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3. However, the regulators of TGFβ-SMAD signaling are not 
completely revealed yet. Here, we showed that the scaffolding protein PDLIM5 (PDZ
and LIM domain protein 5, ENH) critically promotes TGFβ signaling by maintaining 
SMAD3 stability in NSCLC. First, PDLIM5 was highly expressed in NSCLC compared
with that in adjacent normal tissues, and high PDLIM5 expression was associated
with poor outcome. Knockdown of PDLIM5 in NSCLC cells decreased migration and
invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo In addition, TGFβ signaling and
TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was repressed by PDLIM5 knockdown.
Mechanistically, PDLIM5 knockdown resulted in a reduction of SMAD3 protein
levels. Overexpression of SMAD3 reversed the TGFβ-signaling-repressing and
anti-migration effects induced by PDLIM5 knockdown. Notably, PDLIM5 interacted
with SMAD3 but not SMAD2 and competitively suppressed the interaction between
SMAD3 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1. Therefore, PDLIM5 protected SMAD3 from
STUB1-mediated proteasome degradation. STUB1 knockdown restored SMAD3 protein
levels, cell migration, and invasion in PDLIM5-knockdown cells. Collectively, our
findings indicate that PDLIM5 is a novel regulator of basal SMAD3 stability, with
implications for controlling TGFβ signaling and NSCLC progression.

Transcriptional repressor zinc finger and BTB domain containing 1 (ZBTB1) is
required for DNA repair. Because DNA repair defects often underlie genome
instability and tumorigenesis, we determined to study the role of ZBTB1 in
cancer. In this study, we found that ZBTB1 is down-regulated in breast cancer and
this down-regulation is associated with poor outcome of breast cancer patients.
ZBTB1 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. The majority 
of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and selective estrogen
receptor modulators such as tamoxifen have been widely used in the treatment of
these patients. Unfortunately, many patients develop resistance to endocrine
therapy. Tamoxifen-resistant cancer cells often exhibit higher HER2 expression
and an increase of glycolysis. Our data revealed that ZBTB1 plays a critical role
in tamoxifen resistance in vitro and in vivo To see if ZBTB1 regulates HER2
expression, we tested the recruitments of ZBTB1 on HER2 regulatory sequences. We 
observed that over-expressed ZBTB1 occupies the estrogen receptor α (ERα)-binding
site of the HER2 intron in tamoxifen-resistant cells, suppressing
tamoxifen-induced transcription. In an effort to identify potential microRNAs
(miRNAs) regulating ZBTB1, we found that miR-23b-3p directly targets ZBTB1.
MiR-23b-3p regulates HER2 expression and tamoxifen resistance via targeting
ZBTB1. Finally, we found that miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 regulates aerobic glycolysis in
tamoxifen-resistant cells. Together, our data demonstrate that ZBTB1 is a tumor
suppressor in breast cancer cells and that targeting the miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 may
serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of tamoxifen
resistant breast cancer.

T-cell activation is a critical part of the adaptive immune system, enabling
responses to foreign cells and external stimulus. In this process, T-cell antigen
receptor (TCR) activation stimulates translocation of the downstream kinase PKCθ 
to the membrane, leading to NF-κB activation and thus transcription of relevant
genes. However, the details of how PKCθ is recruited to the membrane remain
enigmatic. It is known that annexin A5 (ANXA5), a calcium-dependent
membrane-binding protein, has been reported to mediate PKCδ activation by
interaction with PKCδ, a homologue of PKCθ, which implicates a potential role of 
ANXA5 involved in PKCθ signaling. Here we demonstrate that ANXA5 does play a
critical role in the recruitment of PKCθ to the membrane during T-cell
activation. ANXA5 knockout in Jurkat T cells substantially inhibited the membrane
translocation of PKCθ upon TCR engagement and blocked the recruitment of
CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome, which provides a platform for the catalytic
activation of IKKs and subsequent activation of canonical NF-κB signaling in
activated T cells. As a result, NF-κB activation was impaired in ANXA5-KO T
cells. T-cell activation was also suppressed by ANAX5 knockdown in primary T
cells. These results demonstrated a novel role of ANXA5 in PKC translocation and 
PKC signaling during T-cell activation.

Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is a cytosolic antibody receptor 
that targets the internalized virus-antibody complex to the proteasome for
degradation. However, the precise mechanism regulating TRIM21 activity is
unknown. Here we show that TRIM21 is a substrate of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)
and that its function is regulated by acetylation. HDAC6 interacts with TRIM21
through its PRYSPRY motif and deacetylates TRIM21 at lysine 385 and lysine 387,
thus promoting its homodimerization. Inhibiting HDAC6 activity increases TRIM21
acetylation, and hyperacetylation blocks TRIM21 dimerization and ubiquitination, 
preventing its binding to the virus-antibody complex and its degradation via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HDAC6 depletion or inhibition increases virus
accumulation in cells, indicative of an impaired capacity for antibody-dependent 
intracellular neutralization of viruses, whereas TRIM21 acetylation-deficient
K385/387R mutant rescues HDAC6 depletion-caused ADIN impairment. These findings
provide evidence for HDAC6 as a novel regulator of TRIM21-mediated intracellular 
innate immunity.

Surface-exposed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2 and TLR4 survey the
extracellular environment for pathogens. TLR activation initiates the production 
of various cytokines and chemokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I).
Downstream of TLR4, IFNβ secretion is only vigorously triggered in macrophages
when the receptor undergoes endocytosis and switches signaling adaptor; surface
TLR4 engagement predominantly induces proinflammatory cytokines via the signaling
adaptor MyD88. It is unclear whether this dichotomy is generally applicable to
other TLRs, cell types, or differentiation states. Here, we report that diverse
TLR2 ligands induce an IFN-I response in human monocyte-like cells, but not in
differentiated macrophages. This TLR2-dependent IFN-I signaling originates from
the cell surface and depends on MyD88; it involves combined activation of the
transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, driven by the kinases TBK1 and TAK1-IKKβ,
respectively. TLR2-stimulated monocytes produced modest IFNβ levels that caused
productive downstream signaling, reflected by STAT1 phosphorylation and
expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes. Our findings reveal that the 
outcome of TLR2 signaling includes an IFN-I response in human monocytes, which is
lost upon macrophage differentiation, and differs mechanistically from
IFN-I-induction through TLR4. These findings point to molecular mechanisms
tailored to the differentiation state of a cell and the nature of receptors
activated to control and limit TLR-triggered IFN-I responses.

Interaction of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced canonical signaling
with the noncanonical kinase cascades regulates glomerular hypertrophy and matrix
protein deposition, which are early features of glomerulosclerosis. However, the 
specific target downstream of the TGFβ receptor involved in the noncanonical
signaling is unknown. Here, we show that TGFβ increased the catalytic loop
phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), a receptor
tyrosine kinase expressed abundantly in glomerular mesangial cells. TGFβ
increased phosphorylation of the PI 3-kinase-interacting Tyr-751 residue of
PDGFRβ, thus activating Akt. Inhibition of PDGFRβ using a pharmacological
inhibitor and siRNAs blocked TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of proline-rich Akt 
substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), an intrinsic inhibitory component of mTORC1, and
prevented activation of mTORC1 in the absence of any effect on Smad 2/3
phosphorylation. Expression of constitutively active myristoylated Akt reversed
the siPDGFRβ-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 activity; however, co-expression of
the phospho-deficient mutant of PRAS40 inhibited the effect of myristoylated Akt,
suggesting a definitive role of PRAS40 phosphorylation in mTORC1 activation
downstream of PDGFRβ in mesangial cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that
PDGFRβ-initiated phosphorylation of PRAS40 is required for TGFβ-induced mesangial
cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and collagen I (α2) production. Increased
activating phosphorylation of PDGFRβ is also associated with enhanced TGFβ
expression and mTORC1 activation in the kidney cortex and glomeruli of diabetic
mice and rats, respectively. Thus, pursuing TGFβ noncanonical signaling, we
identified how TGFβ receptor I achieves mTORC1 activation through PDGFRβ-mediated
Akt/PRAS40 phosphorylation to spur mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein 
accumulation. These findings provide support for targeting PDGFRβ in TGFβ-driven 
renal fibrosis.

The retina-specific chaperone aryl hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1)
is essential for the correct assembly of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which is a
pivotal effector enzyme for phototransduction and vision because it hydrolyzes
cGMP. AIPL1 interacts with the cytokine-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10, 
which gets covalently conjugated to hundreds of proteins and targets its
conjugation substrates for proteasomal degradation, but whether FAT10 affects
PDE6 function or turnover is unknown. Here, we show that FAT10 mRNA is expressed 
in human retina and identify rod PDE6 as a retina-specific substrate of FAT10
conjugation. We found that AIPL1 stabilizes the FAT10 monomer and the PDE6-FAT10 
conjugate. Additionally, we elucidated the functional consequences of PDE6
FAT10ylation. On the one hand, we demonstrate that FAT10 targets PDE6 for
proteasomal degradation by formation of a covalent isopeptide linkage. On the
other hand, FAT10 inhibits PDE6 cGMP hydrolyzing activity by noncovalently
interacting with the PDE6 GAFa and catalytic domains. Therefore, FAT10 may
contribute to loss of PDE6 and, as a consequence, degeneration of retinal cells
in eye diseases linked to inflammation and inherited blindness-causing mutations 
in AIPL1.

The mitotic kinase Aurora B regulates the condensation of chromatin into
chromosomes by phosphorylating chromatin proteins during early mitosis, whereas
the phosphatase PP1γ performs the opposite function. The roles of Aurora B and
PP1γ must be tightly coordinated to maintain chromosomes at a high
phosphorylation state, but the precise mechanisms regulating their function
remain largely unclear. Here, mainly through immunofluorescence microscopy and
co-immunoprecipitation assays, we find that dissociation of PP1γ from chromosomes
is essential for maintaining chromosome phosphorylation. We uncover that PP1γ is 
recruited to mitotic chromosomes by its regulatory subunit Repo-Man in the
absence of Aurora B activity and that Aurora B regulates dissociation of PP1γ by 
phosphorylating and disrupting PP1γ-Repo-Man interactions on chromatin.
Overexpression of Repo-Man mutants that cannot be phosphorylated or inhibition of
Aurora B kinase activity resulted in the retention of PP1γ on chromatin and
prolonged the chromatin condensation process; a similar outcome was caused by the
ectopic targeting of PP1γ to chromatin. Together, our findings reveal a novel
regulation mechanism of chromatin condensation in which Aurora B counteracts PP1γ
activity by releasing PP1γ from Repo-Man and may have important implications for 
understanding the regulations of dynamic structural changes of the chromosomes in
mitosis.

The biogenesis of mitochondria requires the import of hundreds of precursor
proteins. These proteins are transported post-translationally with the help of
chaperones, meaning that the overproduction of mitochondrial proteins or the
limited availability of chaperones can lead to the accumulation of cytosolic
precursor proteins. This imposes a severe challenge to cytosolic proteostasis and
triggers a specific transcription program called the mitoprotein-induced stress
response, which activates the proteasome system. This coincides with the
repression of mitochondrial proteins, including many proteins of the
intermembrane space. In contrast, herein we report that the
so-far-uncharacterized intermembrane space protein Mix23 is considerably
up-regulated when mitochondrial import is perturbed. Mix23 is evolutionarily
conserved and a homolog of the human protein CCDC58. We found that, like the
subunits of the proteasome, Mix23 is under control of the transcription factor
Rpn4. It is imported into mitochondria by the mitochondrial disulfide relay.
Mix23 is critical for the efficient import of proteins into the mitochondrial
matrix, particularly if the function of the translocase of the inner membrane 23 
is compromised such as in temperature-sensitive mutants of Tim17. Our
observations identify Mix23 as a novel regulator or stabilizer of the
mitochondrial protein import machinery that is specifically up-regulated upon
mitoprotein-induced stress conditions.

Strategies to increase energy expenditure are an attractive approach to reduce
excess fat storage and body weight to improve metabolic health. In mammals,
uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in brown and beige adipocytes uncouples fatty acid
oxidation from ATP generation in mitochondria and promotes energy dissipation as 
heat. We set out to identify small molecules that enhance UCP1 levels and
activity using a high-throughput screen of nearly 12,000 compounds in mouse brown
adipocytes. We identified a family of compounds that increase Ucp1 expression and
mitochondrial activity (including un-coupled respiration) in mouse brown
adipocytes and human brown and white adipocytes. The mechanism of action may be
through compound binding to A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 1, modulating its
localization to mitochondria and its interaction with protein kinase A (PKA), a
known node in the β-adrenergic signaling pathway. In mice, the hit compound
increased body temperature, UCP1 protein levels, and thermogenic gene expression.
Some of the compound effects on mitochondrial function were UCP1- or
AKAP1-independent, suggesting compound effects on multiple nodes of energy
regulation. Overall, our results highlight a role for AKAP1 in thermogenesis,
uncoupled respiration, and regulation energy balance.

Regulation of gene expression at the translational level is key to determining
cell fate and function. An RNA-binding protein, RNG140 (caprin2), plays a role in
eye lens differentiation and has been reported to function in translational
regulation. However, the mechanism and its role in eyes has remained unclear.
Here, we show that RNG140 binds to the translation initiation factor eukaryotic
initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and suppresses translation through mechanisms
involving suppression of eIF3-dependent translation initiation. Comprehensive
ribosome profiling revealed that overexpression of RNG140 in cultured Chinese
hamster ovary cells reduces translation of long mRNAs, including those associated
with cell proliferation. RNG140-mediated translational regulation also operates
in the mouse eye, where RNG140 knockout increased the translation of long mRNAs. 
mRNAs involved in lens differentiation, such as crystallin mRNAs, are short and
can escape translational inhibition by RNG140 and be translated in
differentiating lenses. Thus, this study provides insights into the mechanistic
basis of lens cell transition from proliferation to differentiation via
RNG140-mediated translational regulation.

Previously we reported that adipocyte SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of
23 kDa) deficiency blocks the activation of macroautophagy, leading to an
increased abundance of BAX, a pro-death Bcl-2 family member, and activation and
adipocyte cell death both in vitro and in vivo Here, we found that knockdown of
SNAP23 inhibited the association of the autophagosome regulators ATG16L1 and ATG9
compartments by nutrient depletion and reduced the formation of ATG16L1 membrane 
puncta. ATG16L1 knockdown inhibited autophagy flux and increased BAX protein
levels by suppressing BAX degradation. The elevation in BAX protein had no effect
on BAX activation or cell death in the nutrient-replete state. However, following
nutrient depletion, BAX was activated with a concomitant induction of cell death.
Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that SNAP23 and ATG16L1 proteins
form a stable complex independent of nutrient condition, whereas in the
nutrient-depleted state, BAX binds to SNAP23 to form a ternary BAX-SNAP23-ATG16L1
protein complex. Taken together, these data support a model in which SNAP23 plays
a crucial function as a scaffold for ATG16L1 necessary for the suppression of BAX
activation and induction of the intrinsic cell death program.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) are valuable immunosuppressants for a 
range of clinical settings, including (but not limited to) organ transplantation 
and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. They function by inhibiting the
activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin toward nuclear 
factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) in T-lymphocytes. However, use of CsA is
associated with more serious side effects and worse clinical outcomes than FK506.
Here we show that CsA, but not FK506, causes activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR), an event which is normally an acute reaction to various types of 
intracellular insults, such as nutrient deficiency or endoplasmic reticulum
stress. These effects of CsA involve at least two of the stress-activated protein
kinases (GCN2 and PERK) that act on the translational machinery to slow down
protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)
2α and thereby induce the ISR. These actions of CsA likely contribute to the
adverse effects associated with its clinical application.

Muscle atrophy is regulated by the balance between protein degradation and
synthesis. FOXO1, a transcription factor, helps to determine this balance by
activating pro-atrophic gene transcription when present in muscle fiber nuclei.
Foxo1 nuclear efflux is promoted by AKT-mediated Foxo1 phosphorylation,
eliminating FOXO1's atrophy-promoting effect. AKT activation can be promoted by
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or insulin via a pathway including IGF1 or
insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and AKT. We used confocal fluorescence
time-lapse imaging of FOXO1-GFP in adult isolated living muscle fibers maintained
in culture to explore the effects of IGF1 and insulin on FOXO1-GFP nuclear efflux
with and without pharmacological inhibitors. We observed that although AKT
inhibitor blocks the IGF1- or insulin-induced effect on FOXO1 nuclear efflux,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, which we show to be effective in these 
fibers, do not. We also found that inhibition of the protein kinase ACK1 or ATM
contributes to the suppression of FOXO1 nuclear efflux after IGF1. These results 
indicate a novel pathway that has been unexplored in the IGF1- or insulin-induced
regulation of FOXO1 and present information useful both for therapeutic
interventions for muscle atrophy and for further investigative areas into insulin
insensitivity and type 2 diabetes.

Lysine acetylation of F-actin decreases tropomyosin-based inhibition of
actomyosin activity.

Recent proteomics studies of vertebrate striated muscle have identified lysine
acetylation at several sites on actin. Acetylation is a reversible
post-translational modification that neutralizes lysine's positive charge.
Positively charged residues on actin, particularly Lys326 and Lys328, are
predicted to form critical electrostatic interactions with tropomyosin (Tpm) that
promote its binding to filamentous (F)-actin and bias Tpm to an azimuthal
location where it impedes myosin attachment. The troponin (Tn) complex also
influences Tpm's position along F-actin as a function of Ca2+ to regulate
exposure of myosin-binding sites and, thus, myosin cross-bridge recruitment and
force production. Interestingly, Lys326 and Lys328 are among the documented
acetylated residues. Using an acetic anhydride-based labeling approach, we showed
that excessive, nonspecific actin acetylation did not disrupt characteristic
F-actin-Tpm binding. However, it significantly reduced Tpm-mediated inhibition of
myosin attachment, as reflected by increased F-actin-Tpm motility that persisted 
in the presence of Tn and submaximal Ca2+ Furthermore, decreasing the extent of
chemical acetylation, to presumptively target highly reactive Lys326 and Lys328, 
also resulted in less inhibited F-actin-Tpm, implying that modifying only these
residues influences Tpm's location and, potentially, thin filament regulation. To
unequivocally determine the residue-specific consequences of acetylation on
Tn-Tpm-based regulation of actomyosin activity, we assessed the effects of K326Q 
and K328Q acetyl (Ac)-mimetic actin on Ca2+-dependent, in vitro motility
parameters of reconstituted thin filaments (RTFs). Incorporation of K328Q actin
significantly enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of RTF activation relative to control.
Together, our findings suggest that actin acetylation, especially Lys328,
modulates muscle contraction via disrupting inhibitory Tpm positioning.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Pif1 helicase functions in both nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA replication and repair processes, preferentially unwinding
RNA:DNA hybrids and resolving G-quadruplex structures. We sought to determine how
the various activities of Pif1 are regulated in vivo Here, we report lysine
acetylation of nuclear Pif1 and demonstrate that it influences both Pif1's
cellular roles and core biochemical activities. Using Pif1 overexpression
toxicity assays, we determined that the acetyltransferase NuA4 and deacetylase
Rpd3 are primarily responsible for the dynamic acetylation of nuclear Pif1. MS
analysis revealed that Pif1 was modified in several domains throughout the
protein's sequence on the N terminus (Lys-118 and Lys-129), helicase domain
(Lys-525, Lys-639, and Lys-725), and C terminus (Lys-800). Acetylation of Pif1
exacerbated its overexpression toxicity phenotype, which was alleviated upon
deletion of its N terminus. Biochemical assays demonstrated that acetylation of
Pif1 stimulated its helicase, ATPase, and DNA-binding activities, whereas
maintaining its substrate preferences. Limited proteolysis assays indicate that
acetylation of Pif1 induces a conformational change that may account for its
altered enzymatic properties. We propose that acetylation is involved in
regulating of Pif1 activities, influencing a multitude of DNA transactions vital 
to the maintenance of genome integrity.

The RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 binds to and stabilizes a number of mRNA
sequences, including that of the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43
kDa (TDP-43). Ataxin-2 is additionally involved in several processes requiring
translation, such as germline formation, long-term habituation, and circadian
rhythm formation. However, it has yet to be unambiguously demonstrated that
Ataxin-2 is actually involved in activating the translation of its target mRNAs. 
Here we provide direct evidence from a polysome profile analysis showing that
Ataxin-2 enhances translation of target mRNAs. Our recently established method
for transcriptional pulse-chase analysis under conditions of suppressing
deadenylation revealed that Ataxin-2 promotes post-transcriptional
polyadenylation of the target mRNAs. Furthermore, Ataxin-2 binds to a
poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 and a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD4 via
its intrinsically disordered region (amino acids 906-1095) to recruit PAPD4 to
the targets. Post-transcriptional polyadenylation by Ataxin-2 explains not only
how it activates translation but also how it stabilizes target mRNAs, including
TDP-43 mRNA. Ataxin-2 is known to be a potent modifier of TDP-43 proteinopathies 
and to play a causative role in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar
ataxia type 2, so these findings suggest that Ataxin-2-induced cytoplasmic
polyadenylation and activation of translation might impact neurodegeneration
(i.e. TDP-43 proteinopathies), and this process could be a therapeutic target for
Ataxin-2-related neurodegenerative disorders.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in a variety of
biological activities of the cell. However, less is known about how lncRNAs
respond to environmental cues and what transcriptional mechanisms regulate their 
expression. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the lncRNA Tug1 (taurine 
upregulated gene 1) is crucial for the progression of diabetic kidney disease, a 
major microvascular complication of diabetes. Using a combination of proximity
labeling with the engineered soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2), ChIP-qPCR,
biotin-labeled oligonucleotide pulldown, and classical promoter luciferase assays
in kidney podocytes, we extend our initial observations in the current study and 
now provide a detailed analysis on a how high-glucose milieu downregulates Tug1
expression in podocytes. Our results revealed an essential role for the
transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) in
controlling Tug1 transcription in the podocytes in response to increased glucose 
levels. Along with ChREBP, other coregulators, including MAX dimerization protein
(MLX), MAX dimerization protein 1 (MXD1), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), were
enriched at the Tug1 promoter under high-glucose conditions. These observations
provide the first characterization of the mouse Tug1 promoter's response to the
high-glucose milieu. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism by which
ChREBP can coordinate glucose homeostasis with the expression of the lncRNA Tug1 
and further our understanding of dynamic transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs in
a disease state.

Ascorbic acid, a water-soluble antioxidant, regulates various biological
processes and is thought to influence cholesterol. However, little is known about
the mechanisms underpinning ascorbic acid-mediated cholesterol metabolism. Here, 
we determined if ascorbic acid can regulate expression of proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
leading to its intracellular degradation, to influence low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) metabolism. At cellular levels, ascorbic acid inhibited PCSK9 expression in
HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Consequently, LDLR expression and cellular LDL uptake 
were enhanced. Similar effects of ascorbic acid on PCSK9 and LDLR expression were
observed in mouse primary hepatocytes. Mechanistically, ascorbic acid suppressed 
PCSK9 expression in a forkhead box O3-dependent manner. In addition, ascorbic
acid increased LDLR transcription by regulating sterol regulatory element-binding
protein 2. In vivo, administration of ascorbic acid reduced serum PCSK9 levels
and enhanced liver LDLR expression in C57BL/6J mice. Reciprocally, lack of
ascorbic acid supplementation in L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase deficient (Gulo -/-) 
mice increased circulating PCSK9 and LDL levels, and decreased liver LDLR
expression, whereas ascorbic acid supplementation decreased PCSK9 and increased
LDLR expression, ameliorating LDL levels in Gulo -/- mice fed a high fat diet.
Moreover, ascorbic acid levels were negatively correlated to PCSK9, total and LDL
levels in human serum samples. Taken together, these findings suggest that
ascorbic acid reduces PCSK9 expression, leading to increased LDLR expression and 
cellular LDL uptake. Thus, supplementation of ascorbic acid may ameliorate lipid 
profiles in ascorbic acid-deficient species.

Podocyte injury is a critical step toward the progression of renal disease and is
often associated with a loss of slit diaphragm proteins, including Podocin.
Although there is a possibility that the extracellular domain of these slit
diaphragm proteins can be a target for a pathological proteolysis, the precise
mechanism driving the phenomenon remains unknown. Here we show that Matriptase, a
membrane-anchored protein, was activated at podocytes in CKD patients and mice,
whereas Matriptase inhibitors slowed the progression of mouse kidney disease. The
mechanism could be accounted for by an imbalance favoring Matriptase over its
cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1),
because conditional depletion of HAI-1 in podocytes accelerated podocyte injury
in mouse model. Matriptase was capable of cleaving Podocin, but such a reaction
was blocked by either HAI-1 or dominant-negative Matriptase. Furthermore, the N
terminus of Podocin, as a consequence of Matriptase cleavage of Podocin,
translocated to nucleoli, suggesting that the N terminus of Podocin might be
involved in the process of podocyte injury. Given these observations, we propose 
that the proteolytic cleavage of Podocin by Matriptase could potentially cause
podocyte injury and that targeting Matriptase could be a novel therapeutic
strategy for CKD patients.

Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by 
high prevalence of BRAF/NRAS mutations and hyperactivation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK), leading to uncontrolled melanoma growth. Efficacy of current targeted
therapies against mutant BRAF or MEK1/2 have been hindered by existence of innate
or development of acquired resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the
mechanisms controlled by MAPK pathway driving melanogenesis will help develop new
treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Here, we identify E3
ubiquitin ligase PARK2 as a direct target of ELK1, a known transcriptional
effector of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. We show that pharmacological
inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2 in melanoma cells increases PARK2 expression. 
PARK2 overexpression reduces melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo and
induces apoptosis. Conversely, its genetic silencing increases melanoma cell
proliferation and reduces cell death. Further, we demonstrate that ELK1 is
required by the BRAF-ERK1/2 pathway to repress PARK2 expression and promoter
activity in melanoma cells. Clinically, PARK2 is highly expressed in WT BRAF and 
NRAS melanomas, but it is expressed at low levels in melanomas carrying BRAF/NRAS
mutations. Overall, our data provide new insights into the tumor suppressive role
of PARK2 in malignant melanoma and uncover a novel mechanism for the negative
regulation of PARK2 via the ERK1/2-ELK1 axis. These findings suggest that
reactivation of PARK2 may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract
melanoma growth.

In macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy), cytoplasmic molecules and organelles are
randomly or selectively sequestered within double-membrane vesicles called
autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation. In
selective autophagy, the specificity of degradation targets is determined by
autophagy receptors. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy
receptors interact with specific targets and Atg11, resulting in the recruitment 
of a protein complex that initiates autophagosome formation. Previous studies
have revealed that autophagy receptors are regulated by posttranslational
modifications. In selective autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy), the receptor
Atg36 localizes to peroxisomes by binding to the peroxisomal membrane protein
Pex3. We previously reported that Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25 (casein kinase
1δ), increasing the Atg36-Atg11 interaction and thereby stimulating pexophagy
initiation. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Atg36 phosphorylation
are unknown. Here, we show that Atg36 phosphorylation is abolished in cells
lacking Pex3 or expressing a Pex3 mutant defective in the interaction with Atg36,
suggesting that the interaction with Pex3 is essential for the Hrr25-mediated
phosphorylation of Atg36. Using recombinant proteins, we further demonstrated
that Pex3 directly promotes Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25. A
co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the interaction of Atg36 with Hrr25
depends on Pex3. These results suggest that Pex3 increases the Atg36-Hrr25
interaction and thereby stimulates Atg36 phosphorylation on the peroxisomal
membrane. In addition, we found that Pex3 binding protects Atg36 from proteasomal
degradation. Thus, Pex3 confines Atg36 activity to the peroxisome by enhancing
its phosphorylation and stability on this organelle.

Hypoxia-inducible factors are heterodimeric transcription factors that play a
crucial role in a cell's ability to adapt to low oxygen. The von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor (pVHL) acts as a master regulator of HIF activity, and its
targeting of prolyl hydroxylated HIF-α for proteasomal degradation under normoxia
is thought to be a major mechanism for pVHL tumor suppression and cellular
response to oxygen. Whether pVHL regulates other targets through a similar
mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we identify TET2/3 as novel targets of pVHL. 
pVHL induces proteasomal degradation of TET2/3, resulting in reduced global
5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels. Conserved proline residues within the
LAP/LAP-like motifs of these two proteins are hydroxylated by the prolyl
hydroxylase enzymes (PHD2/EGLN1 and PHD3/EGLN3), which is prerequisite for
pVHL-mediated degradation. Using zebrafish as a model, we determined that global 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels are enhanced in vhl-null, egln1a/b-double-null,
and egln3-null embryos. Therefore, we reveal a novel function for the PHD-pVHL
pathway in regulating TET protein stability and activity. These data extend our
understanding of how TET proteins are regulated and provide new insight into the 
mechanisms of pVHL in tumor suppression.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition associated with diverse 
etiologies and abrupt loss of renal function. In patients with sepsis,
rhabdomyolysis, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders, the underlying disease or
associated therapeutic interventions can cause hypoxia, cytotoxicity, and
inflammatory insults to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), resulting in the 
onset of AKI. To uncover stress-responsive disease-modifying genes, here we have 
carried out renal transcriptome profiling in three distinct murine models of AKI.
We find that Vgf nerve growth factor inducible gene up-regulation is a common
transcriptional stress response in RTECs to ischemia-, cisplatin-, and
rhabdomyolysis-associated renal injury. The Vgf gene encodes a secretory peptide 
precursor protein that has critical neuroendocrine functions; however, its role
in the kidneys remains unknown. Our functional studies show that RTEC-specific
Vgf gene ablation exacerbates ischemia-, cisplatin-, and
rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI in vivo and cisplatin-induced RTEC cell death in
vitro Importantly, aggravation of cisplatin-induced renal injury caused by Vgf
gene ablation is partly reversed by TLQP-21, a Vgf-derived peptide. Finally, in
vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies showed that injury-induced Vgf
up-regulation in RTECs is driven by the transcriptional regulator Sox9. These
findings reveal a crucial downstream target of the Sox9-directed transcriptional 
program and identify Vgf as a stress-responsive protective gene in kidney tubular
epithelial cells.

The calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CaMKK2) is a key
regulator of cellular and whole-body energy metabolism. It is known to be
activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, but the mechanisms by which it is
inactivated are less clear. CaMKK2 inhibition protects against prostate cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and metabolic derangements induced by a high-fat diet; 
therefore, elucidating the intracellular mechanisms that inactivate CaMKK2 has
important therapeutic implications. Here we show that stimulation of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in cells inactivates CaMKK2 by
phosphorylation of three conserved serine residues. PKA-dependent phosphorylation
of Ser495 directly impairs calcium-calmodulin activation, whereas phosphorylation
of Ser100 and Ser511 mediate recruitment of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins that hold
CaMKK2 in the inactivated state by preventing dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser495
We also report the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ bound to a synthetic
diphosphorylated peptide that reveals how the canonical (Ser511) and noncanonical
(Ser100) 14-3-3 consensus sites on CaMKK2 cooperate to bind 14-3-3 proteins. Our

The glucagon receptor (GCGR) activated by the peptide hormone glucagon is a
seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates blood
glucose levels. Ubiquitination influences trafficking and signaling of many
GPCRs, but its characterization for the GCGR is lacking. Using endocytic
colocalization and ubiquitination assays, we have identified a correlation
between the ubiquitination profile and recycling of the GCGR. Our experiments
revealed that GCGRs are constitutively ubiquitinated at the cell surface.
Glucagon stimulation not only promoted GCGR endocytic trafficking through Rab5a
early endosomes and Rab4a recycling endosomes, but also induced rapid
deubiquitination of GCGRs. Inhibiting GCGR internalization or disrupting
endocytic trafficking prevented agonist-induced deubiquitination of the GCGR.
Furthermore, a Rab4a dominant negative (DN) that blocks trafficking at recycling 
endosomes enabled GCGR deubiquitination, whereas a Rab5a DN that blocks
trafficking at early endosomes eliminated agonist-induced GCGR deubiquitination. 
By down-regulating candidate deubiquitinases that are either linked with GPCR
trafficking or localized on endosomes, we identified signal-transducing adaptor
molecule-binding protein (STAMBP) and ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) as
cognate deubiquitinases for the GCGR. Our data suggest that USP33 constitutively 
deubiquitinates the GCGR, whereas both STAMBP and USP33 deubiquitinate
agonist-activated GCGRs at early endosomes. A mutant GCGR with all five
intracellular lysines altered to arginines remains deubiquitinated and shows
augmented trafficking to Rab4a recycling endosomes compared with the WT, thus
affirming the role of deubiquitination in GCGR recycling. We conclude that the
GCGRs are rapidly deubiquitinated after agonist-activation to facilitate
Rab4a-dependent recycling and that USP33 and STAMBP activities are critical for
the endocytic recycling of the GCGR.

Autophagy plays critical roles in the maintenance of endothelial cells in
response to cellular stress caused by blood flow. There is growing evidence that 
both cell adhesion and cell detachment can modulate autophagy, but the mechanisms
responsible for this regulation remain unclear. Immunoglobulin and proline-rich
receptor-1 (IGPR-1) is a cell adhesion molecule that regulates angiogenesis and
endothelial barrier function. In this study, using various biochemical and
cellular assays, we demonstrate that IGPR-1 is activated by autophagy-inducing
stimuli, such as amino acid starvation, nutrient deprivation, rapamycin, and
lipopolysaccharide. Manipulating the IκB kinase β activity coupled with in vivo
and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that IκB kinase β is a key
serine/threonine kinase activated by autophagy stimuli and that it catalyzes
phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser220 The subsequent activation of IGPR-1, in turn,
stimulates phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which leads to
phosphorylation of the major pro-autophagy proteins ULK1 and Beclin-1 (BECN1),
increased LC3-II levels, and accumulation of LC3 punctum. Thus, our data
demonstrate that IGPR-1 is activated by autophagy-inducing stimuli and in
response regulates autophagy, connecting cell adhesion to autophagy. These
findings may have important significance for autophagy-driven pathologies such
cardiovascular diseases and cancer and suggest that IGPR-1 may serve as a
promising therapeutic target.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the major pathways that regulates embryonic
development, adult homeostasis, and stem cell self-renewal. In this pathway,
transcription factors T-cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) serve 
as a key switch to repress or activate Wnt target gene transcription by
recruiting repressor molecules or interacting with the β-catenin effector,
respectively. It has become evident that the protein stability of the TCF/LEF
family members may play a critical role in controlling the activity of the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, factors that regulate the stability of 
TCF/LEFs remain largely unknown. Here, we report that pVHL binding protein 1
(VBP1) regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by controlling the stability
of TCF/LEFs. Surprisingly, we found that either overexpression or knockdown of
VBP1 decreased Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in both cultured cells and
zebrafish embryos. Mechanistically, VBP1 directly binds to all four TCF/LEF
family members and von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL). Either
overexpression or knockdown of VBP1 increases the association between TCF/LEFs
and pVHL and then decreases the protein levels of TCF/LEFs via proteasomal
degradation. Together, our results provide mechanistic insights into the roles of
VBP1 in controlling TCF/LEFs protein stability and regulating Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway activity.

Adult progenitor cell populations typically exist in a quiescent state within a
controlled niche environment. However, various stresses or forms of damage can
disrupt this state, which often leads to dysfunction and aging. We built a
glucocorticoid (GC)-induced liver damage model of mice, found that GC stress
induced liver damage, leading to consequences for progenitor cells expansion.
However, the mechanisms by which niche factors cause progenitor cells
proliferation are largely unknown. We demonstrate that, within the liver
progenitor cells niche, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is responsible for driving a subset of
progenitor cells to break quiescence. We show that GC stress causes aging of the 
niche, which induces the up-regulation of Gal-3. The increased Gal-3 population
increasingly interacts with the progenitor cell marker CD133, which triggers
focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling. This results
in the loss of quiescence and leads to the eventual stemness exhaustion of
progenitor cells. Conversely, blocking Gal-3 with the inhibitor TD139 prevents
the loss of stemness and improves liver function. These experiments identify a
stress-dependent change in progenitor cell niche that directly influence liver
progenitor cell quiescence and function.

Phospholipase Cε (PLCε) is activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors
and receptor tyrosine kinases through direct interactions with small GTPases,
including Rap1A and Ras. Although Ras has been reported to allosterically
activate the lipase, it is not known whether Rap1A has the same ability or what
its molecular mechanism might be. Rap1A activates PLCε in response to the
stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors, translocating the complex to the
perinuclear membrane. Because the C-terminal Ras association (RA2) domain of PLCε
was proposed to the primary binding site for Rap1A, we first confirmed using
purified proteins that the RA2 domain is indeed essential for activation by
Rap1A. However, we also showed that the PLCε pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and 
first two EF hands (EF1/2) are required for Rap1A activation and identified
hydrophobic residues on the surface of the RA2 domain that are also necessary.
Small-angle X-ray scattering showed that Rap1A binding induces and stabilizes
discrete conformational states in PLCε variants that can be activated by the
GTPase. These data, together with the recent structure of a catalytically active 
fragment of PLCε, provide the first evidence that Rap1A, and by extension Ras,
allosterically activate the lipase by promoting and stabilizing interactions
between the RA2 domain and the PLCε core.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate signaling cascades via G-proteins
and beta-arrestins (βarr). βarr-dependent actions begin with recruitment of βarr 
to the phosphorylated receptor tail and are followed by engagement with the
receptor core. βarrs are known to act as adaptor proteins binding receptors and
various effectors, but it is unclear whether in addition to the scaffolding role 
βarrs can allosterically activate their downstream targets. Here we demonstrate
the direct allosteric activation of proto-oncogene kinase Src by GPCR-βarr
complexes in vitro and establish the conformational basis of the activation.
Whereas free βarr1 had no effect on Src activity, βarr1 in complex with M2
muscarinic or β2-adrenergic receptors reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs activate
Src by reducing the lag phase in Src autophosphorylation. Interestingly,
receptor-βarr1 complexes formed with a βarr1 mutant, in which the finger-loop,
required to interact with the receptor core, has been deleted, fully retain the
ability to activate Src. Similarly, βarr1 in complex with only a phosphorylated
C-terminal tail of the vasopressin 2 receptor activates Src as efficiently as
GPCR-βarr complexes. In contrast, βarr1 and chimeric M2 receptor with
nonphosphorylated C-terminal tail failed to activate Src. Taken together, these
data demonstrate that the phosphorylated GPCR tail interaction with βarr1 is
necessary and sufficient to empower it to allosterically activate Src. Our
findings may have implications for understanding more broadly the mechanisms of
allosteric activation of downstream targets by βarrs.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a multimodal receptor
that is responsible for nociceptive, thermal, and mechanical sensations. However,
which biomolecular partners specifically interact with TRPV1 remains to be
elucidated. Here, we used cDNA library screening of genes from mouse dorsal root 
ganglia combined with patch-clamp electrophysiology to identify the voltage-gated
potassium channel auxiliary subunit Kvβ1 physically interacting with TRPV1
channel and regulating its function. The interaction was validated in situ using 
endogenous dorsal root ganglia neurons, as well as a recombinant expression model
in HEK 293T cells. The presence of Kvβ1 enhanced the expression stability of
TRPV1 channels on the plasma membrane and the nociceptive current density.
Surprisingly, Kvβ1 interaction also shifted the temperature threshold for TRPV1
thermal activation. Using site-specific mapping, we further revealed that Kvβ1
interacted with the membrane-distal domain and membrane-proximal domain of TRPV1 
to regulate its membrane expression and temperature-activation threshold,
respectively. Our data therefore suggest that Kvβ1 is a key element in the TRPV1 
signaling complex and exerts dual regulatory effects in a site-specific manner.

We have observed overexpression of PACS-1, a cytosolic sorting protein in primary
cervical tumors. Absence of exonic mutations and overexpression at the RNA level 
suggested a transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional regulation. University of 
California Santa Cruz genome browser analysis of PACS-1 micro RNAs (miR),
revealed two 8-base target sequences at the 3' terminus for hsa-miR-34a and
hsa-miR-449a. Quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting studies showed reduced or
loss of expression of the two microRNAs in cervical cancer cell lines and primary
tumors, indicating dysregulation of these two microRNAs in cervical cancer. Loss 
of PACS-1 with siRNA or exogenous expression of hsa-miR-34a or hsa-miR-449a in
HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines resulted in DNA damage response, S-phase
cell cycle arrest, and reduction in cell growth. Furthermore, the siRNA studies
showed that loss of PACS-1 expression was accompanied by increased nuclear γH2AX 
expression, Lys382-p53 acetylation, and genomic instability. PACS-1 re-expression
through LNA-hsa-anti-miR-34a or -449a or through PACS-1 cDNA transfection led to 
the reversal of DNA damage response and restoration of cell growth. Release of
cells post 24-h serum starvation showed PACS-1 nuclear localization at G1-S phase
of the cell cycle. Our results therefore indicate that the loss of hsa-miR-34a
and hsa-miR-449a expression in cervical cancer leads to overexpression of PACS-1 
and suppression of DNA damage response, resulting in the development of
chemo-resistant tumors.

Heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) and -1 (HO1) catalyze heme degradation to biliverdin, CO, 
and iron, forming an essential link in the heme metabolism network. Tight
regulation of the cellular levels and catalytic activities of HO1 and HO2 is
important for maintaining heme homeostasis. HO1 expression is transcriptionally
regulated; however, HO2 expression is constitutive. How the cellular levels and
activity of HO2 are regulated remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the mechanism
of post-translational regulation of cellular HO2 levels by heme. We find that,
under heme-deficient conditions, HO2 is destabilized and targeted for
degradation, suggesting that heme plays a direct role in HO2 regulation. HO2 has 
three heme binding sites: one at its catalytic site and the others at its two
heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). We report that, in contrast to other
HRM-containing proteins, the cellular protein level and degradation rate of HO2
are independent of heme binding to the HRMs. Rather, under heme deficiency, loss 
of heme binding to the catalytic site destabilizes HO2. Consistently, an HO2
catalytic site variant that is unable to bind heme exhibits a constant low
protein level and an enhanced protein degradation rate compared with the WT HO2. 
Finally, HO2 is degraded by the lysosome through chaperone-mediated autophagy,
distinct from other HRM-containing proteins and HO1, which are degraded by the
proteasome. These results reveal a novel aspect of HO2 regulation and deepen our 
understanding of HO2's role in maintaining heme homeostasis, paving the way for
future investigation into HO2's pathophysiological role in heme deficiency
response.

The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin increases trafficking of KATP and Kv2.1
channels to the pancreatic β-cell surface, resulting in membrane
hyperpolarization and suppression of insulin secretion. We have previously shown 
that this effect of leptin is mediated by the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors
(NMDARs). It does so by potentiating NMDAR activity, thus enhancing Ca2+ influx
and the ensuing downstream signaling events that drive channel trafficking to the
cell surface. However, the molecular mechanism by which leptin potentiates NMDARs
in β-cells remains unknown. Here, we report that leptin augments NMDAR function
via Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the GluN2A subunit. Leptin-induced
membrane hyperpolarization diminished upon pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A
but not GluN2B, indicating involvement of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. GluN2A
harbors tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated by Src family kinases,
potentiate NMDAR activity. We found that leptin increases phosphorylation of
Tyr-418 in Src, an indicator of kinase activation. Pharmacological inhibition of 
Src or overexpression of a kinase-dead Src mutant prevented the effect of leptin,
whereas a Src kinase activator peptide mimicked it. Using mutant GluN2A
overexpression, we show that Tyr-1292 and Tyr-1387 but not Tyr-1325 are
responsible for the effect of leptin. Importantly, β-cells from db/db mice, a
type 2 diabetes mouse model lacking functional leptin receptors, or from obese
diabetic human donors failed to respond to leptin but hyperpolarized in response 
to NMDA. Our study reveals a signaling pathway wherein leptin modulates NMDARs
via Src to regulate β-cell excitability and suggests NMDARs as a potential target
to overcome leptin resistance.

Thoracic great vessels such as the aorta and subclavian arteries are formed
through dynamic remodeling of embryonic pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs). Previous
work has shown that loss of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hey1 in
mice causes abnormal fourth PAA development and lethal great vessel anomalies
resembling congenital malformations in humans. However, how Hey1 mediates
vascular formation remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that Hey1 in
vascular endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells, played essential
roles for PAA development and great vessel morphogenesis in mouse embryos.
Tek-Cre-mediated Hey1 deletion in endothelial cells affected endothelial tube
formation and smooth muscle differentiation in embryonic fourth PAAs and resulted
in interruption of the aortic arch and other great vessel malformations. Cell
specificity and signal responsiveness of Hey1 expression were controlled through 
multiple cis-regulatory regions. We found two distal genomic regions that had
enhancer activity in endothelial cells and in the pharyngeal epithelium and
somites, respectively. The novel endothelial enhancer was conserved across
species and was specific to large-caliber arteries. Its transcriptional activity 
was regulated by Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo, but not by ALK1 signaling 
and other transcription factors implicated in endothelial cell specificity. The
distal endothelial enhancer was not essential for basal Hey1 expression in mouse 
embryos but may likely serve for Notch-dependent transcriptional control in
endothelial cells together with the proximal regulatory region. These findings
help in understanding the significance and regulation of endothelial Hey1 as a
mediator of multiple signaling pathways in embryonic vascular formation.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a tissue-specific transcription factor
that is required for normal kidney development and renal epithelial
differentiation. Mutations of HNF-1β produce congenital kidney abnormalities and 
inherited renal tubulopathies. Here, we show that ablation of HNF-1β in mIMCD3
renal epithelial cells results in activation of β-catenin and increased
expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), a downstream effector in
the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Increased expression and nuclear
localization of LEF1 are also observed in cystic kidneys from Hnf1b mutant mice. 
Expression of dominant-negative mutant HNF-1β in mIMCD3 cells produces
hyperresponsiveness to exogenous Wnt ligands, which is inhibited by
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Lef1. WT HNF-1β binds to two evolutionarily conserved
sites located 94 and 30 kb from the mouse Lef1 promoter. Ablation of HNF-1β
decreases H3K27 trimethylation repressive marks and increases β-catenin occupancy
at a site 4 kb upstream to Lef1. Mechanistically, WT HNF-1β recruits the
polycomb-repressive complex 2 that catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation. Deletion of
the β-catenin-binding domain of LEF1 in HNF-1β-deficient cells abolishes the
increase in Lef1 transcription and decreases the expression of downstream Wnt
target genes. The canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, is also a direct
transcriptional target of HNF-1β through binding to negative regulatory elements 
in the gene promoter. These findings demonstrate that HNF-1β regulates canonical 
Wnt target genes through long-range effects on histone methylation at Wnt
enhancers and reveal a new mode of active transcriptional repression by HNF-1β.

RAS genes are the most commonly mutated in human cancers and play critical roles 
in tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Identification of targets 
that block RAS signaling is pivotal to develop therapies for RAS-related cancer. 
As RAS translocation to the plasma membrane (PM) is essential for its effective
signal transduction, we devised a high-content screening assay to search for
genes regulating KRAS membrane association. We found that the tyrosine
phosphatase PTPN2 regulates the plasma membrane localization of KRAS. Knockdown
of PTPN2 reduced the proliferation and promoted apoptosis in KRAS-dependent
cancer cells, but not in KRAS-independent cells. Mechanistically, PTPN2
negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of KRAS, which, in turn, affects
the activation KRAS and its downstream signaling. Consistently, analysis of the
TCGA database demonstrates that high expression of PTPN2 is significantly
associated with poor prognosis of patients with KRAS-mutant pancreatic
adenocarcinoma. These results indicate that PTPN2 is a key regulator of KRAS and 
may serve as a new target for therapy of KRAS-driven cancer.

Acute lung injury (ALI), is a rapidly progressing heterogenous pulmonary disorder
that possesses a high risk of mortality. Accumulating evidence has implicated the
activation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB [NF-κB(p65)] activation in the
pathological process of ALI. microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small RNA molecules, 
have emerged as major governors due to their post-transcriptional regulation of
gene expression in a wide array of pathological processes, including ALI. The
dysregulation of miRNAs and NF-κB activation has been implicated in human
diseases. In the current study, we set out to decipher the convergence of miR-99b
and p65 NF-κB activation in ALI pathology. We measured the release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid using ELISA. MH-S cells were cultured and their viability were detected
with cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) assays. The results showed that miR-99b was
up-regulated, while PRDM1 was down-regulated in a lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced murine model of ALI. Mechanistic investigations showed that
NF-κB(p65) was enriched at the miR-99b promoter region, and further promoted its 
transcriptional activity. Furthermore, miR-99b targeted PRDM1 by binding to its
3'UTR, causing its down-regulation. This in-creased lung injury, as evidenced by 
increased wet/dry ratio of mouse lung, myeloperoxidase activity and
pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhanced infiltration of inflammatory
cells in lung tissues. Together, our findings indicate that NF-κB(p65) promotion 
of miR-99b can aggravate ALI in mice by down-regulating the expression of PRDM1.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged 
to a pandemic and caused global public health crisis. Human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for
SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates
besides angiotensin II to control vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Given
the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we
investigated how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2.
Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic
activity ∼3-10 fold against model peptide substrates, such as caspase-1 substrate
and Bradykinin-analog. The enhancement in ACE2 enzymatic function was mediated by
the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain. These results highlighted the
potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection to enhance ACE2 activity, which may be
relevant to the cardiovascular symptoms associated with COVID-19.

Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential constituent of the bacterial cell wall. During
cell division, the machinery responsible for PG synthesis localizes mid-cell, at 
the septum, under the control of a multiprotein complex called the divisome. In
Escherichia coli, septal PG synthesis and cell constriction rely on the
accumulation of FtsN at the division site. Interestingly, a short sequence of
FtsN (Leu75-Gln93, known as EFtsN) was shown to be essential and sufficient for
its functioning in vivo, but what exactly this sequence is doing remained
unknown. Here, we show that EFtsN binds specifically to the major PG synthase
PBP1b and is sufficient to stimulate its biosynthetic glycosyltransferase (GTase)
activity. We also report the crystal structure of PBP1b in complex with EFtsN,
which demonstrates that EFtsN binds at the junction between the GTase and UB2H
domains of PBP1b. Interestingly, mutations to two residues (R141A/R397A) within
the EFtsN-binding pocket reduced the activation of PBP1b by FtsN but not by the
lipoprotein LpoB. This mutant was unable to rescue the ΔponB-ponA ts strain,
which lacks PBP1b and has a thermosensitive PBP1a, at nonpermissive temperature
and induced a mild cell-chaining phenotype and cell lysis. Altogether, the
results show that EFtsN interacts with PBP1b and that this interaction plays a
role in the activation of its GTase activity by FtsN, which may contribute to the
overall septal PG synthesis and regulation during cell division.

The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (FXN) expression in Friedreich's
ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the FXN locus caused by
the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone
methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the
regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a
human FXN-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we 
screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found
that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool
compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by ∼1.5-fold in the reporter cell 
line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not 
seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2
and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation
in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity
relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs
were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing
FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is
important in the regulation of FXN expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a
potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss and accumulation of
β-amyloid-protein (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma. Sleep impairment is associated
with AD and affects about 25-40% of patients in the mild-to-moderate stages of
the disease. Sleep deprivation leads to increased Aβ production; however, its
mechanism remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the increase in core body
temperature induced by sleep deprivation may promote Aβ production. Here, we
report temperature-dependent regulation of Aβ production. We found that an
increase in temperature, from 37 °C to 39 °C, significantly increased Aβ
production in amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing cells. We also found that 
high temperature (39 °C) significantly increased the expression levels of heat
shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the C-terminal fragment of presenilin 1 (PS1-CTF)
and promoted γ-secretase complex formation. Interestingly, Hsp90 was associated
with the components of the premature γ-secretase complex, anterior
pharynx-defective-1 (APH-1), and nicastrin (NCT) but was not associated with
PS1-CTF or presenilin enhancer-2. Hsp90 knockdown abolished the increased level
of Aβ production and the increased formation of the γ-secretase complex at high
temperature in culture. Furthermore, with in vivo experiments, we observed
increases in the levels of Hsp90, PS1-CTF, NCT, and the γ-secretase complex in
the cortex of mice housed at higher room temperature (30 °C) compared with those 
housed at standard room temperature (23 °C). Our results suggest that high
temperature regulates Aβ production by modulating γ-secretase complex formation
through the binding of Hsp90 to NCT/APH-1.

Evolving evidence suggests that nicotine may contribute to impaired asthma
control by stimulating expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin
associated with airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness. We explored the
hypothesis that nicotine increases NGF by reducing lung fibroblast (LF)
microRNA-98 (miR-98) and PPARγ levels, thus promoting airway remodeling. Levels
of NGF, miR-98, PPARγ, fibronectin 1 (FN1), endothelin-1 (EDN1, herein referred
to as ET-1), and collagen (COL1A1 and COL3A1) were measured in human LFs isolated
from smoking donors, in mouse primary LFs exposed to nicotine (50 μg/ml), and in 
whole lung homogenates from mice chronically exposed to nicotine (100 μg/ml) in
the drinking water. In selected studies, these pathways were manipulated in LFs
with miR-98 inhibitor (anti-miR-98), miR-98 overexpression (miR-98 mimic), or the
PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. Compared with unexposed controls, nicotine increased
NGF, FN1, ET-1, COL1A1, and COL3A1 expression in human and mouse LFs and mouse
lung homogenates. In contrast, nicotine reduced miR-98 levels in LFs in vitro and
in lung homogenates in vivo Treatment with anti-miR-98 alone was sufficient to
recapitulate increases in NGF, FN1, and ET-1, whereas treatment with a miR-98
mimic significantly suppressed luciferase expression in cells transfected with a 
luciferase reporter linked to the putative seed sequence in the NGF 3'UTR and
also abrogated nicotine-induced increases in NGF, FN1, and ET-1 in LFs.
Similarly, rosiglitazone increased miR-98 and reversed nicotine-induced increases
in NGF, FN1, and ET-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that
nicotine-induced increases in NGF and other markers of airway remodeling are
negatively regulated by miR-98.

Timely repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential to maintaining
genomic integrity and preventing illnesses induced by genetic abnormalities. We
previously demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 plays a critical
tumor suppressing role via its interaction with RNF20 (ring finger protein 20) in
shaping chromatin landscape and preserving genomic stability. However, the
mechanism that mobilizes SMURF2 in response to DNA damage remains unclear. Using 
biochemical approaches and MS analysis, we show that upon the onset of the
DNA-damage response, SMURF2 becomes phosphorylated at Ser384 by ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase, and this phosphorylation is
required for its interaction with RNF20. We demonstrate that a SMURF2 mutant with
an S384A substitution has reduced capacity to ubiquitinate RNF20 while promoting 
Smad3 ubiquitination unabatedly. More importantly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts
expressing the SMURF2 S384A mutant show a weakened ability to sustain the DSB
response compared with those expressing WT SMURF2 following etoposide treatment. 
These data indicate that SMURF2-mediated RNF20 ubiquitination and degradation
controlled by ataxia telangiectasia mutated-induced phosphorylation at Ser384
constitutes a negative feedback loop that regulates DSB repair.

Methionine, through S-adenosylmethionine, activates a multifaceted growth program
in which ribosome biogenesis, carbon metabolism, and amino acid and nucleotide
biosynthesis are induced. This growth program requires the activity of the Gcn4
transcription factor (called ATF4 in mammals), which facilitates the supply of
metabolic precursors that are essential for anabolism. However, how Gcn4 itself
is regulated in the presence of methionine is unknown. Here, we discover that
Gcn4 protein levels are increased by methionine, despite conditions of high cell 
growth and translation (in which the roles of Gcn4 are not well-studied). We
demonstrate that this mechanism of Gcn4 induction is independent of
transcription, as well as the conventional Gcn2/eIF2α-mediated increased
translation of Gcn4. Instead, when methionine is abundant, Gcn4 phosphorylation
is decreased, which reduces its ubiquitination and therefore degradation. Gcn4 is
dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); our data show that when
methionine is abundant, the conserved methyltransferase Ppm1 methylates and
alters the activity of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, shifting the balance of
Gcn4 toward a dephosphorylated, stable state. The absence of Ppm1 or the loss of 
the PP2A methylation destabilizes Gcn4 even when methionine is abundant, leading 
to collapse of the Gcn4-dependent anabolic program. These findings reveal a
novel, methionine-dependent signaling and regulatory axis. Here methionine
directs the conserved methyltransferase Ppm1 via its target phosphatase PP2A to
selectively stabilize Gcn4. Through this, cells conditionally modify a major
phosphatase to stabilize a metabolic master regulator and drive anabolism.

GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family shown to play
important roles in cell adhesion, brain development, immune function, and
tumorigenesis. GPR56 is highly upregulated in colorectal cancer and correlates
with poor prognosis. Several studies have shown GPR56 couples to the Gα12/13
class of heterotrimeric G-proteins to promote RhoA activation. However, due to
its structural complexity and lack of a high-affinity receptor-specific ligand,
the complete GPR56 signaling mechanism remains largely unknown. To delineate the 
activation mechanism and intracellular signaling functions of GPR56, we generated
a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity and specificity to the 
extracellular domain (ECD). Using deletion mutants, we mapped the mAb binding
site to the GAIN domain, which mediates membrane-proximal autoproteolytic
cleavage of the ECD. We showed that GPR56 overexpression in 293T cells leads to
increased phosphorylation of Src, Fak, and paxillin adhesion proteins and
activation of the Gα12/13-RhoA-mediated serum response factor (SRF) pathway.
Treatment with the mAb potentiated Src-Fak phosphorylation, RhoA-SRF signaling,
and cell adhesion. Consistently, GPR56 knockdown in colorectal cancer cells
decreased Src-Fak pathway phosphorylation and cell adhesion. Interestingly,
GPR56-mediated activation of Src-Fak phosphorylation occurred independent of
RhoA, yet mAb-induced potentiation of RhoA-SRF signaling was Src-dependent.
Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal portion of the
Serine-Threonine-Proline-rich (STP) region, adjacent to the GAIN domain, was
required for Src-Fak activation. However, autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD was
dispensable. These data support a new ECD-dependent mechanism by which GPR56
functions to regulate adhesion through activation of Src-Fak signaling.

Down syndrome (DS) is mainly caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy
21), and patients display a variety of developmental symptoms, including
characteristic facial features, physical growth delay, intellectual disability,
and neurodegeneration (i.e., Alzheimer's disease; AD). One of the pathological
hallmarks of AD is insoluble deposits of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that
consist of hyperphosphorylated tau. The human DYRK1A gene is mapped to chromosome
21, and the protein is associated with the formation of inclusion bodies in AD.
For example, DYRK1A directly phosphorylates multiple serine and threonine
residues of tau, including Thr212. However, the mechanism underpinning DYRK1A
involvement in Trisomy 21-related pathological tau aggregation remains unknown.
Here, we explored a novel regulatory mechanism of DYRK1A and subsequent tau
pathology through a phosphatase. Using LC-MS/MS technology, we analyzed multiple 
DYRK1A-binding proteins, including PPM1B, a member of the PP2C family of Ser/Thr 
protein phosphatases, in HEK293 cells. We found that PPM1B dephosphorylates
DYRK1A at Ser258, contributing to the inhibition of DYRK1A activity. Moreover,
PPM1B-mediated dephosphorylation of DYRK1A reduced tau phosphorylation at Thr212,
leading to inhibition of toxic tau oligomerization and aggregation. In
conclusion, our study demonstrates that DYRK1A autophosphorylates Ser258, the
dephosphorylation target of PPM1B, and PPM1B negatively regulates DYRK1A
activity. This finding also suggests that PPM1B reduces the toxic formation of
phospho-tau protein via DYRK1A modulation, possibly providing a novel cellular
protective mechanism to regulate toxic tau-mediated neuropathology in AD of DS.

Autophagy is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis through removing impaired
organelles. It has recently been found to play pivotal roles in diabetes mellitus
(DM), which is associated with increased bone fracture risk and loss of bone
density. However, the mechanism whereby autophagy modulates DM-induced bone loss 
is not fully elucidated. Previous work has shown that 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25D) exerts positive effects on autophagy, thus affecting bone metabolism.
Here, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in the regulation of
diabetic bone metabolism. Using Micro-CT, Elisa, histology, and histomorphometry 
analysis, we demonstrated that 1,25D rescues glucose metabolism dysfunction and
ameliorates bone loss in diabetic mice. In vitro, 1,25D alleviated primary
osteoblast dysfunction and intracellular oxidative stress through reducing
prolonged high-glucose-mediated excessive autophagy in primary osteoblasts,
reflected by decreased protein level of Beclin1 and LC3. Of note, the autophagy
activator rapamycin (RAP) ablated the positive effects of 1,25D in diabetic
environment, leading to a marked increase in autolysosomes and autophagosomes,
examined by mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence double labeling. The excessive autophagy
induced by high glucose was deleterious to proliferation and differentiation of
primary osteoblasts. Additionally, biochemical studies identified that PI3K/Akt
signaling could be activated by 1,25D, resulting in the inhibition of FoxO1. We
confirmed that FoxO1 deficiency alleviated high-glucose-induced autophagy and
improved biological functions of primary osteoblasts. Together, our results
suggest that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway is involved in the
osteoprotective effect of 1,25D by attenuating autophagy in diabetes, providing a
novel insight for the prevention and treatment of diabetes-caused bone loss.

Androglobin (ADGB) represents the latest addition to the globin superfamily in
metazoans. The chimeric protein comprises a calpain domain and a unique
circularly permutated globin domain. ADGB expression levels are most abundant in 
mammalian testis, but its cell-type-specific expression, regulation, and function
have remained unexplored. Analyzing bulk and single-cell mRNA-Seq data from
mammalian tissues, we found that-in addition to the testes-ADGB is prominently
expressed in the female reproductive tract, lungs, and brain, specifically being 
associated with cell types forming motile cilia. Correlation analysis suggested
coregulation of ADGB with FOXJ1, a crucial transcription factor of ciliogenesis. 
Investigating the transcriptional regulation of the ADGB gene, we characterized
its promoter using epigenomic datasets, exogenous promoter-dependent luciferase
assays, and CRISPR/dCas9-VPR-mediated activation approaches. Reporter gene assays
revealed that FOXJ1 indeed substantially enhanced luciferase activity driven by
the ADGB promoter. ChIP assays confirmed binding of FOXJ1 to the endogenous ADGB 
promoter region. We dissected the minimal sequence required for FOXJ1-dependent
regulation and fine mapped the FOXJ1 binding site to two evolutionarily conserved
regions within the ADGB promoter. FOXJ1 overexpression significantly increased
endogenous ADGB mRNA levels in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. Similar results were
observed upon RFX2 overexpression, another key transcription factor in
ciliogenesis. The complex transcriptional regulation of the ADGB locus was
illustrated by identifying a distal enhancer, responsible for synergistic
regulation by RFX2 and FOXJ1. Finally, cell culture studies indicated an
ADGB-dependent increase in the number of ciliated cells upon overexpression of
the full-length protein, confirming a ciliogenesis-associated role of ADGB in
mammals.

Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-stress-regulated protein exhibiting cytoprotective properties
through a poorly understood mechanism in various in vitro and in vivo models of
neuronal and non-neuronal damage. Although initially characterized as a secreted 
neurotrophic factor for midbrain dopamine neurons, MANF has recently gained more 
interest for its intracellular role in regulating the ER homeostasis, including
serving as a cofactor of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). We
aimed for a better understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of MANF. Here 
we show for the first time that MANF promotes the survival of ER-stressed neurons
in vitro as a general unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator, affecting
several UPR pathways simultaneously. Interestingly, MANF does not affect naïve
neurons. We hypothesize that MANF regulates UPR signaling toward a mode more
compatible with neuronal survival. Screening of MANF interacting proteins from
two mammalian cell lines revealed a conserved interactome of 15 proteins
including several ER chaperones such as GRP78, GRP170, protein disulfide
isomerase family A member 1, and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 6.
Further characterization confirmed previously published finding that MANF is a
cofactor of GRP78 interacting with its nucleotide binding domain. Using
microscale thermophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we
discovered that MANF is an ATP binding protein and that ATP blocks the MANF-GRP78
interaction. Interestingly, functional analysis of the antiapoptotic properties
of MANF mutants in cultured neurons revealed divergent roles of MANF as a GRP78
cofactor and as an antiapoptotic regulator of UPR. We conclude that the co-factor
type interaction with GRP78 is dispensable for the survival-promoting activity of
MANF in neurons.

Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver necrosis is a form of regulated cell death
(RCD) in which APAP activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and
specifically the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, leading to necrotic cell 
death. Previously, we have shown that receptor interacting protein kinase-1
(RIPK1) knockdown is also protective against APAP RCD upstream of JNK. However,
whether the kinase or platform function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP RCD is not
known. To answer this question, we used genetic mouse models of targeted
hepatocyte RIPK1 knockout (RIPK1HepCKO) or kinase dead knock-in (RIPK1D138N) and 
adult hepatocyte specific knockout of the cytoprotective protein A20 (A20HepCKO),
known to interact with RIPK1, to study its potential involvement in MAPK
signaling. We observed no difference in injury between WT and RIPK1D138N mice
post APAP. However, RIPK1HepCKO was protective. We found that RIPK1HepCKO mice
had attenuated pJNK activation, while A20 was simultaneously upregulated.
Conversely, A20HepCKO markedly worsened liver injury from APAP. Mechanistically, 
we observed a significant upregulation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
(ASK1) and increased JNK activation in A20HepCKO mice compared with littermate
controls. We also demonstrated that A20 coimmunoprecipitated (co-IP) with both
RIPK1 and ASK1, and that in the presence of RIPK1, there was less A20-ASK1
association than in its absence. We conclude that the kinase-independent platform
function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP toxicity. Adult RIPK1HepCKO mice are
protected against APAP by upregulating A20 and attenuating JNK signaling through 
ASK1, conversely, A20HepCKO worsens injury from APAP.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains various enzymes that metabolize fatty
acids (FAs). Given that FAs are the components of membranes, FA metabolic enzymes
might be associated with regulation of ER membrane functions. However, it remains
unclear whether there is the interplay between FA metabolic enzymes and ER
membrane proteins. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (TER) is an FA reductase present
in the ER membrane and catalyzes the last step in the FA elongation cycle and
sphingosine degradation pathway. Here we identify sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum
Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b), an ER Ca2+ pump responsible for Ca2+ accumulation in
the ER, as a TER-binding protein by affinity purification from HEK293 cell
lysates. We show that TER directly binds to SERCA2b by in vitro assays using
recombinant proteins. Thapsigargin, a specific SERCA inhibitor, inhibits this
binding. TER binds to SERCA2b through its conserved C-terminal region. TER
overexpression suppresses SERCA2b ATPase activity in microsomal membranes of
HEK293 cells. Depletion of TER increases Ca2+ storage in the ER and accelerates
SERCA2b-dependent Ca2+ uptake to the ER after ligand-induced Ca2+ release.
Moreover, depletion of TER reduces the Ca2+-dependent nuclear translocation of
nuclear factor of activated T cells 4. These results demonstrate that TER is a
negative regulator of SERCA2b, implying the direct linkage of FA metabolism and
Ca2+ accumulation in the ER.

Ras genes are among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human malignancies. 
To date, there are no successful anticancer drugs in the clinic that target Ras
proteins or their pathways. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and
characterize new components that regulate Ras activity or mediate its downstream 
signaling. To this end, we used a combination of affinity-pulldown and mass
spectrometry to search for proteins that are physically associated with KRas. One
of the top hits was Radil, a gene product with a Ras-association domain. Radil is
known to be a downstream effector of Rap1, inhibiting RhoA signaling to regulate 
cell adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that Radil interacted with all three 
isoforms of Ras including HRas, NRas, and KRas, although it exhibited the
strongest interaction with KRas. Moreover, Radil interacts with GTP-bound Ras
more efficiently, suggesting a possibility that Radil may be involved in Ras
activation. Supporting this, ectopic expression of Radil led to transient
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase; Radil knockdown resulted in weakened activation of Ras
downstream signaling components, which was coupled with decreased cell
proliferation and invasion, and reduced expression of mesenchymal cell markers.
Moreover, Radil knockdown greatly reduced the number of adhesion foci and
depolymerized actin filaments, molecular processes that facilitate cancer cell
migration. Taken together, our present studies strongly suggest that Radil is an 
important player for regulating Ras signaling, cell adhesion, and the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and may provide new directions for Ras-related 
anticancer drug development.

Upregulation of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NTS) in a subgroup of lung cancers 
has been linked to poor prognosis. However, the regulatory pathway centered on
NTS in lung cancer remains unclear. Here we identified the NTS-specific enhancer 
in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The AF4/FMR2 (AFF) family protein AFF1 occupies the
NTS enhancer and inhibits NTS transcription. Clustering analysis of lung
adenocarcinoma gene expression data demonstrated that NTS expression is highly
positively correlated with the expression of the oncogenic factor CPS1. Detailed 
analyses demonstrated that the IL6 pathway antagonizes NTS in regulating CPS1.
Thus, our analyses revealed a novel NTS-centered regulatory axis, consisting of
AFF1 as a master transcription suppressor and IL6 as an antagonist in lung
adenocarcinoma cells.

Neural cell adhesion molecules 1 (NCAM1) and 2 (NCAM2) belong to the cell
adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily and have been shown to
regulate formation, maturation, and maintenance of synapses. NCAM1 and NCAM2
undergo proteolysis, but the identity of all the proteases involved and how
proteolysis is used to regulate their functions are not known. We report here
that NCAM1 and NCAM2 are BACE1 substrates in vivo. NCAM1 and NCAM2 overexpressed 
in HEK cells were both cleaved by metalloproteinases or BACE1, and NCAM2 was also
processed by γ-secretase. We identified the BACE1 cleavage site of NCAM1 (at Glu 
671) and NCAM2 (at Glu 663) using mass spectrometry and site-directed
mutagenesis. Next, we assessed BACE1-mediated processing of NCAM1 and NCAM2 in
the mouse brain during aging. NCAM1 and NCAM2 were cleaved in the olfactory bulb 
of BACE1+/+ but not BACE1-/- mice at postnatal day 10 (P10), 4 and 12 months of
age. In the hippocampus, a BACE1-specific soluble fragment of NCAM1 (sNCAM1β) was
only detected at P10. However, we observed an accumulation of full-length NCAM1
in hippocampal synaptosomes in 4-month-old BACE1-/- mice. We also found that
polysialylated NCAM1 (PSA-NCAM1) levels were increased in BACE1-/- mice at P10
and demonstrated that BACE1 cleaves both NCAM1 and PSA-NCAM1 in vitro. In
contrast, we did not find evidence for BACE1-dependent NCAM2 processing in the
hippocampus at any age analyzed. In summary, our data demonstrate that BACE1
differentially processes NCAM1 and NCAM2 depending on the region of brain,
subcellular localization, and age in vivo.

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions that interfere with DNA
metabolic processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination. USP11 
deubiquitinase participates in DNA repair, but the role of USP11 in DPC repair is
not known. SPRTN is a replication-coupled DNA-dependent metalloprotease that
cleaves proteins cross-linked to DNA to promote DPC repair. SPRTN function is
tightly regulated by a monoubiquitin switch that controls SPRTN auto-proteolysis 
and chromatin accessibility during DPC repair. Previously, VCPIP1 and USP7
deubiquitinases have been shown to regulate SPRTN. Here, we identify USP11 as an 
SPRTN deubiquitinase. USP11 interacts with SPRTN and cleaves monoubiquitinated
SPRTN in cells and in vitro. USP11 depletion impairs SPRTN deubiquitination and
promotes SPRTN auto-proteolysis in response to formaldehyde-induced DPCs. Loss of
USP11 causes an accumulation of unrepaired DPCs and cellular hypersensitivity to 
treatment with DPC-inducing agents. Our findings show that USP11 regulates SPRTN 
auto-proteolysis and SPRTN-mediated DPC repair to maintain genome stability.

The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls 
organ size in animals via the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. It 
consists of a kinase cascade, in which MST1/2 and MAP4Ks phosphorylate and
activate LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ activity. A
variety of signals can modulate LATS1/2 kinase activity to regulate Hippo
pathway. However, the full mechanistic details of kinase-mediated regulation of
Hippo pathway signaling remain elusive. Here, we report that TNF activates
LATS1/2 and inhibits YAP/TAZ activity through MEKK2/3. Furthermore, MEKK2/3 act
in parallel to MST1/2 and MAP4Ks to regulate LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ in response to
various signals, such as serum and actin dynamics. Mechanistically, we show that 
MEKK2/3 interact with LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ and phosphorylate them. In addition,
Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex associates with
MEKK3 via CCM2 and CCM3 to inactivate MEKK3 kinase activity. Upstream signals of 
Hippo pathway trigger the dissociation of MEKK3 from STRIPAK complex to release
MEKK3 activity. Our work has uncovered a previous unrecognized regulation of
Hippo pathway via MEKK2/3 and provides new insights into molecular mechanisms for
the interplay between Hippo-YAP and NF-κB signaling and the pathogenesis of
cerebral cavernous malformations.

Components of the autophagy machinery are subject to regulation by various
posttranslational modifications. Previous studies showed that monoubiquitination 
of LC3B catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin ligase BIRC6 targets LC3B for proteasomal 
degradation, thus reducing LC3B levels and autophagic activity under conditions
of stress. However, mechanisms capable of counteracting this process are not
known. Herein, we report that LC3B ubiquitination is reversed by the action of
the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10. We identified USP10 in a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout 
screen for ubiquitination-related genes that regulate LC3B levels. Biochemical
analyses showed that silencing of USP10 reduces the levels of both the LC3B-I and
LC3B-II forms of LC3B through increased ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. In turn, the reduced LC3B levels result in slower degradation of the
autophagy receptors SQSTM1 and NBR1 and an increased accumulation of
puromycin-induced aggresome-like structures. Taken together, these findings
indicate that the levels of LC3B and autophagic activity are controlled through
cycles of LC3B ubiquitination and deubiquitination.

Ariadne-1 (Ari-1) is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase essential for neuronal development,
but whose neuronal substrates are yet to be identified. To search for putative
Ari-1 substrates, we used an in vivo ubiquitin biotinylation strategy coupled to 
quantitative proteomics of Drosophila heads. We identified 16 candidates that met
the established criteria: a significant change of at least twofold increase on
ubiquitination, with at least two unique peptides identified. Among those
candidates, we identified Comatose (Comt), the homologue of the N-ethylmaleimide 
sensitive factor (NSF), which is involved in neurotransmitter release. Using a
pull-down approach that relies on the overexpression and stringent isolation of a
GFP-fused construct, we validate Comt/NSF to be an ubiquitination substrate of
Ari-1 in fly neurons, resulting in the preferential monoubiquitination of
Comt/NSF. We tested the possible functional relevance of this modification using 
Ari-1 loss-of-function mutants, which displayed a lower rate of spontaneous
neurotransmitter release due to failures at the presynaptic side. By contrast,
evoked release in Ari-1 mutants was enhanced compared with controls in a
Ca2+-dependent manner without modifications in the number of active zones,
indicating that the probability of release per synapse is increased in these
mutants. This phenotype distinction between spontaneous and evoked release
suggests that NSF activity may discriminate between these two types of vesicle
fusion. Our results thus provide a mechanism to regulate NSF activity in the
synapse through Ari-1-dependent ubiquitination.

Induction of fetal hemoglobin to overcome adult β-globin gene deficiency is an
effective therapeutic strategy to ameliorate human β-hemoglobinopathies. Previous
work has revealed that fetal γ-globin can be translationally induced via
integrated stress signaling, but other studies have indicated that activating
stress may eventually suppress γ-globin expression transcriptionally. The
mechanism by which γ-globin expression is regulated at the translational level
remains largely unknown, limiting our ability to determine whether activating
stress is a realistic therapeutic option for these disorders. In this study, we
performed a functional CRISPR screen targeting protein arginine
methyltransferases (PRMTs) to look for changes in γ-globin expression in
K562 cells. We not only discovered that several specific PRMTs may block γ-globin
transcription, but also revealed PRMT1 as a unique family member that is able to 
suppress γ-globin synthesis specifically at the translational level. We further
identified that a non-AUG uORF within the 5' untranslated region of γ-globin
serves as a barrier for translation, which is bypassed upon PRMT1 deficiency.
Finally, we found that this novel mechanism of γ-globin suppression could be
pharmacologically targeted by the PRMT1 inhibitor, furamidine dihydrochloride.
These data raise new questions regarding methyltransferase function and may offer
a new therapeutic direction for β-hemoglobinopathies.

Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a multiorgan disorder caused by inactivation of 
the folliculin (FLCN) protein. Previously, we identified FLCN as a binding
protein of Rab11A, a key regulator of the endocytic recycling pathway. This
finding implies that the abnormal localization of specific proteins whose
transport requires the FLCN-Rab11A complex may contribute to BHD. Here, we used
human kidney-derived HEK293 cells as a model, and we report that FLCN promotes
the binding of Rab11A with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is required for
iron uptake through continuous trafficking between the cell surface and the
cytoplasm. Loss of FLCN attenuated the Rab11A-TfR1 interaction, resulting in
delayed recycling transport of TfR1. This delay caused an iron deficiency
condition that induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity, which was
reversed by iron supplementation. In a Drosophila model of BHD syndrome, we
further demonstrated that the phenotype of BHD mutant larvae was substantially
rescued by an iron-rich diet. These findings reveal a conserved function of FLCN 
in iron metabolism and may help to elucidate the mechanisms driving BHD syndrome.

The disease-initiating molecular events for age-related macular degeneration
(AMD), a multifactorial retinal disease affecting many millions of elderly
individuals worldwide, are still unknown. Of the over 30 risk and protective loci
so far associated with AMD through whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
the Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) gene locus represents one of
the most highly associated risk regions for AMD. A unique insertion/deletion
(in/del) sequence located immediately upstream of the High Temperature
Requirement A1 (HTRA1) gene in this region confers high risk for AMD. Using
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we identified that two Gtf2i-β/δ
transcription factor isoforms bind to the cis-element 5'- ATTAATAACC-3' contained
in this in/del sequence. The binding of these transcription factors leads to
enhanced upregulation of transcription of the secretory serine protease HTRA1 in 
transfected cells and AMD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
Overexpression of Htra1 in mice using a CAG-promoter demonstrated increased blood
concentration of Htra1 protein, caused upregulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), and produced a choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-like
phenotype. Finally, a comparison of 478 AMD patients to 481 healthy, age-matched 
controls from Japan, India, Australia, and the USA showed a statistically
increased level of secreted HTRA1 blood concentration in AMD patients compared
with age-matched controls. Taken together, these results suggest a common
mechanism across ethnicities whereby increased systemic blood circulation of
secreted serine protease HTRA1 leads to subsequent degradation of Bruch's
membrane and eventual CNV in AMD.

The type II sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPT2A) mediates renal
phosphate uptake. The NPT2A is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
fibroblast growth factor 23, which requires Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor-1
(NHERF1), a multidomain PDZ-containing phosphoprotein. Phosphocycling controls
the association between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Here, we characterize the critical 
involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6A (GRK6A) in mediating
PTH-sensitive phosphate transport by targeted phosphorylation coupled with NHERF1
conformational rearrangement, which in turn allows phosphorylation at a secondary
site. GRK6A, through its carboxy-terminal PDZ recognition motif, binds NHERF1
PDZ1 with greater affinity than PDZ2. However, the association between NHERF1
PDZ2 and GRK6A is necessary for PTH action. Ser162, a PKCα phosphorylation site
in PDZ2, regulates the binding affinity between PDZ2 and GRK6A. Substitution of
Ser162 with alanine (S162A) blocks the PTH action but does not disrupt the
interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Replacement of Ser162 with aspartic
acid (S162D) abrogates the interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A and
concurrently PTH action. We used amber codon suppression to generate a
phosphorylated Ser162(pSer162)-PDZ2 variant. KD values determined by fluorescence
anisotropy indicate that incorporation of pSer162 increased the binding affinity 
to the carboxy terminus of GRK6A 2-fold compared with WT PDZ2. Molecular dynamics
simulations predict formation of an electrostatic network between pSer162 and
Asp183 of PDZ2 and Arg at position -1 of the GRK6A PDZ-binding motif. Our results
suggest that PDZ2 plays a regulatory role in PTH-sensitive NPT2A-mediated
phosphate transport and phosphorylation of Ser162 in PDZ2 modulates the
interaction with GRK6A.

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genome stability primarily by correcting
replication errors. MMR deficiency can lead to cancer development and bolsters
cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. However, recent studies have shown that
checkpoint blockade therapy is effective in MMR-deficient cancers, thus the
ability to identify cancer etiology would greatly benefit cancer treatment. MutS 
homolog 2 (MSH2) is an obligate subunit of mismatch recognition proteins MutSα
(MSH2-MSH6) and MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3). Precise regulation of MSH2 is critical, as
either over- or underexpression of MSH2 results in an increased mutation
frequency. The mechanism by which cells maintain MSH2 proteostasis is unknown.
Using functional ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays, we show that the
ovarian tumor (OTU) family deubiquitinase ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 (OTUB1)
inhibits MSH2 ubiquitination by blocking the E2 ligase ubiquitin transfer
activity. Depleting OTUB1 in cells promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation of MSH2, leading to greater mutation frequency and cellular
resistance to genotoxic agents, including the common chemotherapy agents
N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and cisplatin. Taken together, our data
identify OTUB1 as an important regulator of MSH2 stability and provide evidence
that OTUB1 is a potential biomarker for cancer etiology and therapy.

Vascular calcification is the ectopic deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite
minerals in arterial wall, which involves the transdifferentiation of vascular
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) toward an osteogenic phenotype. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms regulating the VSMC osteogenic switch remain
incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the roles of microRNAs
(miRNAs) in vascular calcification. miRNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified
miR-223-3p as a candidate miRNA in calcified mouse aortas. MiR-223-3p knockout
aggravated calcification in both medial and atherosclerotic vascular
calcification models. Further, RNA-seq transcriptome analysis verified JAK-STAT
and PPAR signaling pathways were upregulated in both medial and atherosclerotic
calcified aortas. Overlapping genes in these signaling pathways with predicted
target genes of miR-223-3p derived from miRNA databases, we identified signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential target gene of
miR-223-3p in vascular calcification. In vitro experiments showed that miR-223-3p
blocked interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing the osteogenic
switch and calcification of VSMCs. In contrast, overexpression of STAT3
diminished the effect of miR-223-3p. Taken together, the results indicate a
protective role of miR-223-3p that inhibits both medial and atherosclerotic
vascular calcification by regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling-mediated VSMC
transdifferentiation.

Mutations in the human gene encoding the neuron-specific Eag1 voltage-gated K+
channel are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, indicating an important 
role of Eag1 during brain development. A disease-causing Eag1 mutation is linked 
to decreased protein stability that involves enhanced protein degradation by the 
E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7). The general mechanisms governing protein
homeostasis of plasma membrane- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Eag1 K+ 
channels, however, remain unclear. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we
identified another E3 ubiquitin ligase, makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), as
a novel binding partner primarily interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region
of Eag1. MKRN1 mainly interacts with ER-localized immature core-glycosylated, as 
well as nascent nonglycosylated, Eag1 proteins. MKRN1 promotes polyubiquitination
and ER-associated proteasomal degradation of immature Eag1 proteins. Although
both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to ER quality control of immature
core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins, MKRN1, but not CUL7, associates with and
promotes degradation of nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins at the ER. In
direct contrast to the role of CUL7 in regulating both ER and peripheral quality 
controls of Eag1, MKRN1 is exclusively responsible for the early stage of Eag1
maturation at the ER. We further demonstrated that both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute
to protein quality control of additional disease-causing Eag1 mutants associated 
with defective protein homeostasis. Our data suggest that the presence of this
dual ubiquitination system differentially maintains Eag1 protein homeostasis and 
may ensure efficient removal of disease-associated misfolded Eag1 mutant
channels.

Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with increasing incidence
worldwide. Pannexin1 (PANX1), a member of the pannexin family of channel-forming 
glycoproteins, regulates cellular processes in melanoma cells including
proliferation, migration, and invasion/metastasis. However, the mechanisms
responsible for coordinating and regulating PANX1 function remain unclear. Here, 
we demonstrated a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of PANX1 and
the N-terminal portion of β-catenin, a key transcription factor in the Wnt
pathway. At the protein level, β-catenin was significantly decreased when PANX1
was either knocked down or inhibited by two PANX1 blockers, Probenecid and
Spironolactone. Immunofluorescence imaging showed a disrupted pattern of
β-catenin localization at the cell membrane in PANX1-deficient cells, and
transcription of several Wnt target genes, including MITF, was suppressed. In
addition, a mitochondrial stress test revealed that the metabolism of
PANX1-deficient cells was impaired, indicating a role for PANX1 in the regulation
of the melanoma cell metabolic profile. Taken together, our data show that PANX1 
directly interacts with β-catenin to modulate growth and metabolism in melanoma
cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into PANX1-mediated melanoma
progression and may be applicable to other contexts where PANX1 and β-catenin
interact as a potential new component of the Wnt signaling pathway.

Human embryonic stem cells are a type of pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that are 
used to investigate their differentiation into diverse mature cell types for
molecular studies. The mechanisms underlying insulin receptor (IR)-mediated
signaling in the maintenance of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) identity and
cell fate specification are not fully understood. Here, we used two independent
shRNAs to stably knock down IRs in two hPSC lines that represent pluripotent stem
cells and explored the consequences on expression of key proteins in pathways
linked to proliferation and differentiation. We consistently observed lowered
pAKT in contrast to increased pERK1/2 and a concordant elevation in pluripotency 
gene expression. ERK2 chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assays, and
ERK1/2 inhibitors established direct causality between ERK1/2 and OCT4
expression. Of importance, RNA sequencing analyses indicated a dysregulation of
genes involved in cell differentiation and organismal development. Mass
spectrometry-based proteomic analyses further confirmed a global downregulation
of extracellular matrix proteins. Subsequent differentiation toward the neural
lineage reflected alterations in SOX1+PAX6+ neuroectoderm and FOXG1+ cortical
neuron marker expression and protein localization. Collectively, our data
underscore the role of IR-mediated signaling in maintaining pluripotency, the
extracellular matrix necessary for the stem cell niche, and regulating cell fate 
specification including the neural lineage.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) secreted by a variety of cell types are known 
to play essential roles in cell differentiation and matrix formation in the bone,
cartilage, muscle, blood vessel, and neuronal tissue. BMPs activate intracellular
effectors via C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad9, which relay 
the signaling by forming a complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus for 
transcriptional activation. Smad6 inhibits BMP signaling through diverse
mechanisms operative at the membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear levels. However, the
mechanistic underpinnings of Smad6 functional diversity remain unclear. Here,
using a biochemical approach and cell differentiation systems, we report a
cytosolic mechanism of action for Smad6 that requires arginine methylation at
arginine 81 (R81) and functions through association with Smad1 and interference
with the formation of Smad1-Smad4 complexes. By mutating the methylated arginine 
residue, R81, and by silencing the expression of protein arginine
methyltransferase 1, we show that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 catalyzes 
R81 methylation of Smad6 upon BMP treatment, R81 methylation subsequently
facilitates Smad6 interaction with the phosphorylated active Smad1, and R81
methylation facilitates Smad6-mediated interruption of Smad1-Smad4 complex
formation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, Smad6 WT but not the
methylation-deficient R81A mutant inhibited BMP-responsive transcription,
attenuated BMP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, and antagonized BMP-mediated 
inhibition of cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that R81
methylation plays an essential role in Smad6-mediated inhibition of BMP
responses.

F-box proteins β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 are paralogs present in the human genome. They
control several cellular processes including cell cycle and DNA damage signaling.
Moreover, it is reported that they facilitate DNA damage-induced accumulation of 
p53 by directing proteasomal degradation of MDM2, a protein that promotes p53
degradation. However, the individual roles of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 in the
genotoxic stress-induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage
repair remain largely unknown. Here, using biochemical, molecular biology, flow
cytometric, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2
communicate during genotoxic stress. We found that expression levels of β-TrCP1
are significantly increased while levels of β-TrCP2 are markedly decreased upon
induction of genotoxic stress. Further, our results revealed that DNA
damage-induced activation of ATM kinase plays an important role in maintaining
the reciprocal expression levels of β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 via the phosphorylation
of β-TrCP1 at Ser158. Phosphorylated β-TrCP1 potently promotes the proteasomal
degradation of β-TrCP2 and MDM2, resulting in the activation of p53.
Additionally, β-TrCP1 impedes MDM2 accumulation via abrogation of its lysine
63-linked polyubiquitination by β-TrCP2. Thus, β-TrCP1 helps to arrest cells at
the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and promotes DNA repair upon DNA damage through 
attenuation of β-TrCP2. Collectively, our findings elucidate an intriguing
posttranslational regulatory mechanism of these two paralogs under genotoxic
stress and revealed β-TrCP1 as a key player in maintaining the genome integrity
through the attenuation of β-TrCP2 levels in response to genotoxic stress.

The C1q and TNF related 4 (C1QTNF4) protein is a structurally unique member of
the C1QTNF family, a family of secreted proteins that have structural homology
with both complement C1q and the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. C1QTNF4 has
been linked to the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus through
genetic studies; however, its role in immunity and inflammation remains poorly
defined and a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 has yet to be identified. Here we 
report identification of nucleolin as a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 using
mass spectrometric analysis. Additionally, we present evidence that the
interaction between C1QTNF4 and nucleolin is mediated by the second C1q-like
domain of C1QTNF4 and the C terminus of nucleolin. We show that monocytes and B
cells are target cells of C1QTNF4 and observe extensive binding to dead cells.
Imaging flow cytometry experiments in monocytes show that C1QTNF4 becomes
actively internalized upon cell binding. Our results suggest that nucleolin may
serve as a docking molecule for C1QTNF4 and act in a context-dependent manner
through coreceptors. Taken together, these findings further our understanding of 
C1QTNF4's function in the healthy immune system and how dysfunction may
contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus.

The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 plays important roles in the
repolarization of atrial action potentials and regulation of the vascular tone.
While the modulation of Kv1.5 function has been well studied, less is known about
how the protein levels of Kv1.5 on the cell membrane are regulated. Here, through
electrophysiological and biochemical analyses of Kv1.5 channels heterologously
expressed in HEK293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, as well as
native Kv1.5 in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial
cardiomyocytes, we found that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM) diminished Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5) and
protein levels of Kv1.5 in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, PKC activation
led to monoubiquitination and degradation of the mature Kv1.5 proteins.
Overexpression of Vps24, a protein that sorts transmembrane proteins into
lysosomes via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, accelerated, whereas the
lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 completely prevented PKC-mediated Kv1.5
degradation. Kv1.5, but not Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, or Kv1.4, was uniquely sensitive
to PMA treatment. Sequence alignments suggested that residues within the N
terminus of Kv1.5 are essential for PKC-mediated Kv1.5 reduction. Using
N-terminal truncation as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that
Thr15 is the target site for PKC that mediates endocytic degradation of Kv1.5
channels. These findings indicate that alteration of protein levels in the plasma
membrane represents an important regulatory mechanism of Kv1.5 channel function
under PKC activation conditions.

Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are structurally similar proteins that primarily
mediate the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling responsible for
driving cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The dynamics of the
Smad2/3 phosphorylation provide the key mechanism for regulating the TGF-β
signaling pathway, but the details surrounding this phosphorylation remain
unclear. Here, using in vitro kinase assay coupled with mass spectrometry, we
identified for the first time that nemo-like kinase (NLK) regulates TGF-β
signaling via modulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the linker region.
TGF-β-mediated transcriptional and cellular responses are suppressed by NLK
overexpression, whereas NLK depletion exerts opposite effects. Specifically, we
discovered that NLK associates with Smad3 and phosphorylates the designated
serine residues located in the linker region of Smad2 and Smad3, which inhibits
phosphorylation at the C terminus, thereby decreasing the duration of TGF-β
signaling. Overall, this work demonstrates that phosphorylation on the linker
region of Smad2/3 by NLK counteracts the canonical phosphorylation in response to
TGF-β signals, thus providing new insight into the mechanisms governing TGF-β
signaling transduction.

Cells can switch between Rac1 (lamellipodia-based) and RhoA (blebbing-based)
migration modes, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this shift are not fully
understood. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol
to yield phosphatidic acid, forms independent complexes with Rac1 and RhoA,
selectively dissociating each from their common inhibitor RhoGDI. DGKζ catalytic 
activity is required for Rac1 dissociation but is dispensable for RhoA
dissociation; instead, DGKζ stimulates RhoA release via a kinase-independent
scaffolding mechanism. The molecular determinants that mediate the selective
targeting of DGKζ to Rac1 or RhoA signaling complexes are unknown. Here, we show 
that protein kinase Cα (PKCα)-mediated phosphorylation of the DGKζ MARCKS domain 
increased DGKζ association with RhoA and decreased its interaction with Rac1. The
same modification also enhanced DGKζ interaction with the scaffold protein
syntrophin. Expression of a phosphomimetic DGKζ mutant stimulated membrane
blebbing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts, which was augmented 
by inhibition of endogenous Rac1. DGKζ expression in differentiated C2 myotubes, 
which have low endogenous Rac1 levels, also induced substantial membrane blebbing
via the RhoA-ROCK pathway. These events were independent of DGKζ catalytic
activity, but dependent upon a functional C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Rescue of
RhoA activity in DGKζ-null cells also required the PDZ-binding motif, suggesting 
that syntrophin interaction is necessary for optimal RhoA activation.
Collectively, our results define a switch-like mechanism whereby DGKζ
phosphorylation by PKCα plays a role in the interconversion between Rac1 and RhoA
signaling pathways that underlie different cellular migration modes.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits gene expression homeostasis, which is defined
as the buffering of transcription levels against changes in DNA copy number
during the S phase of the cell cycle. It has been suggested that S. cerevisiae
employs an active mechanism to maintain gene expression homeostasis through
Rtt109-Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56). Here, we
show that gene expression homeostasis can be achieved independently of H3K56
acetylation by Tos4 (Target of Swi6-4). Using Nanostring technology, we establish
that Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis depends on its
forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is a phosphopeptide recognition domain
required to bind histone deacetylases (HDACs). We demonstrate that the mechanism 
of Tos4-dependent gene expression homeostasis requires its interaction with the
Rpd3L HDAC complex. However, this is independent of Rpd3's well-established roles
in both histone deacetylation and controlling the DNA replication timing program,
as established by deep sequencing of Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorted (FACS) S 
and G2 phase populations. Overall, our data reveals that Tos4 mediates gene
expression homeostasis through its FHA domain-dependent interaction with the
Rpd3L complex, which is independent of H3K56ac.

The functions of long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, such as MEG3, are defined by their
interactions with other RNAs and proteins. These interactions, in turn, are
shaped by their subcellular localization and temporal context. Therefore, it is
important to be able to analyze the relationships of lncRNAs while preserving
cellular architecture. The ability of MEG3 to suppress cell proliferation led to 
its recognition as a tumor suppressor. MEG3 has been proposed to activate p53 by 
disrupting the interaction of p53 with mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2). To
test this mechanism in the native cellular context, we employed two-color direct 
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, a single-molecule localization
microscopy technique, to detect and quantify the localizations of p53, Mdm2, and 
MEG3 in U2OS cells. We developed a new cross-nearest neighbor/Monte Carlo
algorithm to quantify the association of these molecules. Proof of concept for
our method was obtained by examining the association between FKBP1A and mTOR,
MEG3 and p53, and Mdm2 and p53. In contrast to previous models, our data support 
a model in which MEG3 modulates p53 independently of the interaction with Mdm2.

The present study aimed to explore specific mechanisms involved in mediating the 
neuroprotective effects of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) in
cerebral ischemic injury. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model
and an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated neuron model were developed. The 
expression of Smurf2, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α),
and DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 gene (DDIT4) was analyzed. Thereafter, the 
expression of Smurf2, YY1, HIF1α, and DDIT4 was altered in the MCAO mice and
OGD-treated neurons. Apoptosis in tissues and cerebral infarction were assessed. 
In neurons, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, viability, and
apoptosis were assessed, followed by evaluation of lactate dehydrogenase leakage 
rate. The interaction between Smurf2 and YY1 was analyzed by
coimmunoprecipitation assay and that between YY1 ubiquitination by in vivo
ubiquitination experiment. The results showed downregulation of Smurf2 and
upregulation of YY1, HIF1α, and DDIT4 in both MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. 
Smurf2 elevated YY1 ubiquitination and degradation, and YY1 increased HIF1α
expression to promote DDIT4 in neurons. Overexpressed Smurf2 or downregulated
YY1, HIF1α, or DDIT4 reduced the volume of cerebral infarction and apoptosis in
MCAO mice, while enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis and lactate
dehydrogenase leakage in OGD-treated neurons. In summary, our findings elucidated
a neuroprotective role of Smurf2 in cerebral ischemic injury via inactivation of 
the YY1/HIF1α/DDIT4 axis.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute to the deposition of
extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), including Type IV collagen, in the vessel
wall. ECMs coordinate communication among different cell types, but mechanisms
underlying this communication remain unclear. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is activated and contributes to 
VSMC phenotypic transition in response to vascular injury. In this study, we
investigated the participation of XBP1 in the communication between VSMCs and
vascular progenitor cells (VPCs). Immunofluorescence and immunohistology staining
revealed that Xbp1 gene was essential for type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1)
expression during mouse embryonic development and vessel wall ECM deposition and 
stem cell antigen 1-positive (Sca1+)-VPC recruitment in response to vascular
injury. The Western blot analysis elucidated an Xbp1 gene dose-dependent effect
on COL4A1 expression and that the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) increased
protease-mediated COL4A1 degradation as revealed by Zymography. RT-PCR analysis
revealed that XBP1s in VSMCs not only upregulated COL4A1/2 transcription but also
induced the occurrence of a novel transcript variant, soluble type IV collagen
alpha 1 (COL4A1s), in which the front part of exon 4 is joined with the rear part
of exon 42. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation, DNA/protein pulldown and in vitro
transcription demonstrated that XBP1s binds to exon 4 and exon 42, directing the 
transcription from exon 4 to exon 42. This leads to transcription complex
bypassing the internal sequences, producing a shortened COL4A1s protein that
increased Sca1+-VPC migration. Taken together, these results suggest that
activated VSMCs may recruit Sca1+-VPCs via XBP1s-mediated COL4A1s secretion,
leading to vascular injury repair or neointima formation.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling promotes cancer progression. In
particular, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β is
considered crucial to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Here, we report
that the EMT-associated cellular responses induced by TGF-β are mediated by
distinct signaling pathways that diverge at Smad3. By expressing chimeric
Smad1/Smad3 proteins in SMAD3 knockout A549 cells, we found that the β4 region in
the Smad3 MH1 domain is essential for TGF-β-induced cell motility, but is not
essential for other EMT-associated responses including epithelial marker
downregulation. TGF-β was previously reported to enhance cell motility by
activating Rac1 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Intriguingly, TGF-β-dependent
signaling mediated by Smad3's β4 region causes the downregulation of multiple
mRNAs that encode GTPase activating proteins that target Rac1 (ARHGAPs), thereby 
attenuating Rac1 inactivation. Therefore, two independent pathways downstream of 
TGF-β type I receptor contribute cooperatively to sustained Rac1 activation,
thereby leading to enhanced cell motility.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that 
plays a central role in inflammation. The GR activity is also modulated via
protein-protein interactions, including binding of 14-3-3 proteins induced by GR 
phosphorylation. However, the specific phosphorylation sites on the GR that
trigger these interactions and their functional consequences are less clear.
Hence, we sought to examine this system in more detail. We used phosphorylated GR
peptides, biophysical studies, and X-ray crystallography to identify key residues
within the ligand-binding domain of the GR, T524 and S617, whose phosphorylation 
results in binding of the representative 14-3-3 protein 14-3-3ζ. A kinase screen 
identified misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) as responsible for phosphorylating
T524 and Rho-associated protein kinase 1 for phosphorylating S617; cell-based
approaches confirmed the importance of both GR phosphosites and MINK1 but not
Rho-associated protein kinase 1 alone in inducing GR-14-3-3 binding. Together our
results provide molecular-level insight into 14-3-3-mediated regulation of the GR
and highlight both MINK1 and the GR-14-3-3 axis as potential targets for future
therapeutic intervention.

The phosphatase cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) regulates cell cycle
progression. Increased Cdc25B levels are often detected in cancer cell lines and 
human cancers and have been implicated in contributing to tumor growth,
potentially by providing cancer cells with the ability to bypass checkpoint
controls. However, the specific mechanism by which increased Cdc25B impacts tumor
progression is not clear. Here we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database and found that patients with high CDC25B expression had the expected
poor survival. However, we also found that high CDC25B expression had a
p53-dependent tumor suppressive effect in lung cancer and possibly several other 
cancer types. Looking in more detail at the tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B,
we found that increased Cdc25B expression caused inhibition of cell growth in
human normal fibroblasts. This effect was not due to alteration of specific cell 
cycle stage or inhibition of apoptosis, nor by induction of the DNA damage
response. Instead, increased CDC25B expression led cells into senescence. We also
found that p53 was required to induce senescence, which might explain the
p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of Cdc25B. Mechanistically, we found
that the Cdc25B phosphatase activity was required to induce senescence. Further
analysis also found that Cdc25B stabilized p53 through binding and
dephosphorylating p53. Together, this study identified a tumor-suppressive
function of Cdc25B that is mediated through a p53-dependent senescence pathway.

In eukaryotes, various alternative translation initiation mechanisms have been
unveiled for the translation of specific mRNAs. Some do not conform to the
conventional scanning-initiation model. Translation initiation of histone H4 mRNA
combines both canonical (cap-dependent) and viral initiation strategies
(no-scanning, internal recruitment of initiation factors). Specific H4 mRNA
structures tether the translation machinery directly onto the initiation codon
and allow massive production of histone H4 during the S phase of the cell cycle. 
The human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), composed of 13
subunits (a-m), was shown to selectively recruit and control the expression of
several cellular mRNAs. Whether eIF3 mediates H4 mRNA translation remains to be
elucidated. Here, we report that eIF3 binds to a stem-loop structure (eIF3-BS)
located in the coding region of H4 mRNA. Combining cross-linking and
ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation experiments in vivo and in vitro, we also
found that eIF3 binds to H1, H2A, H2B, and H3 histone mRNAs. We identified direct
contacts between eIF3c, d, e, g subunits, and histone mRNAs but observed distinct
interaction patterns to each histone mRNA. Our results show that eIF3 depletion
in vivo reduces histone mRNA binding and modulates histone neosynthesis,
suggesting that synthesis of histones is sensitive to the levels of eIF3. Thus,
we provide evidence that eIF3 acts as a regulator of histone translation.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a fundamental signaling
pathway that regulates cell fate decisions in response to external stimuli.
Several scaffold proteins bind directly to kinase components of this pathway and 
regulate their activation by growth factors. One of the best studied MAPK
scaffolds is kinase suppressor of Ras1 (KSR1), which is induced by epidermal
growth factor (EGF) to translocate to the plasma membrane where it activates
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). While Ca2+ has been shown to
modulate MAPK signaling, the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are
incompletely understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ alters MAPK
activity at least in part via KSR1. Using several approaches, including fusion
proteins, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a cell-permeable chemical
inhibitor, we investigated the functional interaction between KSR1 and
calmodulin. In vitro analysis with pure proteins reveals that calmodulin binds
directly to KSR1. Moreover, endogenous calmodulin and KSR1 co-immunoprecipitate
from mammalian cell lysates. Importantly, Ca2+ is required for the association
between calmodulin and KSR1, both in vitro and in cells. The cell-permeable
calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B significantly reduced activation of ERK by EGF in 
mouse embryo fibroblasts that overexpress KSR1, but not in control cells.
Moreover, CGS9343B impaired the ability of EGF to induce KSR1 translocation to
the plasma membrane and to stimulate formation of KSR1-ERK and KSR1-pERK
(phosphorylated ERK) complexes in cells. Collectively, our data identify a
previously unrecognized mechanism by which the scaffold protein KSR1 couples Ca2+
and calmodulin signaling to the MAPK cascade.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a natural multifunctional phospholipid, is highly 
increased in plasma from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and
mediates proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) by
activating the Notch3 signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underpinning
S1P-mediated induction of PASMCs proliferation remain unclear. In this study,
using biochemical and molecular biology approaches, RNA interference and gene
expression analyses, 5'-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, we
demonstrated that S1P promoted the activation of signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 
(S1PR2), and subsequently upregulated the expression of the microRNA miR-135b,
which further reduced the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase β-transduction
repeat-containing protein and led to a reduction in yes-associated protein (YAP) 
ubiquitinated degradation in PASMCs. YAP is the core effector of the Hippo
pathway and mediates the expression of particular genes. The accumulation of YAP 
further increased the expression and activation of Notch3 and ultimately promoted
the proliferation of PASMCs. In addition, we showed that preblocking S1PR2, prior
silencing of STAT3, miR-135b, or YAP, and prior inhibition of Notch3 all
attenuated S1P-induced PASMCs proliferation. Taken together, our study indicates 
that S1P stimulates PASMCs proliferation by activation of the
S1PR2/STAT3/miR-135b/β-transduction repeat-containing protein/YAP/Notch3 pathway,
and our data suggest that targeting this cascade might have potential value in

The membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 
are synthesized de novo by the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy)
pathway, in which the extracellular substrates choline and ethanolamine are
transported into the cell, phosphorylated, and coupled with diacylglycerol to
form the final phospholipid product. Although multiple transport systems have
been established for choline, ethanolamine transport is poorly characterized and 
there is no single protein assigned a transport function for ethanolamine. The
solute carriers 44A (SLC44A) known as choline transporter-like proteins-1 and -2 
(CTL1 and CTL2) are choline transporter at the plasma membrane and mitochondria. 
We report a novel function of CTL1 and CTL2 in ethanolamine transport. Using the 
lack or the gain of gene function in combination with specific antibodies and
transport inhibitors we established two distinct ethanolamine transport systems
of a high affinity, mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity, mediated by CTL2.
Both transporters are Na+-independent ethanolamine/H+ antiporters. Primary human 
fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations in the CTL1 gene (M1=
SLC44A1ΔAsp517 and M2= SLC44A1ΔSer126) are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport 
but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of CTL1 in M2 cells reduced the 
ethanolamine transport, the flux through the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway,
and PE synthesis. In contrast, overexpression of CTL1 in M2 cells improved
ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. These data firmly establish that CTL1
and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in whole cells and
mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the Kennedy pathway
and intracellular redistribution of ethanolamine.

Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone formation and bone
resorption. Traditional drugs for treating osteoporosis are associated with
serious side effects, and thus, new treatment methods are required. This study
investigated the role of differentially expressed microRNAs during osteoclast
differentiation and osteoclast activity during osteoarthritis as well as the
associated underlying mechanisms. We used a microarray to screen microRNAs that
decreased in the process of osteoclast differentiation and verified miR-21-5p to 
decrease significantly using RT-qPCR. In follow-up experiments, we found that
miR-21-5p targets SKP2 to regulate osteoclast differentiation. In vivo,
ovariectomized mice were used to simulate perimenopausal osteoporosis induced by 
estrogen deficiency, and miR-21-5p treatment inhibited bone resorption and
maintained bone cortex and trabecular structure. These results suggest that
miR-21-5p is a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis.

The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
receptor, is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of
HDL-cholesterol and cholesterol ester (CE) into cells. SR-B1 is subject to
posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain
obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1
(GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes
SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation
pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by 
co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1 ± GIPC1 
overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues.
Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently
increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and
total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was 
associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and
attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified
between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from 
human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from
human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the
stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid
and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory
roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface
receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol
metabolic processes.

Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a predominantly nuclear RNA-binding protein with key
functions in RNA processing and DNA damage repair. Defects in nuclear import of
FUS have been linked to severe neurodegenerative diseases; hence, it is of great 
interest to understand this process and how it is dysregulated in disease.
Transportin-1 (TNPO1) and the closely related transportin-2 have been identified 
as major nuclear import receptors of FUS. They bind to the C-terminal nuclear
localization signal of FUS and mediate the protein's nuclear import and at the
same time also suppress aberrant phase transitions of FUS in the cytoplasm.
Whether FUS can utilize other nuclear transport receptors for the purpose of
import and chaperoning has not been examined so far. Here, we show that FUS
directly binds to different import receptors in vitro. FUS formed stable
complexes not only with TNPO1 but also with transportin-3, importin β, importin
7, or the importin β/7 heterodimer. Binding of these alternative import receptors
required arginine residues within FUS-RG/RGG motifs and was weakened by arginine 
methylation. Interaction with these importins suppressed FUS phase separation and
reduced its sequestration into stress granules. In a permeabilized cell system,
we further showed that transportin-3 had the capacity to import FUS into the
nucleus, albeit with lower efficiency than TNPO1. Our data suggest that
aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins such as FUS may utilize a network of
importins for chaperoning and import, similar to histones and ribosomal proteins.

Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane
proteases, is involved in the activation of the σE extracytoplasmic stress
response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane.
However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this
study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search 
for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our
data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the
fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient
strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the
transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma
factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with 
a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of
RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec
operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed
that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP
participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the
N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of
the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP
for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient
role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane
proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating 
iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.

Human cell division is a highly regulated process that relies on the accurate
capture and movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Errors in the
fidelity of chromosome congression and alignment can lead to improper chromosome 
segregation, which is correlated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. These
processes are known to be regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2
(ERK2) in other species, but the role of ERK2 in mitosis in mammals remains
unclear. Here, we have identified the dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7),
known to display selectivity for ERK2, as important in regulating chromosome
alignment. During mitosis, DUSP7 bound to ERK2 and regulated the abundance of
active phospho-ERK2 through its phosphatase activity. Overexpression of DUSP7,
but not catalytically inactive mutants, led to a decrease in the levels of
phospho-ERK2 and mitotic chromosome misalignment, while knockdown of DUSP7 also
led to defective chromosome congression that resulted in a prolonged mitosis.
Consistently, knockdown or chemical inhibition of ERK2 or chemical inhibition of 
the MEK kinase that phosphorylates ERK2 led to chromosome alignment defects. Our 
results support a model wherein MEK-mediated phosphorylation and DUSP7-mediated
dephosphorylation regulate the levels of active phospho-ERK2 to promote proper
cell division.

TBC1D4 is a 160 kDa multidomain Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) and a
downstream target of the insulin- and contraction-activated kinases AKT and AMPK.
Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 has been linked to translocation of GLUT4 from storage 
vesicles (GSVs) to the cell surface. However, its impact on enzymatic activity is
not well understood, as previous studies mostly investigated the truncated GAP
domain lacking the known phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we
expressed and purified recombinant full-length TBC1D4 using a baculovirus system.
Size-exclusion chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that
full-length TBC1D4 forms oligomers of ∼600 kDa. Compared with the truncated GAP
domain, full-length TBC1D4 displayed similar substrate specificity, but had a
markedly higher specific GAP activity toward Rab10. Using high-resolution mass
spectrometry, we mapped 19 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in TBC1D4. We determined
Michaelis-Menten kinetics using in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified
kinases and stable isotope-labeled γ-[18O4]-ATP. These data revealed that Ser324 
(KM ∼6 μM) and Thr649 (KM ∼25 μM) were preferential sites for phosphorylation by 
AKT, whereas Ser348, Ser577, Ser595 (KM ∼10 μM), Ser711 (KM ∼79 μM), and Ser764
were found to be preferred targets for AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by AKT or 
AMPK did not alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity, but did disrupt interaction
with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a resident protein of GSVs
implicated in GLUT4 trafficking. These findings provide evidence that insulin and
contraction may regulate TBC1D4 function primarily by disrupting the recruitment 
of the RabGAP to GLUT4 vesicles.

Protein aggregation is the abnormal association of misfolded proteins into
larger, often insoluble structures that can be toxic during aging and in protein 
aggregation-associated diseases. Previous research has established a role for the
cytosolic Tsa1 peroxiredoxin in responding to protein misfolding stress. Tsa1 is 
also known to downregulate the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway as part of the
response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is
involved in protein misfolding stress is not known. Using transcriptomics, we
examined the response to protein misfolding stress and found upregulation of
numerous stress gene functions and downregulation of many genes related to
protein synthesis and other growth-related processes consistent with the
well-characterized environmental stress response. The scope of the
transcriptional response is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains,
but the magnitude is dampened in the strain lacking Tsa1. We identified a direct 
protein interaction between Tsa1 and the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is
present under normal growth conditions and explains the observed differences in
gene expression profiles. This interaction is increased in a redox-dependent
manner in response to nascent protein misfolding, via Tsa1-mediated oxidation of 
Bcy1. Oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens
PKA pathway activity, leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression.
Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA provides a mechanism to
mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to 
stress caused by exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species.

Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor that binds
substrate proteins and facilitates their proteasomal degradation. Most SPOP
substrates present multiple SPOP-binding (SB) motifs and undergo liquid-liquid
phase separation with SPOP. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), an insulin
transcription factor, is downregulated by interaction with SPOP. Unlike other
substrates, only one SB motif has previously been reported within the Pdx1
C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (Pdx1-C). Given this difference, we
aimed to determine the specific mode of interaction of Pdx1 with SPOP and how it 
is similar or different to that of other SPOP substrates. Here, we identify a
second SB motif in Pdx1-C, but still find that the resulting moderate valency is 
insufficient to support phase separation with SPOP in cells. Although Pdx1 does
not phase separate with SPOP, Pdx1 and SPOP interaction prompts SPOP
relocalization from nuclear speckles to the diffuse nucleoplasm. Accordingly, we 
find that SPOP-mediated ubiquitination activity of Pdx1 occurs in the nucleoplasm
and that highly efficient Pdx1 turnover requires both SB motifs. Our results
suggest that the subnuclear localization of SPOP-substrate interactions and
substrate ubiquitination may be directed by the properties of the substrate
itself.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a critical transcription
factor that orchestrates cellular responses to oxidative stress. Because the
dysregulation of Nrf2 has been implicated in many diseases, precise regulation of
its protein level is crucial for maintaining homeostasis.
Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and WD40 repeat protein 23 (WDR23)
directly regulate Nrf2 levels via similar but distinct proteasome-dependent
pathways. WDR23 forms a part of the WDR23-Cullin 4A-RING ubiquitin ligase complex
(CRL4AWDR23), whereas Keap1 serves as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin
3-containing ubiquitin ligase complex. However, the mechanisms underlying
crosstalk between these Keap1 and WDR23 pathways for the regulation of Nrf2
levels have not been investigated. Here, we showed that knockdown (KD) of Keap1
upregulated the expression of Cullin4A (CUL4A) in a specificity protein 1
(Sp1)-dependent manner. We also revealed that Sp1 interacted with Keap1, leading 
to ubiquitination of Sp1. Increases in Sp1 by Keap1 KD triggered Sp1 binding to
the fourth Sp1 binding site (Sp1_M4) within the -230/+50 region of the CUL4A
gene. We also demonstrated that the overexpression and KD of Sp1 reduced and
increased Nrf2 protein levels, respectively. These effects were abrogated by the 
WDR23 KD, suggesting that Sp1 also regulates Nrf2 levels via the ubiquitin ligase
complex CRL4AWDR23. In conclusion, we discovered Sp1 as a novel substrate of
Keap1 and provided evidence that Sp1 regulates the expression of CUL4A. We
revealed a novel role for Sp1 in mediating crosstalk between two independent
regulators of Nrf2 protein levels.

miRNAs are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. The
post-transcriptional maturation of miRNAs is controlled by the Drosha-DiGeorge
syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) microprocessor. Dysregulation of miRNA
biogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including
cancers. C-terminal-binding protein-interacting protein (CtIP) is a well-known
DNA repair factor that promotes the processing of DNA double-strand break (DSB)
to initiate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair. However, it was unclear
whether CtIP has other unknown cellular functions. Here, we aimed to uncover the 
roles of CtIP in miRNA maturation and cancer cell metastasis. We found that CtIP 
is a potential regulatory factor that suppresses the processing of miRNA primary 
transcripts (pri-miRNA). CtIP directly bound to both DGCR8 and pri-miRNAs through
a conserved Sae2-like domain, reduced the binding of Drosha to DGCR8 and
pri-miRNA substrate, and inhibited processing activity of Drosha complex. CtIP
depletion significantly increased the expression levels of a subset of mature
miRNAs, including miR-302 family members that are associated with tumor
progression and metastasis in several cancer types. We also found that
CtIP-inhibited miRNAs, such as miR-302 family members, are not crucial for DSB
repair. However, increase of miR-302b levels or loss of CtIP function severely
suppressed human colon cancer cell line tumor cell metastasis in a mouse
xenograft model. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of CtIP
in miRNA processing and tumor metastasis that represents a new function of CtIP
in cancer.

The retinal insulin receptor (IR) exhibits basal kinase activity equivalent to
that of the liver of fed animals, but unlike the liver, does not fluctuate with
feeding and fasting; it also declines rapidly after the onset of
insulin-deficient diabetes. The ligand(s) that determine basal IR activity in the
retina has not been identified. Using a highly sensitive insulin assay, we found 
that retinal insulin concentrations remain constant in fed versus fasted rats and
in diabetic versus control rats; vitreous fluid insulin levels were undetectable.
Neutralizing antibodies against insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), but not
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or insulin, decreased IR kinase activity in 
normal rat retinas, and depletion of IGF-2 from serum specifically reduced IR
phosphorylation in retinal cells. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that
IGF-2 induced greater phosphorylation of the retinal IR than the IGF-1 receptor. 
Retinal IGF-2 mRNA content was 10-fold higher in adults than pups and orders of
magnitude higher than in liver. Diabetes reduced retinal IGF-2, but not IGF-1 or 
IR, mRNA levels, and reduced IGF-2 and IGF-1 content in vitreous fluid. Finally, 
intravitreal administration of IGF-2 (mature and pro-forms) increased retinal IR 
and Akt kinase activity in diabetic rats. Collectively, these data reveal that
IGF-2 is the primary ligand that defines basal retinal IR activity and suggest
that reduced ocular IGF-2 may contribute to reduced IR activity in response to
diabetes. These findings may have importance for understanding the regulation of 
metabolic and prosurvival signaling in the retina.

Overconsumption of sucrose and other sugars has been associated with nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Reports suggest hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) as
an important contributor to and regulator of carbohydrate-induced hepatic lipid
accumulation in NAFLD. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in hepatic DNL
due to overconsumption of carbohydrate diet are less than clear; however,
literatures suggest high carbohydrate diet to activate the lipogenic
transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP),
which further transcribes genes involved in DNL. Here, we provide an evidence of 
an unknown link between nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B 
cells (NF-κB) activation and increased DNL. Our data indicates high carbohydrate 
diet to enforce nuclear shuttling of hepatic NF-κB p65 and repress transcript
levels of sorcin, a cytosolic interacting partner of ChREBP. Reduced sorcin
levels, further prompted ChREBP nuclear translocation, leading to enhanced DNL
and intrahepatic lipid accumulation both in vivo and in vitro. We further report 
that pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB abrogated high carbohydrate
diet-mediated sorcin repression and thereby prevented ChREBP nuclear
translocation and this, in turn, attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation both in
in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, sorcin knockdown blunted the lipid-lowering
ability of the NF-κB inhibitor in vitro. Together, these data suggest a
heretofore unknown role for NF-κB in regulating ChREBP nuclear localization and
activation, in response to high carbohydrate diet, for further explorations in
lines of NAFLD therapeutics.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological forms of tau are transferred from cell 
to cell and "seed" aggregation of cytoplasmic tau. Phosphorylation of tau plays a
key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), 
a major component of lipoproteins in the brain, is a genetic risk determinant for
AD. The identification of the apoE receptor, low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), as an endocytic receptor for tau raises
several questions about the role of LRP1 in tauopathies: is internalized tau,
like other LRP1 ligands, delivered to lysosomes for degradation, and does LRP1
internalize pathological tau leading to cytosolic seeding? We found that LRP1
rapidly internalizes 125I-labeled tau, which is then efficiently degraded in
lysosomal compartments. Surface plasmon resonance experiments confirm high
affinity binding of tau and the tau microtubule-binding domain to LRP1.
Interestingly, phosphorylated forms of recombinant tau bind weakly to LRP1 and
are less efficiently internalized by LRP1. LRP1-mediated uptake of tau is
inhibited by apoE, with the apoE4 isoform being the most potent inhibitor, likely
because of its higher affinity for LRP1. Employing post-translationally-modified 
tau derived from brain lysates of human AD brain tissue, we found that
LRP1-expressing cells, but not LRP1-deficient cells, promote cytosolic tau
seeding in a process enhanced by apoE. These studies identify LRP1 as an
endocytic receptor that binds and processes monomeric forms of tau leading to its
degradation and promotes seeding by pathological forms of tau. The balance of
these processes may be fundamental to the spread of neuropathology across the
brain in AD.

RAS effectors specifically interact with GTP-bound RAS proteins to link
extracellular signals to downstream signaling pathways. These interactions rely
on two types of domains, called RAS-binding (RB) and RAS association (RA)
domains, which share common structural characteristics. Although the molecular
nature of RAS-effector interactions is well-studied for some proteins, most of
the RA/RB-domain-containing proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we
searched through human proteome databases, extracting 41 RA domains in 39
proteins and 16 RB domains in 14 proteins, each of which can specifically select 
at least one of the 25 members in the RAS family. We next comprehensively
investigated the sequence-structure-function relationship between different
representatives of the RAS family, including HRAS, RRAS, RALA, RAP1B, RAP2A,
RHEB1, and RIT1, with all members of RA domain family proteins (RASSFs) and the
RB-domain-containing CRAF. The binding affinity for RAS-effector interactions,
determined using fluorescence polarization, broadly ranged between high (0.3 μM) 
and very low (500 μM) affinities, raising interesting questions about the
consequence of these variable binding affinities in the regulation of signaling
events. Sequence and structural alignments pointed to two interaction hotspots in
the RA/RB domains, consisting of an average of 19 RAS-binding residues. Moreover,
we found novel interactions between RRAS1, RIT1, and RALA and RASSF7, RASSF9, and
RASSF1, respectively, which were systematically explored in
sequence-structure-property relationship analysis, and validated by mutational
analysis. These data provide a set of distinct functional properties and putative
biological roles that should now be investigated in the cellular context.

Platelets are key mediators of physiological hemostasis and pathological
thrombosis, whose function must be carefully balanced by signaling downstream of 
receptors such as protease-activated receptor (PAR)4. Protein kinase C (PKC) is
known to regulate various aspects of platelet function. For instance, PKCδ is
known to regulate dense granule secretion, which is important for platelet
activation. However, the mechanism by which PKCδ regulates this process as well
as other facets of platelet activity is unknown. We speculated that the way PKCδ 
regulates platelet function may be because of the phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues on PKCδ. We investigated phosphorylation of PKCδ following glycoprotein 
VI-mediated and PAR4-mediated platelet activation and found that Y311 is
selectively phosphorylated when PAR4 is activated in human platelets. Therefore, 
we generated PKCδ Y311F knock-in mice, which are viable and have no gross
abnormalities. However, PKCδY311F mice have significantly enhanced tail-bleeding 
times compared with WT littermate controls, which means hemostasis is
interrupted. Furthermore, PKCδY311F mice exhibit longer time to carotid artery
occlusion compared with WT control using a ferric chloride in vivo thrombosis
model, indicating that the phosphorylation of PKCδ Y311 is prothrombotic. Washed 
platelets from PKCδY311F mice have reduced reactivity after stimulation with a
PAR-4 agonist indicating its importance in platelet signaling. The phenotype
observed in Y311F mouse platelets is because of reduced thromboxane generation,
as an inhibitor of thromboxane generation equalizes the PKCδY311F platelet
response to that of WT. Therefore, phosphorylation of PKCδ on Y311 is important
for regulation of platelet function and specifically thromboxane generation,
which reinforces platelet activation.

Aberrant or constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) contributes
to various human inflammatory diseases and malignancies via the upregulation of
genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, and
metastasis. Thus, inhibition of NF-κB signaling has potential for therapeutic
applications in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We reported previously that
Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase, is involved in
the preferential repair of oxidized DNA bases from the transcriptionally active
sequences via the transcription-coupled base excision repair pathway. We have
further shown that Neil2-null mice are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor 
α (TNFα)- and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Both TNFα and
lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of NF-κB. However, the underlying
mechanism of NEIL2's role in the NF-κB-mediated inflammation remains elusive.
Here, we have documented a noncanonical function of NEIL2 and demonstrated that
the expression of genes, such as Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Il6, and Tnfα, involved in
inflammation and immune cell migration was significantly higher in both mock- and
TNFα-treated Neil2-null mice compared with that in the WT mice. NEIL2 blocks
NF-κB's binding to target gene promoters by directly interacting with the Rel
homology region of RelA and represses proinflammatory gene expression as
determined by co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and
electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Remarkably, intrapulmonary administration 
of purified NEIL2 via a noninvasive nasal route significantly abrogated binding
of NF-κB to cognate DNA, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory genes
and neutrophil recruitment in Neil2-null as well as WT mouse lungs. Our findings 
thus highlight the potential of NEIL2 as a biologic for inflammation-associated
human diseases.

The nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) transcription factor performs a
critical role in regulating cellular homeostasis as part of the cellular stress
response and drives the expression of antioxidants and detoxification enzymes
among many other functions. Ubiquitination plays an important role in controlling
the abundance and thus nuclear accumulation of Nrf1 proteins, but the regulatory 
enzymes that act on Nrf1 are not fully defined. Here, we identified ubiquitin
specific protease 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinating enzyme, as a novel regulator of
Nrf1 activity. We found that USP7 interacts with Nrf1a and TCF11-the two long
protein isoforms of Nrf1. Expression of wildtype USP7, but not its catalytically 
defective mutant, resulted in decreased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a,
leading to their increased stability and increased transactivation of reporter
gene expression by TCF11 and Nrf1a. In contrast, knockdown or pharmacologic
inhibition of USP7 dramatically increased ubiquitination of TCF11 and Nrf1a and
reduction of their steady state levels. Loss of USP7 function attenuated the
induction of Nrf1 protein expression in response to treatment with arsenic and
other toxic metals, and inhibition of USP7 activity significantly sensitized
cells to arsenic treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest that USP7 may
act to modulate abundance of Nrf1 protein to induce gene expression in response
to toxic metal exposure.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the deleterious lesions that are both
endogenous and exogenous in origin and are repaired by nonhomologous end joining 
or homologous recombination. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for
maintaining genome stability remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate
the role of two E3 ligases, Dma1 and Dma2 (homologs of human RNF8), in the
maintenance of genome stability in budding yeast. Using yeast spotting assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation and plasmid and chromosomal repair assays, we
establish that Dma1 and Dma2 act in a redundant and a catalysis-dependent manner 
in the maintenance of genome stability, as well as localize to transcribed
regions of the genome and increase in abundance upon phleomycin treatment. In
addition, Dma1 and Dma2 are required for the normal kinetics of histone H4
acetylation under DNA damage conditions, genetically interact with RAD9 and SAE2,
and are in a complex with Rad53 and histones. Taken together, our results
demonstrate the requirement of Dma1 and Dma2 in regulating DNA repair pathway
choice, preferentially affecting homologous recombination over nonhomologous end 
joining, and open up the possibility of using these candidates in manipulating
the repair pathways toward precision genome editing.

Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) folds and trafficks inefficiently, with only
20% of newly expressed protein trafficking to the cell surface. This behavior is 
exacerbated in many of the mutants associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,
motivating further study. Here we characterized the role of N-glycosylation in
limiting PMP22 trafficking. We first eliminated N-glycosylation using an N41Q
mutation, which resulted in an almost 3-fold increase in trafficking efficiency
of wildtype (WT) PMP22 and a 10-fold increase for the severely unstable L16P
disease mutant in HEK293 cells, with similar results in Schwann cells. Total
cellular levels were also much higher for the WT/N41Q mutant, although not for
the L16P/N41Q form. Depletion of oligosaccharyltransferase OST-A and OST-B
subunits revealed that WT PMP22 is N-glycosylated posttranslationally by OST-B,
whereas L16P is cotranslationally glycosylated by OST-A. Quantitative proteomic
screens revealed similarities and differences in the interactome for WT,
glycosylation-deficient, and unstable mutant forms of PMP22 and also suggested
that L16P is sequestered at earlier stages of endoplasmic reticulum quality
control. CRISPR knockout studies revealed a role for retention in endoplasmic
reticulum sorting receptor 1 (RER1) in limiting the trafficking of all three
forms, for UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1) in limiting the

Proper dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation are essential for neuronal
development and function. Dasm1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is
known to promote dendrite outgrowth and excitatory synapse maturation in vitro.
However, the in vivo function of Dasm1 in neuronal development and the underlying
mechanisms are not well understood. To learn more, Dasm1 knockout mice were
constructed and employed to confirm that Dasm1 regulates dendrite arborization
and spine formation in vivo. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Dasm1, 
revealing MRCKβ as a putative partner; additional lines of evidence confirmed
this interaction and identified cytoplasmic proline-rich region (823-947 aa) of
Dasm1 and MRCKβ self-activated kinase domain (CC1, 410-744 aa) as necessary and
sufficient for binding. Using co-immunoprecipitation assay, autophosphorylation
assay, and BS3 cross-linking assay, we show that Dasm1 binding triggers a change 
in MRCKβ's conformation and subsequent dimerization, resulting in
autophosphorylation and activation. Activated MRCKβ in turn phosphorylates a
class 2 regulatory myosin light chain, which leads to enhanced actin
rearrangement, causing the dendrite outgrowth and spine formation observed
before. Removal of Dasm1 in mice leads to behavioral abnormalities. Together,
these results reveal a crucial molecular pathway mediating cell surface and
intracellular signaling communication to regulate actin dynamics and neuronal
development in the mammalian brain.

Anoctamin-1 (ANO1) (TMEM16A) is a calcium-activated chloride channel that plays
critical roles in diverse physiological processes, such as sensory transduction
and epithelial secretion. ANO1 levels have been shown to be altered under
physiological and pathological conditions, although the molecular mechanisms that
control ANO1 protein levels remain unclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is
known to regulate the levels of numerous ion channels, but little information is 
available regarding whether and how ubiquitination regulates levels of ANO1.
Here, we showed that two E3 ligases, TRIM23 and TRIM21, physically interact with 
the C terminus of ANO1. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that whereas
TRIM23 ubiquitinated ANO1 leading to its stabilization, TRIM21 ubiquitinated ANO1
and induced its degradation. Notably, ANO1 regulation by TRIM23 and TRIM21 is
involved in chemical-induced pain sensation, salivary secretion, and heart-rate
control in mice, and TRIM23 also mediates ANO1 upregulation induced by epidermal 
growth factor treatment. Our results suggest that these two antagonistic E3
ligases act together to control ANO1 expression and function. Our findings reveal
a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating ANO1 protein levels and
identify a potential molecular link between ANO1 regulation, epidermal growth
factor, and other signaling pathways.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
agent of the COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host
factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new
directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone
important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking
analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that
GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the
perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells and 
that the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction.
In vitro binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the
RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we
knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell
surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein 
response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody
(hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models depleted
cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as
SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Our data suggest
that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and
infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses 
that utilize GRP78 in combination therapy.

One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the
deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau 
in the brain. Aberrant activation of kinases in AD has been suggested to enhance 
phosphorylation and toxicity of tau, making the responsible tau kinases
attractive therapeutic targets. The full complement of tau-interacting kinases in
AD brain and their activity in disease remains incompletely defined. Here,
immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) identified
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a tau-interacting partner in human AD cortical
brain tissues. We validated this interaction in human AD, familial frontotemporal
dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) caused by mutations
in MAPT (R406W & P301L) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) postmortem brain
tissues as well as human cell lines. Further, we document increased TBK1
activation in both AD and FTDP-17 and map TBK1 phosphorylation sites on tau based
on in vitro kinase assays coupled to MS. Lastly, in a Drosophila tauopathy model,
activating expression of a conserved TBK1 ortholog triggers tau
hyperphosphorylation and enhanced neurodegeneration, whereas knockdown had the
reciprocal effect, suppressing tau toxicity. Collectively, our findings suggest
that increased TBK1 activation may promote tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal 
loss in AD and related tauopathies.

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) is a potent mitogen that activates the IGF
receptor (IGFR)/insulin receptor substrate (IRS) axis, thus stimulating growth in
normal cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer. Posttranslational
modifications of IRS such as ubiquitination tightly control IGF signaling, and we
previously identified IRS-1 as a potential substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
TRAF4 using an unbiased screen. Here we provide evidence that TRAF4-mediated
ubiquitination of IRS-1 is physiologically relevant and crucial for IGF signal
transduction. Through site-directed mutagenesis we found that TRAF4 promotes an
atypical K29-linked ubiquitination at the C-terminal end of IRS-1. Its depletion 
abolishes AKT and ERK phosphorylation downstream of IGF-1 and inhibits breast
cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression of TRAF4 enhances IGF1-induced
IGFR-IRS-1 interaction, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and downstream effector
protein activation, whereas mutation of IRS-1 ubiquitination sites completely
abolishes these effects. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that nonproteolytic 
ubiquitination of IRS-1 is a key step in conveying IGF-1 stimulation from IGFR to
IRS-1.

The glycoprotein α-dystroglycan helps to link the intracellular cytoskeleton to
the extracellular matrix. A unique glycan structure attached to this protein is
required for its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin. 
Up to now, this is the only mammalian glycan known to contain ribitol phosphate
groups. Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus use CDP-ribitol to incorporate ribitol
phosphate into the glycan chain of α-dystroglycan. Since CDP-ribitol is
synthesized in the cytoplasm, we hypothesized that an unknown transporter must be
required for its import into the Golgi apparatus. We discovered that CDP-ribitol 
transport relies on the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 and the transporter
SLC35A4 in a redundant manner. These two transporters are closely related, but
bulky residues in the predicted binding pocket of SLC35A4 limit its size. We
hypothesized that the large binding pocket SLC35A1 might accommodate the bulky
CMP-sialic acid and the smaller CDP-ribitol, whereas SLC35A4 might only accept
CDP-ribitol. To test this, we expressed SLC35A1 with mutations in its binding
pocket in SLC35A1 KO cell lines. When we restricted the binding site of SLC35A1
by introducing the bulky residues present in SLC35A4, the mutant transporter was 
unable to support sialylation of proteins in cells but still supported ribitol
phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the size of the binding pocket determines
the substrate specificity of SLC35A1, allowing a variety of cytosine nucleotide
conjugates to be transported. The redundancy with SLC35A4 also explains why
patients with SLC35A1 mutations do not show symptoms of α-dystroglycan
deficiency.

The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (WWTR1) induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhances drug resistance in multiple
cancers. TAZ has been shown to interact with transcription factors in the
nucleus, but when phosphorylated, translocates to the cytoplasm and is degraded
through proteasomes. Here, we identified a compound TAZ inhibitor 4 (TI-4) that
shifted TAZ localization to the cytoplasm independently of its phosphorylation.
We used affinity beads to ascertain a putative target of TI-4, chromosomal
segregation 1 like (CSE1L), which is known to be involved in the recycling of
importin α and as a biomarker of cancer malignancy. We found that TI-4 suppressed
TAZ-mediated transcription in a CSE1L-dependent manner. CSE1L overexpression
increased nuclear levels of TAZ, whereas CSE1L silencing delayed its nuclear
import. We also found via the in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments that
TI-4 strengthened the interaction between CSE1L and importin α5 and blocked the
binding of importin α5 to TAZ. WWTR1 silencing attenuated CSE1L-promoted colony
formation, motility, and invasiveness of human lung cancer and glioblastoma
cells. Conversely, CSE1L silencing blocked TAZ-promoted colony formation,
motility, and invasiveness in human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. In human 
cancer tissues, the expression level of CSE1L was found to correlate with nuclear
levels of TAZ. These findings support that CSE1L promotes the nuclear
accumulation of TAZ and enhances malignancy in cancer cells.

After activation of G protein-coupled receptors, G protein βγ dimers may
translocate from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus (GA). We recently
report that this translocation activates extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) via PI3Kγ; however, how Gβγ-PI3Kγ activates the ERK1/2
pathway is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CXCR4 activates 
ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase important for vesicle-mediated
membrane trafficking. This activation is blocked by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout
of the GA-translocating Gγ9 subunit. Inducible targeting of different Gβγ dimers 
to the GA can directly activate ARF1. CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gβγ
recruitment to the GA also enhance ARF1 translocation to the GA. We further
demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of 
PI3Kγ markedly inhibit CXCR4-mediated and Gβγ translocation-mediated ARF1
activation. We also show that depletion of ARF1 by siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 and
inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 activation abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and
Gβγ translocation to the GA and suppress prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and
invasion. Collectively, our data reveal a novel function for Gβγ translocation to
the GA to activate ARF1 and identify GA-localized ARF1 as an effector acting
downstream of Gβγ-PI3Kγ to spatiotemporally regulate G protein-coupled receptor
signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases.

A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that mediates both inflammation and
ubiquitination in mammals, but the related mechanisms are not clear. In this
study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) screening, gene ontology (GO)
analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
inflammatory cell model to identify novel A20-interacting proteins. We confirmed 
that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, also known as ring finger protein 41 (RNF41),
interacted with A20 in LPS-stimulated cells. Further co-IP analysis demonstrated 
that when A20 was knocked out, degradation-inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of 
inflammatory effector MyD88 was decreased, but protein interaction-mediating
K63-linked ubiquitination of another inflammatory effector TBK1 was increased.
Moreover, western blot experiments showed that A20 inhibition induced an increase
in levels of MyD88 and phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins as well as
of TBK1 and a downstream effector, while Nrdp1 inhibition induced an increase in 
MyD88 but a decrease in TBK1 levels. When A20 and Nrdp1 were coinhibited, no
further change in MyD88 was observed, but TBK1 levels were significantly
decreased compared with those upon A20 inhibition alone. Gain- and
loss-of-function analyses revealed that the ZnF4 domain of A20 is required for
Nrdp1 polyubiquitination. Upon LPS stimulation, the inhibition of Nrdp1 alone
increased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α but decreased IFN-β secretion, as
observed in other studies, suggesting that Nrdp1 preferentially promotes the
production of IFN-β. Taken together, these results demonstrated that A20/Nrdp1
interaction is important for A20 anti-inflammation, thus revealing a novel
mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of A20.

Normal contractile function of the heart depends on a constant and reliable
production of ATP by cardiomyocytes. Dysregulation of cardiac energy metabolism
can result in immature heart development and disrupt the ability of the adult
myocardium to adapt to stress, potentially leading to heart failure. Further,
restoration of abnormal mitochondrial function can have beneficial effects on
cardiac dysfunction. Previously, we identified a novel protein termed Perm1
(PGC-1 and estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-induced regulator, muscle 1) that is
enriched in skeletal and cardiac-muscle mitochondria and transcriptionally
regulated by PGC-1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 
1) and ERR. The role of Perm1 in the heart is poorly understood and is studied
here. We utilized cell culture, mouse models, and human tissue, to study its
expression and transcriptional control, as well as its role in transcription of
other factors. Critically, we tested Perm1's role in cardiomyocyte mitochondrial 
function and its ability to protect myocytes from stress-induced damage. Our
studies show that Perm1 expression increases throughout mouse cardiogenesis,
demonstrate that Perm1 interacts with PGC-1α and enhances activation of PGC-1 and
ERR, increases mitochondrial DNA copy number, and augments oxidative capacity in 
cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we found that Perm1 reduced
cellular damage produced as a result of hypoxia and reoxygenation-induced stress 
and mitigated cell death of cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our results show that
Perm1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse cardiomyocytes. Future studies
can assess the potential of Perm1 to be used as a novel therapeutic to restore
cardiac dysfunction induced by ischemic injury.

Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine
methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains
unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred
PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by
immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from
cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with
lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein
interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG
substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other
components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral
response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the
formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated
suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor
domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a
dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023
significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are 
already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine
methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral
genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic 
application of these drugs.

The NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the prevention of
many age-related diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disease. Resveratrol, a plant polyphenol, exhibits antiaging, antitumor, and
vascular protection effects by activating Sirt1. However, the molecular mechanism
of Sirt1 activation as induced by resveratrol remains unclear. By
knockdown/rescue experiments, fluorometric Sirt1 activity assay,
immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, we identify here that the tumor
suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) as a direct activator of Sirt1 elicited by
resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes the binding between LKB1 and Sirt1, which we
first reported, and this binding leads to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Sirt1 
at three different serine residues in the C terminus of Sirt1. Mechanistically,
LKB1-mediated phosphorylation increases intramolecular interactions in Sirt1,
such as the binding of the C terminus to the deacetylase core domain, thereby
eliminating DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1, Sirt1 endogenous inhibitor)
inhibition and promoting Sirt1-substrate interaction. Functionally,
LKB1-dependent Sirt1 activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and
respiration through deacetylation and activation of the transcriptional
coactivator PGC-1α. These results identify Sirt1 as a context-dependent target of
LKB1 and suggest that a resveratrol-stimulated LKB1-Sirt1 pathway plays a vital
role in mitochondrial metabolism, a key physiological process that contributes to
numerous age-related diseases.

Interferon-γ-inducible factor 16 (IFI16) triggers stimulator of interferon (IFN) 
genes (STING)-dependent type I IFN production during host antiviral immunity and 
facilitates p53-dependent apoptosis during suppressing tumorigenesis. We have
previously reported that STING-mediated IFI16 degradation negatively regulates
type I IFN production. However, it is unknown whether STING also suppresses
IFI16/p53-dependent apoptosis via degradation of IFI16. Here, our results from
flow cytometry apoptosis detection and immunoblot assays show that IFI16 and
nutlin-3, a p53 pathway activator, synergistically induce apoptosis in U2OS and
A549 cells. Protein kinase R-triggered phosphorylation of p53 at serine 392 is
critical for the IFI16-p53-dependent apoptosis. However, overexpression of STING 
suppresses p53 serine 392 phosphorylation, p53 transcriptional activity,
expression of p53 target genes, and p53-dependent mitochondrial depolarization
and apoptosis. In summary, our current study demonstrates that STING-mediated
IFI16 degradation negatively regulates IFI16-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis in 
osteosarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells, which suggests a
protumorigenic role for STING in certain cancer types because of its potent
ability to degrade upstream IFI16.

The neurotrophin receptors p75 and tyrosine protein kinase receptor A (TrkA) play
important roles in the development and survival of the nervous system.
Biochemical data suggest that p75 and TrkA reciprocally regulate the activities
of each other. For instance, p75 is able to regulate the response of TrkA to
lower concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), and TrkA promotes shedding of 
the extracellular domain of p75 by α-secretases in a ligand-dependent manner. The
current model suggests that p75 and TrkA are regulated by means of a direct
physical interaction; however, the nature of such interaction has been elusive
thus far. Here, using NMR in micelles, multiscale molecular dynamics, FRET, and
functional studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction
between TrkA and p75 through their respective transmembrane domains (TMDs).
Molecular dynamics of p75-TMD mutants suggests that although the interaction
between TrkA and p75 TMDs is maintained upon mutation, a specific protein
interface is required to facilitate TrkA active homodimerization in the presence 
of NGF. The same mutations in the TMD protein interface of p75 reduced the
activation of TrkA by NGF as well as reducing cell differentiation. In summary,
we provide a structural model of the p75-TrkA receptor complex necessary for
neuronal development stabilized by TMD interactions.

Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (Sgk3) is a serine/threonine protein
kinase activated by the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)
downstream of growth factor signaling via class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling and by class III PI3K/Vps34-mediated PI3P production on
endosomes. Upregulation of Sgk3 activity has recently been linked to a number of 
human cancers; however, the precise mechanism of activation of Sgk3 is unknown.
Here, we use a wide range of cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical
techniques, including hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, to
investigate the mechanism of activation of Sgk3 by PI3P. We show that Sgk3 is
regulated by a combination of phosphorylation and allosteric activation. We
demonstrate that binding of Sgk3 to PI3P via its regulatory phox homology (PX)
domain induces large conformational changes in Sgk3 associated with its
activation and that the PI3P-binding pocket of the PX domain of Sgk3 is
sequestered in its inactive conformation. Finally, we reconstitute Sgk3
activation via Vps34-mediated PI3P synthesis on phosphatidylinositol liposomes
in vitro. In addition to identifying the mechanism of Sgk3 activation by PI3P,
our findings open up potential therapeutic avenues in allosteric inhibitor
development to target Sgk3 in cancer.

Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and DNA Ligase IIIα (LigIIIα) are key
enzymes in single-strand break (SSB) repair. TDP1 removes 3'-tyrosine residues
remaining after degradation of DNA topoisomerase (TOP) 1 cleavage complexes
trapped by either DNA lesions or TOP1 inhibitors. It is not known how TDP1 is
linked to subsequent processing and LigIIIα-catalyzed joining of the SSB. Here we
define a direct interaction between the TDP1 catalytic domain and the LigIII
DNA-binding domain (DBD) regulated by conformational changes in the unstructured 
TDP1 N-terminal region induced by phosphorylation and/or alterations in amino
acid sequence. Full-length and N-terminally truncated TDP1 are more effective at 
correcting SSB repair defects in TDP1 null cells compared with full-length TDP1
with amino acid substitutions of an N-terminal serine residue phosphorylated in
response to DNA damage. TDP1 forms a stable complex with LigIII170-755, as well
as full-length LigIIIα alone or in complex with the DNA repair scaffold protein
XRCC1. Small-angle X-ray scattering and negative stain electron microscopy
combined with mapping of the interacting regions identified a TDP1/LigIIIα
compact dimer of heterodimers in which the two LigIII catalytic cores are
positioned in the center, whereas the two TDP1 molecules are located at the edges
of the core complex flanked by highly flexible regions that can interact with
other repair proteins and SSBs. As TDP1and LigIIIα together repair adducts caused
by TOP1 cancer chemotherapy inhibitors, the defined interaction architecture and 
regulation of this enzyme complex provide insights into a key repair pathway in
nonmalignant and cancer cells.

The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is an important regulator of
cell growth, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. CREB is activated through
phosphorylation of an evolutionarily conserved Ser residue (S133) within its
intrinsically disordered kinase-inducible domain (KID). Phosphorylation of S133
in response to cAMP, Ca2+, and other stimuli triggers an association of the KID
with the KID-interacting (KIX) domain of the CREB-binding protein (CBP), a
histone acetyl transferase (HAT) that promotes transcriptional activation. Here
we addressed the mechanisms of CREB attenuation following bursts in CREB
phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation of S133 is reversed by protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is recruited to CREB through its B56 regulatory
subunits. We found that a B56-binding site located at the carboxyl-terminal
boundary of the KID (BS2) mediates high-affinity B56 binding, while a second
binding site (BS1) located near the amino terminus of the KID mediates low
affinity binding enhanced by phosphorylation of adjacent casein kinase (CK)
phosphosites. Mutations that diminished B56 binding to BS2 elevated both basal
and stimulus-induced phosphorylation of S133, increased CBP interaction with
CREB, and potentiated the expression of CREB-dependent reporter genes. Cells from
mice harboring a homozygous CrebE153D mutation that disrupts BS2 exhibited
increased S133 phosphorylation stoichiometry and elevated transcriptional bursts 
to cAMP. These findings provide insights into substrate targeting by PP2A
holoenzymes and establish a new mechanism of CREB attenuation that has
implications for understanding CREB signaling in cell growth, metabolism,
synaptic plasticity, and other physiologic contexts.

Post-translational modifications to tubulin are important for many
microtubule-based functions inside cells. It was recently shown that methylation 
of tubulin by the histone methyltransferase SETD2 occurs on mitotic spindle
microtubules during cell division, with its absence resulting in mitotic defects.
However, the catalytic mechanism of methyl addition to tubulin is unclear. We
used a truncated version of human wild type SETD2 (tSETD2) containing the
catalytic SET and C-terminal Set2-Rpb1-interacting (SRI) domains to investigate
the biochemical mechanism of tubulin methylation. We found that recombinant
tSETD2 had a higher activity toward tubulin dimers than polymerized microtubules.
Using recombinant single-isotype tubulin, we demonstrated that methylation was
restricted to lysine 40 of α-tubulin. We then introduced pathogenic mutations
into tSETD2 to probe the recognition of histone and tubulin substrates. A
mutation in the catalytic domain (R1625C) allowed tSETD2 to bind to tubulin but
not methylate it, whereas a mutation in the SRI domain (R2510H) caused loss of
both tubulin binding and methylation. Further investigation of the role of the
SRI domain in substrate binding found that mutations within this region had
differential effects on the ability of tSETD2 to bind to tubulin versus the
binding partner RNA polymerase II for methylating histones in vivo, suggesting
distinct mechanisms for tubulin and histone methylation by SETD2. Finally, we
found that substrate recognition also requires the negatively charged C-terminal 
tail of α-tubulin. Together, this study provides a framework for understanding
how SETD2 serves as a dual methyltransferase for both histone and tubulin
methylation.

Fibrosis is a pronounced feature of heart disease and the result of dysregulated 
activation of resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Recent work identified
stress-induced degradation of the cytoskeletal protein βIV-spectrin as an
important step in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, loss of
βIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII).
Therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism for CaMKII-dependent regulation
of βIV-spectrin and CF activity. Computational screening and MS revealed a
critical serine residue (S2250 in mouse and S2254 in human) in βIV-spectrin
phosphorylated by CaMKII. Disruption of βIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction or
alanine substitution of βIV-spectrin Ser2250 (βIV-S2254A) prevented
CaMKII-induced degradation, whereas a phosphomimetic construct (βIV-spectrin with
glutamic acid substitution at serine 2254 [βIV-S2254E]) showed accelerated
degradation in the absence of CaMKII. To assess the physiological significance of
this phosphorylation event, we expressed exogenous βIV-S2254A and βIV-S2254E
constructs in βIV-spectrin-deficient CFs, which have increased proliferation and 
fibrotic gene expression compared with WT CFs. βIV-S2254A but not βIV-S2254E
normalized CF proliferation, gene expression, and contractility.
Pathophysiological targeting of βIV-spectrin phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation was identified in CFs activated with the profibrotic ligand
angiotensin II, resulting in increased proliferation and signal transducer and
activation of transcription 3 nuclear accumulation. While therapeutic delivery of
exogenous WT βIV-spectrin partially reversed these trends, βIV-S2254A completely 
negated increased CF proliferation and signal transducer and activation of
transcription 3 translocation. Moreover, we observed βIV-spectrin phosphorylation
and associated loss in total protein within human heart tissue following heart
failure. Together, these data illustrate a considerable role for the
βIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction in activating profibrotic signaling.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor activated by
exogenous halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, including the
environmental toxin TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and naturally
occurring dietary and endogenous compounds. The activated AHR enhances
transcription of specific genes including phase I and phase II metabolism enzymes
and other targets genes such as the TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(TiPARP). The regulation of AHR activation is a dynamic process: immediately
after transcriptional activation of the AHR by TCDD, the AHR is exported from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is subjected to proteasomal degradation.
However, the mechanisms regulating AHR degradation are not well understood. Here,
we studied the role of two enzymes reported to enhance AHR breakdown: the cullin 
4B (CUL4B)AHR complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the AHR and other
proteins for ubiquitination, and TiPARP, which targets proteins for
ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that can increase
susceptibility to degradation. Using a WT mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell
line and an MEF cell line in which CUL4B has been deleted (MEFCul4b-null), we
discovered that loss of CUL4B partially prevented AHR degradation after TCDD
exposure, while knocking down TiPARP in MEFCul4b-null cells completely abolished 
AHR degradation upon TCDD treatment. Increased TCDD-activated AHR protein levels 
in MEFCul4b-null and MEFCul4b-null cells in which TiPARP was knocked down led to 
enhanced AHR transcriptional activity, indicating that CUL4B and TiPARP restrain 
AHR action. This study reveals a novel function of TiPARP in controlling
TCDD-activated AHR nuclear export and subsequent proteasomal degradation.

Abl family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases activated by diverse cellular
stimuli that regulate cytoskeleton organization, morphogenesis, and adhesion. The
catalytic activity of Abl family kinases is tightly regulated in cells by a
complex set of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and
post-translational modifications. For example, the platelet-derived growth factor
receptor beta (PDGFRβ), important for cell proliferation and chemotaxis, is a
potent activator of Abl family kinases. However, the molecular mechanism by which
PDGFRβ engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. We show here that
the Abl2 Src homology 2 domain directly binds to phosphotyrosine Y771 in the
PDGFRβ cytoplasmic domain. PDGFRβ directly phosphorylates multiple novel sites on
the N-terminal half of Abl2, including Y116, Y139, and Y161 within the Src
homology 3 domain, and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Y116, Y161,
Y272, and Y310 are all located at or near the Src homology 3/Src homology
2-kinase linker interface, which helps maintain Abl family kinases in an
autoinhibited conformation. We also found that PDGFRβ-mediated phosphorylation of
Abl2 in vitro activates Abl2 kinase activity, but mutation of these four
tyrosines (Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310) to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRβ-mediated
activation of Abl2. These findings reveal how PDGFRβ engages and phosphorylates
Abl2 leading to activation of the kinase, providing a framework to understand how
growth factor receptors engage and activate Abl family kinases.

Talin (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly 
couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to force, talin
undergoes switch-like behavior of its multiple rod domains that modulate
interactions with its binding partners. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) is a key
regulator of the cell cycle, exerting its effects through synchronized
phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets. CDK1 activity maintains
adhesion during interphase, and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly 
choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesion that are required for successful
mitosis. Using a combination of biochemical, structural, and cell biological
approaches, we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that
occurs at sites of integrin-mediated adhesion. Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1
contains a functional talin-binding LD motif, and the binding site within talin
was pinpointed to helical bundle R8. Talin also contains a consensus CDK1
phosphorylation motif centered on S1589, a site shown to be phosphorylated by
CDK1 in vitro. A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the
binding affinity of the cytoskeletal adaptor KANK and weakened the response of
this region to force as measured by single molecule stretching, potentially
altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways. The direct binding of the
master cell cycle regulator CDK1 to the primary integrin effector talin
represents a coupling of cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries and
thereby indicates a mechanism by which the microenvironment can control cell
division in multicellular organisms.

Phospholipase A1 (PLA1) hydrolyzes the fatty acids of glycerophospholipids, which
are structural components of the cellular membrane. Genetic mutations in DDHD1,
an intracellular PLA1, result in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in humans.
However, the regulation of DDHD1 activity has not yet been elucidated in detail. 
In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation of DDHD1 and identified the
responsible protein kinases. We performed MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis and Phos-tag
SDS-PAGE in alanine-substitution mutants in HEK293 cells and revealed multiple
phosphorylation sites in human DDHD1, primarily Ser8, Ser11, Ser723, and Ser727. 
The treatment of cells with a protein phosphatase inhibitor induced the
hyperphosphorylation of DDHD1, suggesting that multisite phosphorylation occurred
not only at these major, but also at minor sites. Site-specific kinase-substrate 
prediction algorithms and in vitro kinase analyses indicated that
cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1/cyclin A2 phosphorylated Ser8, Ser11, and Ser727 in 
DDHD1 with a preference for Ser11 and that CDK5/p35 also phosphorylated Ser11 and
Ser727 with a preference for Ser11. In addition, casein kinase CK2α1 was found to
phosphorylate Ser104, although this was not a major phosphorylation site in
cultivated HEK293 cells. The evaluation of the effects of phosphorylation
revealed that the phosphorylation mimic mutants S11/727E exhibit only 20%
reduction in PLA1 activity. However, the phosphorylation mimics were mainly
localized to focal adhesions, whereas the phosphorylation-resistant mutants
S11/727A were not. This suggested that phosphorylation alters the subcellular
localization of DDHD1 without greatly affecting its PLA1 activity.

Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine
methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains
unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred
PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by
immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from
cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with
lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein
interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG
substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other
components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral
response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the
formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated
suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor
domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a
dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023
significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are 
already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine
methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral
genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic 
application of these drugs.

The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is an important regulator of
cell growth, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. CREB is activated through
phosphorylation of an evolutionarily conserved Ser residue (S133) within its
intrinsically disordered kinase-inducible domain (KID). Phosphorylation of S133
in response to cAMP, Ca2+, and other stimuli triggers an association of the KID
with the KID-interacting (KIX) domain of the CREB-binding protein (CBP), a
histone acetyl transferase (HAT) that promotes transcriptional activation. Here
we addressed the mechanisms of CREB attenuation following bursts in CREB
phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation of S133 is reversed by protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is recruited to CREB through its B56 regulatory
subunits. We found that a B56-binding site located at the carboxyl-terminal
boundary of the KID (BS2) mediates high-affinity B56 binding, while a second
binding site (BS1) located near the amino terminus of the KID mediates low
affinity binding enhanced by phosphorylation of adjacent casein kinase (CK)
phosphosites. Mutations that diminished B56 binding to BS2 elevated both basal
and stimulus-induced phosphorylation of S133, increased CBP interaction with
CREB, and potentiated the expression of CREB-dependent reporter genes. Cells from
mice harboring a homozygous CrebE153D mutation that disrupts BS2 exhibited
increased S133 phosphorylation stoichiometry and elevated transcriptional bursts 
to cAMP. These findings provide insights into substrate targeting by PP2A
holoenzymes and establish a new mechanism of CREB attenuation that has
implications for understanding CREB signaling in cell growth, metabolism,
synaptic plasticity, and other physiologic contexts.

A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that mediates both inflammation and
ubiquitination in mammals, but the related mechanisms are not clear. In this
study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) screening, gene ontology (GO)
analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
inflammatory cell model to identify novel A20-interacting proteins. We confirmed 
that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, also known as ring finger protein 41 (RNF41),
interacted with A20 in LPS-stimulated cells. Further co-IP analysis demonstrated 
that when A20 was knocked out, degradation-inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of 
inflammatory effector MyD88 was decreased, but protein interaction-mediating
K63-linked ubiquitination of another inflammatory effector TBK1 was increased.
Moreover, western blot experiments showed that A20 inhibition induced an increase
in levels of MyD88 and phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins as well as
of TBK1 and a downstream effector, while Nrdp1 inhibition induced an increase in 
MyD88 but a decrease in TBK1 levels. When A20 and Nrdp1 were coinhibited, no
further change in MyD88 was observed, but TBK1 levels were significantly
decreased compared with those upon A20 inhibition alone. Gain- and
loss-of-function analyses revealed that the ZnF4 domain of A20 is required for
Nrdp1 polyubiquitination. Upon LPS stimulation, the inhibition of Nrdp1 alone
increased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α but decreased IFN-β secretion, as
observed in other studies, suggesting that Nrdp1 preferentially promotes the
production of IFN-β. Taken together, these results demonstrated that A20/Nrdp1
interaction is important for A20 anti-inflammation, thus revealing a novel
mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of A20.

Abl family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases activated by diverse cellular
stimuli that regulate cytoskeleton organization, morphogenesis, and adhesion. The
catalytic activity of Abl family kinases is tightly regulated in cells by a
complex set of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and
post-translational modifications. For example, the platelet-derived growth factor
receptor beta (PDGFRβ), important for cell proliferation and chemotaxis, is a
potent activator of Abl family kinases. However, the molecular mechanism by which
PDGFRβ engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. We show here that
the Abl2 Src homology 2 domain directly binds to phosphotyrosine Y771 in the
PDGFRβ cytoplasmic domain. PDGFRβ directly phosphorylates multiple novel sites on
the N-terminal half of Abl2, including Y116, Y139, and Y161 within the Src
homology 3 domain, and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Y116, Y161,
Y272, and Y310 are all located at or near the Src homology 3/Src homology
2-kinase linker interface, which helps maintain Abl family kinases in an
autoinhibited conformation. We also found that PDGFRβ-mediated phosphorylation of
Abl2 in vitro activates Abl2 kinase activity, but mutation of these four
tyrosines (Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310) to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRβ-mediated
activation of Abl2. These findings reveal how PDGFRβ engages and phosphorylates
Abl2 leading to activation of the kinase, providing a framework to understand how
growth factor receptors engage and activate Abl family kinases.

Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and DNA Ligase IIIα (LigIIIα) are key
enzymes in single-strand break (SSB) repair. TDP1 removes 3'-tyrosine residues
remaining after degradation of DNA topoisomerase (TOP) 1 cleavage complexes
trapped by either DNA lesions or TOP1 inhibitors. It is not known how TDP1 is
linked to subsequent processing and LigIIIα-catalyzed joining of the SSB. Here we
define a direct interaction between the TDP1 catalytic domain and the LigIII
DNA-binding domain (DBD) regulated by conformational changes in the unstructured 
TDP1 N-terminal region induced by phosphorylation and/or alterations in amino
acid sequence. Full-length and N-terminally truncated TDP1 are more effective at 
correcting SSB repair defects in TDP1 null cells compared with full-length TDP1
with amino acid substitutions of an N-terminal serine residue phosphorylated in
response to DNA damage. TDP1 forms a stable complex with LigIII170-755, as well
as full-length LigIIIα alone or in complex with the DNA repair scaffold protein
XRCC1. Small-angle X-ray scattering and negative stain electron microscopy
combined with mapping of the interacting regions identified a TDP1/LigIIIα
compact dimer of heterodimers in which the two LigIII catalytic cores are
positioned in the center, whereas the two TDP1 molecules are located at the edges
of the core complex flanked by highly flexible regions that can interact with
other repair proteins and SSBs. As TDP1and LigIIIα together repair adducts caused
by TOP1 cancer chemotherapy inhibitors, the defined interaction architecture and 
regulation of this enzyme complex provide insights into a key repair pathway in
nonmalignant and cancer cells.

Insulin-induced genes (INSIGs) encode endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins
that regulate intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols are oxygenated
derivatives of cholesterol, some of which orchestrate lipid metabolism via
interaction with INSIGs. Recently, it was reported that expression of activating 
transcription factor-4 (ATF4) was induced by certain oxysterols; the precise of
mechanism is unclear. Herein, we show that INSIGs mediate ATF4 upregulation upon 
interaction with oxysterol. Oxysterols that possess a high affinity for INSIG,
such as 27- and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), markedly induced the increase of
ATF4 protein when compared with other oxysterols. In addition, ATF4 upregulation 
by these oxysterols was attenuated in INSIG1/2-deficient Chinese hamster ovary
cells and recovered by either INSIG1 or INSIG2 rescue. Mechanistic studies
revealed that the binding of 25HC to INSIG is critical for increased ATF4 protein
via activation of protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase and eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2α. Knockout of INSIG1 or INSIG2 in human hepatoma 
Huh7 cells attenuated ATF4 protein upregulation, indicating that only one of the 
endogenous INSIGs, unlike overexpression of intrinsic INSIG1 or INSIG2, was
insufficient for ATF4 induction. Furthermore, ATF4 proactively upregulated the
cell death-inducible gene expression, such as Chop, Chac1, and Trb3, thereby
markedly reducing cell viability with 25HC. These findings support a model
whereby that INSIGs sense an increase in oxysterol in the endoplasmic reticulum
and induce an increase of ATF4 protein via the protein kinase RNA-activated-like 
ER kinase-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α pathway, thereby promoting 
cell death.

NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces the superoxide anion radical (O2-), which has
functions in both cell signaling and immune defense. NOX2 is a multimeric-protein
complex consisting of several protein subunits including the GTPase Rac. NOX2
uniquely facilitates an oxidative burst, which is described by initially slow O2-
production, which increases over time. The NOX2 oxidative burst is considered
critical to immune defense because it enables expedited O2- production in
response to infections. However, the mechanism of the initiation and progression 
of this oxidative burst and its implications for regulation of NOX2 have not been
clarified. In this study, we show that the NOX2 oxidative burst is a result of
autoactivation of NOX2 coupled with the redox function of Rac. NOX2
autoactivation begins when active Rac triggers NOX2 activation and the subsequent
production of O2-, which in turn activates redox-sensitive Rac. This activated
Rac further activates NOX2, amplifying the feedforward cycle and resulting in a
NOX2-mediated oxidative burst. Using mutagenesis-based kinetic and cell analyses,
we show that enzymatic activation of Rac is exclusively responsible for
production of the active Rac trigger that initiates NOX2 autoactivation, whereas 
redox-mediated Rac activation is the main driving force of NOX2 autoactivation
and contributes to generation of ∼98% of the active NOX2 in cells. The results of
this study provide insight into the regulation of NOX2 function, which could be
used to develop therapeutics to control immune responses associated with
dysregulated NOX2 oxidative bursts.

The neurotrophin receptors p75 and tyrosine protein kinase receptor A (TrkA) play
important roles in the development and survival of the nervous system.
Biochemical data suggest that p75 and TrkA reciprocally regulate the activities
of each other. For instance, p75 is able to regulate the response of TrkA to
lower concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), and TrkA promotes shedding of 
the extracellular domain of p75 by α-secretases in a ligand-dependent manner. The
current model suggests that p75 and TrkA are regulated by means of a direct
physical interaction; however, the nature of such interaction has been elusive
thus far. Here, using NMR in micelles, multiscale molecular dynamics, FRET, and
functional studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction
between TrkA and p75 through their respective transmembrane domains (TMDs).
Molecular dynamics of p75-TMD mutants suggests that although the interaction
between TrkA and p75 TMDs is maintained upon mutation, a specific protein
interface is required to facilitate TrkA active homodimerization in the presence 
of NGF. The same mutations in the TMD protein interface of p75 reduced the
activation of TrkA by NGF as well as reducing cell differentiation. In summary,
we provide a structural model of the p75-TrkA receptor complex necessary for
neuronal development stabilized by TMD interactions.

The NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the prevention of
many age-related diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disease. Resveratrol, a plant polyphenol, exhibits antiaging, antitumor, and
vascular protection effects by activating Sirt1. However, the molecular mechanism
of Sirt1 activation as induced by resveratrol remains unclear. By
knockdown/rescue experiments, fluorometric Sirt1 activity assay,
immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, we identify here that the tumor
suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) as a direct activator of Sirt1 elicited by
resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes the binding between LKB1 and Sirt1, which we
first reported, and this binding leads to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Sirt1 
at three different serine residues in the C terminus of Sirt1. Mechanistically,
LKB1-mediated phosphorylation increases intramolecular interactions in Sirt1,
such as the binding of the C terminus to the deacetylase core domain, thereby
eliminating DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1, Sirt1 endogenous inhibitor)
inhibition and promoting Sirt1-substrate interaction. Functionally,
LKB1-dependent Sirt1 activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and
respiration through deacetylation and activation of the transcriptional
coactivator PGC-1α. These results identify Sirt1 as a context-dependent target of
LKB1 and suggest that a resveratrol-stimulated LKB1-Sirt1 pathway plays a vital
role in mitochondrial metabolism, a key physiological process that contributes to
numerous age-related diseases.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to drive key cancer pathways but
the functions of majority of lncRNAs are unknown making a case for comprehensive 
functional evaluation of lncRNAs. With an aim to identify lncRNAs dysregulated in
human cancers, we analyzed the cancer patient database of lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD), which revealed an upregulated lncRNA, LINC02381 (renamed HOXC10mRNA
stabilizing factor or HMS in this study), whose depletion results in
proliferation defects and inhibition of colony formation of human cancer cells.
In order to identify the binding targets of HMS, we screened for cis-genes and
discovered that HOXC10, an oncogene, is downregulated in the absence of HMS.
Depletion of HMS does not affect the HOXC10 promoter activity but inhibits the
HOXC10 3'-UTR-linked luciferase reporter activity. Since lncRNAs have been known 
to associate with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to stabilize mRNA transcripts, we
screened for different RBPs and discovered that HuR, an ELAV family protein,
stabilizes HOXC10 mRNA. Using RNA pull-down and deletion mapping experiments, we 
show that HuR physically interacts with the cytosine-rich stretch of HMS and
HOXC10 3'-UTR to stabilize HOXC10 mRNA. HOXC10 is overexpressed in many human
cancers, and our discovery highlights that lncRNA HMS sustains the HOXC10 mRNA
levels to maintain the invasive phenotypes of cancer cells.

Apart from prevention using vaccinations, the management options for COVID-19
remain limited. In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific
oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced
risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case
series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom
resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations
remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays 
that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity.
However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected 
Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced
expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can
reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3
and the NF-κB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory
responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced 
expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the
cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with
COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach
concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors
expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain
how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and
cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.

The Hippo pathway is a key regulatory pathway that is tightly regulated by
mechanical cues such as tension, pressure, and contact with the extracellular
matrix and other cells. At the distal end of the pathway is the yes-associated
protein (YAP), a well-characterized transcriptional regulator. Through binding to
transcription factors such as the TEA Domain TFs (TEADs) YAP regulates expression
of several genes involved in cell fate, proliferation and death decisions. While 
the function of YAP as direct transcriptional regulator has been extensively
characterized, only a small number of studies examined YAP function as a
regulator of gene expression via microRNAs. We utilized bioinformatic approaches,
including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-Seq, to identify
potential new targets of YAP regulation and identified miR-30a as a YAP target
gene in Schwann cells. We find that YAP binds to the promoter and regulates the
expression of miR-30a. Moreover, we identify several YAP-regulated genes that are
putative miR-30a targets and focus on two of these, protein tyrosine pohosphatase
non-receptor type 13 (PTPN13) and Kruppel like factor 9. We find that YAP
regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and death is mediated, to a significant 
extent, through miR-30a regulation of PTPN13 in Schwann cells. These findings
identify a new regulatory function by YAP, mediated by miR-30a, to downregulate
expression of PTPN13 and Kruppel like factor 9. These studies expand our
understanding of YAP function as a regulator of miRNAs and illustrate the
complexity of YAP transcriptional functions.

Radial migration during cortical development is required for formation of the
six-layered structure of the mammalian cortex. Defective migration of neurons is 
linked to several developmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. A
unique swollen structure called the dilation is formed in migrating neurons and
is required for movement of the centrosome and nucleus. However, the detailed
molecular mechanism by which this dilation forms is unclear. We report that
CAMDI, a gene whose deletion is associated with psychiatric behavior, is degraded
by cell division cycle protein 20 (Cdc20)-anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome
(APC/C) cell-cycle machinery after centrosome migration into the dilation in
mouse brain development. We also show that CAMDI is restabilized in the dilation 
until the centrosome enters the dilation, at which point it is once again
immediately destabilized. CAMDI degradation is carried out by binding to
Cdc20-APC/C via the destruction box degron of CAMDI. CAMDI destruction box mutant
overexpression inhibits dilation formation and neuronal cell migration via
maintaining the stabilized state of CAMDI. These results indicate that CAMDI is a
substrate of the Cdc20-APC/C system and that the oscillatory regulation of CAMDI 
protein correlates with dilation formation for proper cortical migration.

Ras-association domain family (RASSF) proteins are encoded by numerous tumor
suppressor genes that frequently become silenced in human cancers. RASSF10 is
downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in cancers and has been shown to
inhibit cell proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism(s) remains poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that RASSF10 inhibits
Cdk1/cyclin-B kinase complex formation to maintain stable levels of cyclin-B for 
inducing mitotic arrest during cell cycle. Using LC-MS/MS, live cell imaging, and
biochemical approaches, we identify Nucleophosmin (NPM) as a novel functional
target of RASSF10 and revealed that RASSF10 expression promoted the nuclear
accumulation of GADD45a and knockdown of either NPM or GADD45a, resulting in
impairment of RASSF10-mediated G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that RASSF10 is a substrate for the E3 ligase ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) and
show that an NPM-dependent downregulation of RNF2 expression is critical to
maintain stable RASSF10 levels in cells for efficient mitotic arrest.
Interestingly, the Kaplan-Meier plot analysis shows a positive correlation of
RASSF10 and NPM expression with greater gastric cancer patient survival and the
reverse with expression of RNF2, suggesting that they may have a role in cancer
progression. Finally, our findings provide insights into the mode of action of
the RASSF10/NPM/RNF2 signaling cascade on controlling cell proliferation and may 
represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the prevention of gastric cancer
metastasis.

Transcription factors (TFs) harboring broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac
(BTB) domains play important roles in development and disease. These BTB domains 
are thought to recruit transcriptional modulators to target DNA regions. However,
a systematic molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of this TF family
is lacking. Here, we identify the zinc finger BTB-TF Zbtb2 from a genetic screen 
for regulators of exit from pluripotency and demonstrate that its absence
perturbs embryonic stem cell differentiation and the gene expression dynamics
underlying peri-implantation development. We show that ZBTB2 binds the chromatin 
remodeler Ep400 to mediate downstream transcription. Independently, the BTB
domain directly interacts with nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase and histone 
chaperone histone regulator A. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase recruitment 
is a common feature of BTB TFs, and based on phylogenetic analysis, we propose
that this is a conserved evolutionary property. Binding to UBN2, in contrast, is 
specific to ZBTB2 and requires a C-terminal extension of the BTB domain. Taken
together, this study identifies a BTB-domain TF that recruits chromatin modifiers
and a histone chaperone during a developmental cell state transition and defines 
unique and shared molecular functions of the BTB-domain TF family.

signaling to Akt.

TBK1 responds to microbes to initiate cellular responses critical for host innate
immune defense. We found previously that TBK1 phosphorylates mTOR (mechanistic
target of rapamycin) on S2159 to increase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in
response to the growth factor EGF and the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(I:C). mTORC1
and the less well studied mTORC2 respond to diverse cues to control cellular
metabolism, proliferation, and survival. Although TBK1 has been linked to Akt
phosphorylation, a direct relationship between TBK1 and mTORC2, an Akt kinase,
has not been described. By studying MEFs lacking TBK1, as well as MEFs,
macrophages, and mice bearing an Mtor S2159A knock-in allele (MtorA/A) using
in vitro kinase assays and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate here that TBK1
activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) directly to increase Akt phosphorylation. We
find that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promotes mTOR-dependent
phosphorylation of Akt in response to several growth factors and poly(I:C).
Mechanistically, TBK1 coimmunoprecipitates with mTORC2 and phosphorylates mTOR
S2159 within mTORC2 in cells. Kinase assays demonstrate that TBK1 and mTOR S2159 
phosphorylation increase mTORC2 intrinsic catalytic activity. Growth factors
failed to activate TBK1 or increase mTOR S2159 phosphorylation in MEFs. Thus,
basal TBK1 activity cooperates with growth factors in parallel to increase mTORC2
(and mTORC1) signaling. Collectively, these results reveal cross talk between
TBK1 and mTOR, key regulatory nodes within two major signaling networks. As TBK1 
and mTOR contribute to tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders, these kinases may
work together in a direct manner in a variety of physiological and pathological
settings.

The cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) are well established as regulators of
blood pressure and fluid volume, but they also stimulate adipocyte lipolysis and 
control the gene program of nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue.
The NP "clearance" receptor C (NPRC) functions to clear NPs from the circulation 
via peptide internalization and degradation and thus is an important regulator of
NP signaling and adipocyte metabolism. It is well known that the Nprc gene is
highly expressed in adipose tissue and dynamically regulated upon nutrition and
environmental changes. However, the molecular basis for how Nprc gene expression 
is regulated is still poorly understood. Here, we identified the nuclear receptor
transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as 
a transcriptional regulator of Nprc expression in mouse adipocytes. During 3T3-L1
adipocyte differentiation, levels of Nprc expression increase in parallel with
PPARγ induction. Rosiglitazone, a classic PPARγ agonist, increases, whereas siRNA
knockdown of PPARγ reduces, Nprc expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By using
chromosome conformation capture and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate
that PPARγ controls Nprc gene expression in adipocytes through its long-range
distal enhancers. Furthermore, the induction of Nprc expression in adipose tissue
during high-fat diet feeding is found to be associated with increased PPARγ
enhancer activity. Our findings define PPARγ as a mediator of adipocyte Nprc gene
expression and establish a new connection between PPARγ and the control of
adipocyte NP signaling in obesity.

Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is the major component of extracellular matrix microfibrils,
which are required for proper development of elastic tissues, including the heart
and lungs. Through protein-protein interactions with latent transforming growth
factor (TGF) β-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), microfibrils regulate TGF-β signaling. 
Mutations within the 47 epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of FBN1 cause 
autosomal dominant disorders including Marfan Syndrome, which is characterized by
disrupted TGF-β signaling. We recently identified two novel protein
O-glucosyltransferases, Protein O-glucosyltransferase 2 (POGLUT2) and 3
(POGLUT3), that modify a small fraction of EGF repeats on Notch. Here, using mass
spectral analysis, we show that POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 also modify over half of the 
EGF repeats on FBN1, fibrillin-2 (FBN2), and LTBP1. While most sites are modified
by both enzymes, some sites show a preference for either POGLUT2 or POGLUT3.
POGLUT2 and POGLUT3 are homologs of POGLUT1, which stabilizes Notch proteins by
addition of O-glucose to Notch EGF repeats. Like POGLUT1, POGLUT2 and 3 can
discern a folded versus unfolded EGF repeat, suggesting POGLUT2 and 3 are
involved in a protein folding pathway. In vitro secretion assays using the
N-terminal portion of recombinant FBN1 revealed reduced FBN1 secretion in POGLUT2
knockout, POGLUT3 knockout, and POGLUT2 and 3 double-knockout HEK293T cells
compared with wild type. These results illustrate that POGLUT2 and 3 function
together to O-glucosylate protein substrates and that these modifications play a 
role in the secretion of substrate proteins. It will be interesting to see how
disease variants in these proteins affect their O-glucosylation.

Phosphorylation (activation) and dephosphorylation (deactivation) of the slit
diaphragm proteins NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are critical for maintaining the kidney
epithelial podocyte actin cytoskeleton and, therefore, proper glomerular
filtration. However, the mechanisms underlying these events remain largely
unknown. Here we show that NEPHRIN and NEPH1 are novel receptor proteins for
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and can be phosphorylated independently of the
mesenchymal epithelial transition receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion through 
engagement of their extracellular domains by HGF. Furthermore, we demonstrate SH2
domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2-dependent dephosphorylation of
these proteins. To establish HGF as a ligand, purified baculovirus-expressed
NEPHRIN and NEPH1 recombinant proteins were used in surface plasma resonance
binding experiments. We report high-affinity interactions of NEPHRIN and NEPH1
with HGF, although NEPHRIN binding was 20-fold higher than that of NEPH1. In
addition, using molecular modeling we constructed peptides that were used to map 
specific HGF-binding regions in the extracellular domains of NEPHRIN and NEPH1.
Finally, using an in vitro model of cultured podocytes and an ex vivo model of
Drosophila nephrocytes, as well as chemically induced injury models, we
demonstrated that HGF-induced phosphorylation of NEPHRIN and NEPH1 is centrally
involved in podocyte repair. Taken together, this is the first study
demonstrating a receptor-based function for NEPHRIN and NEPH1. This has important
biological and clinical implications for the repair of injured podocytes and the 
maintenance of podocyte integrity.

Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family
of kinases and shares a highly conserved kinase domain with other
mitogen-activated protein kinase family members. The activation of NLK
contributes to the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), reducing c-myb 
expression and mechanistic target of rapamycin activity, and is therefore a
potential therapeutic target. Unlike other anemias, the hematopoietic effects of 
DBA are largely restricted to the erythroid lineage. Mutations in ribosomal genes
induce ribosomal insufficiency and reduced protein translation, dramatically
impacting early erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of patients with DBA. We sought
to identify compounds that suppress NLK and increases erythropoiesis in ribosomal
insufficiency. We report that the active component of ginseng, ginsenoside Rb1,
suppresses NLK expression and improves erythropoiesis in in vitro models of DBA. 
Ginsenoside Rb1-mediated suppression of NLK occurs through the upregulation of
miR-208, which binds to the 3'-UTR of NLK mRNA and targets it for degradation. We
also compare ginsenoside Rb1-mediated upregulation of miR-208 with
metformin-mediated upregulation of miR-26. We conclude that targeting NLK
expression through miRNA binding of the unique 3'-UTR is a viable alternative to 
the challenges of developing small-molecule inhibitors to target the highly
conserved kinase domain of this specific kinase.

Cytokinesis, the final step of mitosis, is mediated by an actomyosin contractile 
ring, the formation of which is temporally and spatially regulated following
anaphase onset. Aurora-B is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, which 
regulates various processes during mitosis; it is not understood, however, how
Aurora-B is involved in cytokinesis. Here, we show that Aurora-B and myosin-IIB
form a complex in vivo during telophase. Aurora-B phosphorylates the myosin-IIB
rod domain at threonine 1847 (T1847), abrogating the ability of myosin-IIB
monomers to form filaments. Furthermore, phosphorylation of myosin-IIB filaments 
by Aurora-B also promotes filament disassembly. We show that myosin-IIB
possessing a phosphomimetic mutation at T1847 was unable to rescue cytokinesis
failure caused by myosin-IIB depletion. Cells expressing a phosphoresistant
mutation at T1847 had significantly longer intercellular bridges, implying that
Aurora-B-mediated phosphorylation of myosin-IIB is important for abscission. We
propose that myosin-IIB is a substrate of Aurora-B and reveal a new mechanism of 
myosin-IIB regulation by Aurora-B in the late stages of mitosis.

Multifunctionality of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1)
comprising antiproteolytic as well as cytokinic activity has been attributed to
its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. The molecular basis of the
emerging proinflammatory cytokinic activity of TIMP-1 is still not completely
understood. The cytokine receptor invariant chain (CD74) is involved in many
inflammation-associated diseases and is highly expressed by immune cells. CD74
triggers zeta chain-associated protein kinase-70 (ZAP-70) signaling-associated
activation upon interaction with its only known ligand, the macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor. Here, we demonstrate TIMP-1-CD74 interaction by
coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy in cells engineered to overexpress 
CD74. In silico docking in HADDOCK predicted regions of the N-terminal domain of 
TIMP-1 (N-TIMP-1) to interact with CD74. This was experimentally confirmed by
confocal microscopy demonstrating that recombinant N-TIMP-1 lacking the entire
C-terminal domain was sufficient to bind CD74. Interaction of TIMP-1 with
endogenously expressed CD74 was demonstrated in the Namalwa B lymphoma cell line 
by dot blot binding assays as well as confocal microscopy. Functionally, we
demonstrated that TIMP-1-CD74 interaction triggered intracellular ZAP-70
activation. N-TIMP-1 was sufficient to induce ZAP-70 activation and interference 
with the cytokine-binding site of CD74 using a synthetic peptide-abrogated
TIMP-1-mediated ZAP-70 activation. Altogether, we here identified CD74 as a
receptor and mediator of cytokinic TIMP-1 activity and revealed TIMP-1 as
moonlighting protein harboring both cytokinic and antiproteolytic activity within
its N-terminal domain. Recognition of this functional TIMP-1-CD74 interaction may
shed new light on clinical attempts to therapeutically target ligand-induced CD74
activity in cancer and other inflammatory diseases.

The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein is a
key player in tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was
recently found to be inactivated by tripartite motif containing 25
(TRIM25)-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, the deubiquitinase
(Dub) coordinate TRIM25 in PTEN ubiquitination is still elusive. In the present
study, we found that this K63-linked polyubiquitination could be ablated by the
ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) in a screen against a panel of Dubs. We
found using coimmununoprecipitation/immunoblotting that USP10 interacted with
PTEN and reduced the K63-linked polyubiquitination of PTEN mediated by TRIM25 in 
NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10, but not its inactive C424A deubiquitinating mutant 
or other Dubs, abolished PTEN from K63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by
TRIM25. In contrast to TRIM25, USP10 restored PTEN phosphatase activity and
reduced the production of the secondary messenger
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, thereby inhibiting AKT/mammalian target
of rapamycin progrowth signaling transduction in NSCLC cells. Moreover, USP10 was
downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and primary tissues, whereas TRIM25 was
upregulated. Consistent with its molecular activity, re-expression of USP10
suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockout of USP10
promoted NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the present study
demonstrates that USP10 coordinates TRIM25 to modulate PTEN activity.
Specifically, USP10 activates PTEN by preventing its K63-linked
polyubiquitination mediated by TRIM25 and suppresses the AKT/mammalian target of 
rapamycin signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting NSCLC proliferation, indicating
that it may be a potential drug target for cancer treatment.

Mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism are essential for regulating the
inflammatory state of monocytes. This state is partially controlled by peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a coactivator
that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Disruption of
these processes can also contribute to the initiation of chronic inflammatory
diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-dependent N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation 
has recently been shown to regulate a variety of inflammatory processes. However,
the role of m6A mRNA methylation in affecting mitochondrial metabolism in
monocytes under inflammation is unclear, nor is there an established relationship
between m6A methylation and PGC-1α. In this study, we identified a novel
mechanism by which METTL3 acts during oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(oxLDL)-induced monocyte inflammation, where METTL3 and YTH N6-methyladenosine
RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) cooperatively modify PGC-1α mRNA, mediating its
degradation, decreasing PGC-1α protein levels, and thereby enhancing the
inflammatory response. METTL3 coordinated with YTHDF2 to suppress the expression 
of PGC-1α, as well as that of cytochrome c (CYCS) and NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase subunit C2 (NDUFC2) and reduced ATP production and oxygen
consumption rate (OCR). This subsequently increased the accumulation of cellular 
and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the levels of proinflammatory
cytokines in inflammatory monocytes. These data may provide new insights into the
role of METTL3-dependent m6A modification of PGC-1α mRNA in the monocyte
inflammation response. These data also contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of the pathogenesis of monocyte-macrophage inflammation-associated 
diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Protein acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification, which is
regulated by lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and lysine deacetyltransferase
(KDAC). Although protein acetylation has been shown to regulate synaptic
plasticity, this was mainly for histone protein acetylation. The function and
regulation of nonhistone protein acetylation in synaptic plasticity and learning 
remain largely unknown. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor, plays
critical roles in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP).
During LTP induction, activation of NMDA receptor triggers Ca2+ influx, and the
Ca2+ binds with CaM and activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα
(CaMKIIα). In our previous study, we demonstrated that acetylation of CaM was
important for synaptic plasticity and fear learning in mice. However, the KAT
responsible for CaM acetylation is currently unknown. Here, following an HEK293
cell-based screen of candidate KATs, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is
identified as the most active KAT for CaM. We further demonstrate that SRC3
interacts with and acetylates CaM in a Ca2+ and NMDA receptor-dependent manner.
We also show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic downregulation of SRC3
impairs CaM acetylation, synaptic plasticity, and contextual fear learning in
mice. Moreover, the effects of SRC3 inhibition on synaptic plasticity and fear
learning could be rescued by 3KQ-CaM, a mutant form of CaM, which mimics
acetylation. Together, these observations demonstrate that SRC3 acetylates CaM
and regulates synaptic plasticity and learning in mice.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) is a nuclear receptor
transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of
metabolism, inflammation, and cancer. In addition, the nutrient-sensing kinase
5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of cellular energy 
in coordination with PPARδ. However, the molecular mechanism of the AMPK/PPARδ
pathway on cancer progression is still unclear. Here, we found that activated
AMPK induced PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation in cancer cells, whereas the PPARδ/S50A
(nonphosphorylation mimic) mutant reversed this event. Further analysis showed
that the PPARδ/S50E (phosphorylation mimic) but not the PPARδ/S50A mutant
increased PPARδ protein stability, which led to reduced p62/SQSTM1-mediated
degradation of misfolded PPARδ. Furthermore, PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation decreased 
PPARδ transcription activity and alleviated PPARδ-mediated uptake of glucose and 
glutamine in cancer cells. Soft agar and xenograft tumor model analysis showed
that the PPARδ/S50E mutant but not the PPARδ/S50A mutant inhibited colon cancer
cell proliferation and tumor growth, which was associated with inhibition of
Glut1 and SLC1A5 transporter protein expression. These findings reveal a new
mechanism of AMPK-induced PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation, accumulation of misfolded
PPARδ protein, and inhibition of PPARδ transcription activity contributing to the
suppression of colon tumor formation.

One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic
counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene. 
Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist,
suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV
ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that
SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b
gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of
approximately 17,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identify a natural variant in which a
longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two 
patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to
suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the
poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients but also describe the emergence of 
natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with an extended ORF3b gene that may potentially 
affect COVID-19 pathogenesis.

The glyoxalase system is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed enzyme
system, which is responsible for the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a
spontaneous by-product of energy metabolism. This study is able to show that a
phosphorylation of threonine-107 (T107) in the (rate-limiting) Glyoxalase 1
(Glo1) protein, mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta (CamKIIδ), 
is associated with elevated catalytic efficiency of Glo1 (lower KM; higher Vmax).
Additionally, we observe proteasomal degradation of non-phosphorylated Glo1 via
ubiquitination does occur more rapidly as compared with native Glo1. The absence 
of CamKIIδ is associated with poor detoxification capacity and decreased protein 
content of Glo1 in a murine CamKIIδ knockout model. Therefore, phosphorylation of
T107 in the Glo1 protein by CamKIIδ is a quick and precise mechanism regulating
Glo1 activity, which is experimentally linked to an altered Glo1 status in
cancer, diabetes, and during aging.

Hemopexin (Hx) is a scavenger of labile heme. Herein, we present data defining
the role of tumor stroma-expressed Hx in suppressing cancer progression. Labile
heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with
prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies
characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to
relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an
orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in
mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and
modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4)
DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated
gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Collectively, these
results reveal that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme-driven
tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/or
arrest cancer dissemination.

FAM46C is a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase uniquely mutated in up to 20% of
multiple myeloma (MM) patients, implying a tissue-specific tumor suppressor
function. Here, we report that FAM46C selectively stabilizes mRNAs encoding
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted proteins, thereby concertedly enhancing the
expression of proteins that control ER protein import, folding, N-glycosylation, 
and trafficking and boosting protein secretion. This role requires the
interaction with the ER membrane resident proteins FNDC3A and FNDC3B. In MM
cells, FAM46C expression raises secretory capacity beyond sustainability,
inducing ROS accumulation, ATP shortage, and cell death. FAM46C activity is
regulated through rapid proteasomal degradation or the inhibitory interaction
with the ZZ domain of the autophagic receptor p62 that hinders its association
with FNDC3 proteins via sequestration in p62+ aggregates. Altogether, our data
disclose a p62/FAM46C/FNDC3 circuit coordinating sustainable secretory activity
and survival, providing an explanation for the MM-specific oncosuppressive role
of FAM46C and uncovering potential therapeutic opportunities against cancer.

To explore the mechanism of Rab5/RAB-5 activation during endocytic recycling, we 
perform a genome-wide RNAi screen and identify a recycling regulator,
LET-502/ROCK. LET-502 preferentially interacts with RAB-5(GDP) and activates
RABX-5 GEF activity toward RAB-5, presumably by disrupting the self-inhibiting
conformation of RABX-5. Furthermore, we find that the concomitant loss of LET-502
and another CED-10 effector, TBC-2/RAB-5-GAP, results in an endosomal buildup of 
RAB-5, indicating that CED-10 directs TBC-2-mediated RAB-5 inactivation and
re-activates RAB-5 via LET-502 afterward. Then, we compare the functional
position of LET-502 with that of RME-6/RAB-5-GEF. Loss of LET-502-RABX-5 module
or RME-6 leads to diminished RAB-5 presence in spatially distinct endosome
groups. We conclude that in the intestine of C. elegans, RAB-5 resides in
discrete endosome subpopulations. Under the oversight of CED-10, LET-502
synergizes with RABX-5 to revitalize RAB-5 on a subset of endosomes in the deep
cytosol, ensuring the progress of basolateral recycling.

Nuclear actin has been elusive due to the lack of knowledge about molecular
mechanisms. From actin-containing chromatin remodeling complexes, we discovered
an arginine mono-methylation mark on an evolutionarily conserved R256 residue of 
actin (R256me1). Actin R256 mutations in yeast affect nuclear functions and cause
diseases in human. Interestingly, we show that an antibody specific for actin
R256me1 preferentially stains nuclear actin over cytoplasmic actin in yeast,
mouse, and human cells. We also show that actin R256me1 is regulated by protein
arginine methyl transferase-5 (PRMT5) in HEK293 cells. A genome-wide survey of
actin R256me1 mark provides a landscape for nuclear actin correlated with
transcription. Further, gene expression and protein interaction studies uncover
extensive correlations between actin R256me1 and active transcription. The
discovery of actin R256me1 mark suggests a fundamental mechanism to distinguish
nuclear actin from cytoplasmic actin through post-translational modification
(PTM) and potentially implicates an actin PTM mark in transcription and human
diseases.

Kinetochores are macromolecular protein assemblies at centromeres that mediate
accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The outer kinetochore
KNL1SPC105, MIS12MTW1, and NDC80NDC80 complexes assemble the KMN network, which
harbors the sites of microtubule binding and spindle assembly checkpoint
signaling. The buildup of the KMN network that transmits microtubule pulling
forces to budding yeast point centromeres is poorly understood. Here, we identify
225 inter-protein crosslinks by mass spectrometry on KMN complexes isolated from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae that delineate the KMN subunit connectivity for outer
kinetochore assembly. C-Terminal motifs of Nsl1 and Mtw1 recruit the SPC105
complex through Kre28, and both motifs aid tethering of the NDC80 complex by the 
previously reported Dsn1 C terminus. We show that a hub of three C-terminal MTW1 
subunit motifs mediates the cooperative stabilization of the KMN network, which
is augmented by a direct NDC80-SPC105 association.

Uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors induces leukemia. To
self-renew, leukemia cells must continuously activate genes that were previously 
active in their mother cells. Here, we describe the circuitry of a
transactivation system responsible for oncogenic self-renewal. MLL recruits RNA
polymerase II (RNAP2) to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters by its CXXC domain and
activates transcription by transcriptional regulators, including the AF4
family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex, DOT1L, and p300/CBP histone acetyl
transferases. MOZ also targets a broad range of CpG-rich promoters through
association with RNAP2 and MLL. Leukemic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and
MLL-AFX constitutively activate CpG-rich promoters by aberrantly recruiting
p300/CBP. Pharmacological inhibition of MLL or DOT1L induces differentiation of
MOZ-TIF2-transformed cells. These results reveal that activation of unmethylated 
CpG-rich promoters mediated by MLL is the central mechanism of oncogenic
self-renewal in MOZ-rearranged leukemia and indicate that the molecularly
targeted therapies intended for MLL-rearranged leukemia can be applied for
MOZ-rearranged leukemia.

The Mediator complex relays regulatory signals from gene-specific transcription
factors to the basal transcriptional machinery. However, the role of individual
Mediator subunits in different tissues remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that
MED19 is essential for adipogenesis and maintenance of white adipose tissue (WAT)
by mediating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)
transcriptional activity. MED19 knockdown blocks white adipogenesis, but not
brown adipogenesis or C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Adipose-specific MED19
knockout (KO) in mice results in a striking loss of WAT, whitening of brown fat, 
hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Inducible adipose-specific MED19 KO in
adult animals also results in lipodystrophy, demonstrating its requirement for
WAT maintenance. Global gene expression analysis reveals induction of genes
involved in apoptosis and inflammation and impaired expression of
adipose-specific genes, resulting from decreased PPARγ residency on adipocyte
gene promoters and reduced association of PPARγ with RNA polymerase II. These
results identify MED19 as a crucial facilitator of PPARγ-mediated gene expression
in adipose tissue.

mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and a master regulator of cell growth and
proliferation. Raptor, a scaffolding protein that recruits substrates to mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1), is known to be phosphorylated during mitosis, but the
significance of this phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that
raptor expression and mTORC1 activity are dramatically reduced in cells arrested 
in mitosis. Expression of a non-phosphorylatable raptor mutant reactivates mTORC1
and significantly reduces cytotoxicity of the mitotic poison Taxol. This effect
is mediated via degradation of PDCD4, a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits
eIF4A activity and is negatively regulated by the mTORC1/S6K pathway. Moreover,
pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A is able to enhance the effects of Taxol and
restore sensitivity in Taxol-resistant cancer cells. These findings indicate that
the mTORC1/S6K/PDCD4/eIF4A axis has a pivotal role in the death versus slippage
decision during mitotic arrest and may be exploited clinically to treat tumors
resistant to anti-mitotic agents.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and host
immune response determine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but studies
evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here, we use unbiased
screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type I interferon
(IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that antagonize IFN-I production via
distinct mechanisms: nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1
(TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nsp13
binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation, and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds
importin Karyopherin α 2 (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We
identify two sets of viral proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling through
blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2
phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6
suppress IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a
SARS-CoV-2 replicon replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons
containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study provides
insights on SARS-CoV-2 evasion of IFN-I response and its potential impact on
viral transmission and pathogenesis.

Despite the important roles of protein kinase Cε (PKCε) and transient receptor
potential vanilloind 1 (TRPV1) in inflammatory hypersensitivity, how PKCε is
involved in the regulation of thermal hyperalgesia is not fully understood. We
report here that PKCε is SUMOylated at a C-terminal lysine residue (K534), which 
enhances the sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel. We demonstrate that PKCε
phosphorylation promotes its SUMOylation, which in turn regulates the
phosphorylation level of TRPV1 serine 800 residue via controlling the binding of 
PKCε and TRPV1 and increased PKCε kinase activity. More importantly, the reduced 
ability of PKCε knockdown mice to develop inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia was
rescued by viral infection of lumbar 4/5 dorsal root ganglia neurons of wild-type
PKCε, but not the SUMOylation-deficient PKCε mutant. Therefore, the SUMOylation
of PKCε potentiates inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia through stabilizing the
interaction with TRPV1 to enhance its function by phosphorylation.

Here, we ask how neural stem cells (NSCs) transition in the developing neocortex 
from a rapidly to a slowly proliferating state, a process required to maintain
lifelong stem cell pools. We identify LRIG1, known to regulate receptor tyrosine 
kinase signaling in other cell types, as a negative regulator of cortical NSC
proliferation. LRIG1 is expressed in murine cortical NSCs as they start to
proliferate more slowly during embryogenesis and then peaks postnatally when they
transition to give rise to a portion of adult NSCs. Constitutive or acute loss of
Lrig1 in NSCs over this developmental time frame causes stem cell expansion due
to increased proliferation. LRIG1 controls NSC proliferation by associating with 
and negatively regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These data
support a model in which LRIG1 dampens the stem cell response to EGFR ligands
within the cortical environment to slow their proliferation as they transition to
postnatal adult NSCs.

Current models of mRNA turnover indicate that cytoplasmic degradation is coupled 
with translation. However, our understanding of the molecular events that
coordinate ribosome transit with the mRNA decay machinery is still limited. Here,
we show that 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes trigger co-translational mRNA decay. Human
cells lacking these proteins accumulate mRNAs with prominent ribosome pausing.
They include, among others, transcripts encoding secretory and membrane-bound
proteins or tubulin subunits. In addition, 4EHP-GIGYF1/2 complexes fail to reduce
mRNA levels in the absence of ribosome stalling or upon disruption of their
interaction with the cap structure, DDX6, and ZNF598. We further find that
co-translational binding of GIGYF1/2 to the mRNA marks transcripts with perturbed
elongation to decay. Our studies reveal how a repressor complex linked to
neurological disorders minimizes the protein output of a subset of mRNAs.

While plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to potentiate cellular
migration via proteolytic regulation, this adipokine is implicated as an
oncogenic ligand in the tumor microenvironment. To understand the underlying
paracrine mechanism, here, we conduct transcriptomic analysis of 1,898
endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) exposed and unexposed to PAI-1-secreting
adipose stromal cells. The PAI-1-dependent action deregulates crosstalk among
tumor-promoting and tumor-repressing pathways, including transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β). When PAI-1 is tethered to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 
1 (LRP1), the internalized signaling causes downregulation of SMAD4 at the
transcriptional and post-translational levels that attenuates TGF-β-related
transcription programs. Repression of genes encoding the junction and adhesion
complex preferentially occurs in SMAD4-underexpressed EECs of persons with
obesity. The findings highlight a role of PAI-1 signaling that renders
ineffective intercellular communication for the development of
adiposity-associated endometrial cancer.

Hhex encodes a homeobox transcriptional regulator important for embryonic
development and hematopoiesis. Hhex is highly expressed in NK cells, and its
germline deletion results in significant defects in lymphoid development,
including NK cells. To determine if Hhex is intrinsically required throughout NK 
cell development or for NK cell function, we generate mice that specifically lack
Hhex in NK cells. NK cell frequency is dramatically reduced, while NK cell
differentiation, IL-15 responsiveness, and function at the cellular level remain 
largely normal in the absence of Hhex. Increased IL-15 availability fails to
fully reverse NK lymphopenia following conditional Hhex deletion, suggesting that
Hhex regulates developmental pathways extrinsic to those dependent on IL-15. Gene
expression and functional genetic approaches reveal that Hhex regulates NK cell
survival by directly binding Bcl2l11 (Bim) and repressing expression of this key 
apoptotic mediator. These data implicate Hhex as a transcriptional regulator of
NK cell homeostasis and immunity.

TMEM18 is the strongest candidate for childhood obesity identified from GWASs,
yet as for most GWAS-derived obesity-susceptibility genes, the functional
mechanism remains elusive. We here investigate the relevance of TMEM18 for
adipose tissue development and obesity. We demonstrate that adipocyte TMEM18
expression is downregulated in children with obesity. Functionally,
downregulation of TMEM18 impairs adipocyte formation in zebrafish and in human
preadipocytes, indicating that TMEM18 is important for adipocyte differentiation 
in vivo and in vitro. On the molecular level, TMEM18 activates PPARG,
particularly upregulating PPARG1 promoter activity, and this activation is
repressed by inflammatory stimuli. The relationship between TMEM18 and PPARG1 is 
also evident in adipocytes of children and is clinically associated with obesity 
and adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Our findings
indicate a role of TMEM18 as an upstream regulator of PPARG signaling driving
healthy adipogenesis, which is dysregulated with adipose tissue dysfunction and
obesity.

The germinal center (GC) reaction is essential for long-lived humoral immunity.
However, molecular requirements for the induction of Bcl6, the master regulator
for GC B cell differentiation, remain unclear. Through screening for cytokines
and other stimuli that regulate Bcl6 expression, we identify IL-4 as the
strongest inducer. IL-4 signaling alters the metabolomic profile in activated B
cells and induces accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate
(αKG), which is required for activation of the Bcl6 gene locus. Mechanistically, 
after IL-4 treatment, STAT6 bound to the known enhancers in the Bcl6 locus
recruits UTX, a demethylase for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 that
requires αKG as a cofactor. In turn, the H3K27me3 demethylation activates the
enhancers and transcription of the Bcl6 gene. We propose that IL-4-mediated
metabolic reprogramming in B cells is pivotal for epigenomic activation of Bcl6
expression to promote GC B cell differentiation.

The immune system is not only required for preventing threats exerted by
pathogens but also essential for developing immune tolerance to avoid tissue
damage. This study identifies a distinct mechanism by which MYSM1 suppresses
innate immunity and autoimmunity. The expression of MYSM1 is induced upon DNA
virus infection and by intracellular DNA stimulation. MYSM1 subsequently
interacts with STING and cleaves STING K63-linked ubiquitination to suppress
cGAS-STING signaling. Notably, Mysm1-deficient mice exhibit a hyper-inflammatory 
response, acute tissue damage, and high mortality upon virus infection. Moreover,
in the PBMCs of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), MYSM1
production decreases, while type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokine
expressions increase. Importantly, MYSM1 treatment represses the production of
IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PBMCs of SLE patients. Thus, MYSM1 is 
a critical repressor of innate immunity and autoimmunity and is thus a potential 
therapeutic agent for infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.

Cytosolic proteins are required for regulation of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (Nox) isozymes. Here we show that Src homology 3 
(SH3) domain-containing YSC84-like 1 (SH3YL1), as a Nox4 cytosolic regulator,
mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced H2O2 generation, leading to acute
kidney injury. The SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE proteins (SYLF)
region and SH3 domain of SH3YL1 contribute to formation of a complex with
Nox4-p22phox. Interaction of p22phox with SH3YL1 is triggered by LPS, and the
complex induces H2O2 generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in mouse
tubular epithelial cells. After LPS injection, SH3YL1 knockout mice show lower
levels of acute kidney injury biomarkers, decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, decreased infiltration of macrophages, and reduced tubular damage
compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The results strongly suggest that SH3YL1 is
involved in renal failure in LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mice. We
demonstrate that formation of a ternary complex of p22phox-SH3YL1-Nox4, leading
to H2O2 generation, induces severe renal failure in the LPS-induced AKI model.

The Hippo signaling pathway maintains organ size and tissue homeostasis via
orchestration of cell proliferation and apoptosis. How this pathway triggers cell
apoptosis remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify NR4A1 as a target of the 
Hippo pathway that mediates the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effects of the Hippo
pathway whereby YAP regulates the transcription, phosphorylation, and
mitochondrial localization of NR4A1. NR4A1, in turn, functions as a feedback
inhibitor of YAP to promote its degradation, thereby inhibiting the function of
YAP during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis. Our studies elucidate a
regulatory loop between NR4A1 and YAP to coordinate Hippo signaling activity
during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis and highlight NR4A1 as a marker of
Hippo signaling, as well as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

MutSα and MutSβ play important roles in DNA mismatch repair and are linked to
inheritable cancers and degenerative disorders. Here, we show that MSH2 and MSH3,
the two components of MutSβ, bind SLX4 protein, a scaffold for the assembly of
the SLX1-SLX4-MUS81-EME1-XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex. SMX promotes the
resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs), which are intermediates in homologous
recombinational repair. We find that MutSβ binds HJs and stimulates their
resolution by SLX1-SLX4 or SMX in reactions dependent upon direct interactions
between MutSβ and SLX4. In contrast, MutSα does not stimulate HJ resolution.
MSH3-depleted cells exhibit reduced sister chromatid exchanges and elevated
levels of homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) at mitosis,
consistent with defects in the processing of recombination intermediates. These
results demonstrate a role for MutSβ in addition to its established role in the
pathogenic expansion of CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats, which is causative of
myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease.

Bioenergetic reprogramming during hypoxia adaption is critical to promote
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and progression. However, the mechanism
underlying the orchestration of mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) 
and glycolysis in hypoxia is not fully understood. Here, we report that
mitochondrial UQCC3 (C11orf83) expression increases in hypoxia and correlates
with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Loss of UQCC3 impairs HCC cell
proliferation in hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UQCC3 forms a
positive feedback loop with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) to
sustain UQCC3 expression and ROS generation in hypoxic HCC cells and subsequently
maintains mitochondrial structure and function and stabilizes HIF-1α expression
to enhance glycolysis under hypoxia. Thus, UQCC3 plays an indispensable role for 
bioenergetic reprogramming of HCC cells during hypoxia adaption by simultaneously
regulating OXPHOS and glycolysis. The positive feedback between UQCC3 and ROS
indicates a self-modulating model within mitochondria that initiates the
adaptation of HCC to hypoxic stress.

Dysregulated gene expression is a common feature of cancer and may underlie some 
aspects of tumor progression, including tumor relapse. Here, we show that
recurrent mammary tumors exhibit global changes in gene expression and histone
modifications and acquire dependence on the G9a histone methyltransferase.
Genetic ablation of G9a delays tumor recurrence, and pharmacologic inhibition of 
G9a slows the growth of recurrent tumors. Mechanistically, G9a activity is
required to silence pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), through H3K9 methylation at gene promoters. G9a inhibition induces
re-expression of these cytokines, leading to p53 activation and necroptosis.
Recurrent tumors upregulate receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3)
expression and are dependent upon RIPK3 activity. High RIPK3 expression renders
recurrent tumors sensitive to necroptosis following G9a inhibition. These
findings demonstrate that G9a-mediated silencing of pro-necroptotic proteins is a
critical step in tumor recurrence and suggest that G9a is a targetable dependency
in recurrent breast cancer.

We report here that the autocrine signaling mediated by growth and
differentiation factor 6 (GDF6), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
family of cytokines, maintains Ewing sarcoma growth by preventing Src
hyperactivation. Surprisingly, Ewing sarcoma depends on the prodomain, not the
BMP domain, of GDF6. We demonstrate that the GDF6 prodomain is a ligand for CD99,
a transmembrane protein that has been widely used as a marker of Ewing sarcoma.
The binding of the GDF6 prodomain to the CD99 extracellular domain results in
recruitment of CSK (C-terminal Src kinase) to the YQKKK motif in the
intracellular domain of CD99, inhibiting Src activity. GDF6 silencing causes
hyperactivation of Src and p21-dependent growth arrest. We demonstrate that two
GDF6 prodomain mutants linked to Klippel-Feil syndrome are hyperactive in
CD99-Src signaling. These results reveal a cytokine signaling pathway that
regulates the CSK-Src axis and cancer cell proliferation and suggest the
gain-of-function activity for disease-causing GDF6 mutants.

Nerve injury in somatosensory pathways may lead to neuropathic pain, which
affects the life quality of ∼8% of people. Long-term enhancement of excitatory
synaptic transmission along somatosensory pathways contributes to neuropathic
pain. Caspase 3 (Casp3) plays a non-apoptotic role in the hippocampus and
regulates internalization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
receptor (AMPAR) subunits. Whether Casp3-AMPAR interaction is involved in the
maintenance of peripheral hypersensitivity after nerve injury remained unknown.
Here, we show that nerve injury suppresses long-term depression (LTD) and
downregulates Casp3 in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Interfering with
interactions between Casp3 and AMPAR subunits or reducing Casp3 activity in the
ACC suppresses LTD induction and causes peripheral hypersensitivity.
Overexpression of Casp3 restores LTD and reduces peripheral hypersensitivity
after nerve injury. We reveal how Casp3 is involved in the maintenance of
peripheral hypersensitivity. Our findings suggest that restoration of LTD via
Casp3 provides a therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain management.

Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that function in a multitude of
physiological contexts to perform chemosensing, mechanosensing, and fluid
propulsion. The process of ciliogenesis is highly regulated, and disruptions
result in disease states termed ciliopathies. Here, we report that peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (ppargc1a) is
essential for ciliogenesis in nodal, mono-, and multiciliated cells (MCCs) and
for discernment of renal tubule ciliated cell fate during embryogenesis. ppargc1a
performs these functions by affecting prostaglandin signaling, whereby cilia
formation and renal MCC fate are restored with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment 
in ppargc1a-deficient animals. Genetic disruption of ppargc1a specifically
reduces expression of the prostanoid biosynthesis gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase 1 (ptgs1), and suboptimal knockdown of both genes shows this synergistic
effect. Furthermore, ptgs1 overexpression rescues ciliogenesis and renal MCCs in 
ppargc1a-deficient embryos. These findings position Ppargc1a as a key genetic
regulator of prostaglandin signaling during ciliated cell ontogeny.

Tissue injury is one of the most severe environmental perturbations for a living 
organism. When damage occurs in adult Drosophila, there is a local response of
the injured tissue and a coordinated action across different tissues to help the 
organism overcome the deleterious effect of an injury. We show a change in the
transcriptome of hemocytes at the site of tissue injury, with pronounced
activation of the Toll signaling pathway. We find that induction of the cytokine 
upd-3 and Toll receptor activation occur in response to injury alone, in the
absence of a pathogen. Intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in
hemocytes is essential for upd-3 induction and is facilitated by the diffusion of
hydrogen peroxide through a channel protein Prip. Importantly, hemocyte
activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the site of a
sterile injury provide protection to flies on subsequent infection, demonstrating
training of the innate immune system.

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) activates lysosomal biogenesis genes in response
to environmental cues. Given implications of impaired TFEB signaling and
lysosomal dysfunction in metabolic, neurological, and infectious diseases, we aim
to systematically identify TFEB-directed circuits by examining transcriptional
responses to TFEB subcellular localization and stimulation. We reveal that
steady-state nuclear TFEB is sufficient to activate transcription of lysosomal,
autophagy, and innate immunity genes, whereas other targets require higher
thresholds of stimulation. Furthermore, we identify shared and distinct
transcriptional signatures between mTOR inhibition and bacterial autophagy. Using
a genome-wide CRISPR library, we find TFEB targets that protect cells from or
sensitize cells to lysosomal cell death. BHLHE40 and BHLHE41, genes responsive to
high, sustained levels of nuclear TFEB, act in opposition to TFEB upon lysosomal 
cell death induction. Further investigation identifies genes counter-regulated by
TFEB and BHLHE40/41, adding this negative feedback to the current understanding
of TFEB regulatory mechanisms.

The Drosophila midgut is an excellent system for characterizing cell cycle
regulation in the context of tissue homeostasis. Two major progenitor cell types 
populate the midgut: mitotic intestinal stem cells and their post-mitotic
daughters, enteroblasts. Although regulatory networks that control stem cell
proliferation are well characterized, how enteroblast mitotic-cell-cycle exit is 
coordinated with endocycle entry and enterocyte specification remains poorly
defined. Myt1 is a conserved Cdk1 inhibitory kinase that regulates mitotic timing
during animal development. Here, we use myt1-null mutants and cell-specific RNA
interference to investigate Myt1 function in stem cells and enteroblast
progenitors. Myt1 depletion alters cell cycle kinetics and promotes ectopic stem 
cell and enteroblast mitoses at the expense of enteroblast-enterocyte
differentiation. These aberrant enteroblast mitoses rely upon cyclin A,
implicating Myt1 inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk1 as a mechanism for the coupling
mitotic exit with differentiation in enteroblasts.

After optic nerve crush (ONC), the cell bodies and distal axons of most retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) degenerate. RGC somal and distal axon degenerations were
previously thought to be controlled by two parallel pathways, involving
activation of the kinase dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) and loss of the axon
survival factor nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-2 (NMNAT2),
respectively. Here, we report that palmitoylation of both DLK and NMNAT2 by the
palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC17 couples these signals. ZDHHC17-dependent
palmitoylation enables DLK-dependent somal degeneration after ONC and also
ensures NMNAT-dependent distal axon integrity in healthy optic nerves. We provide
evidence that ZDHHC17 also controls survival-versus-degeneration decisions in
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we identify conserved motifs in NMNAT2
and DLK that govern their ZDHHC17-dependent regulation. These findings suggest
that the control of somal and distal axon integrity should be considered as a
single, holistic process, mediated by the concerted action of two
palmitoylation-dependent pathways.

The NLRP3 inflammasome, a critical component of the innate immune system, induces
caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1β maturation in response to microbial 
infection and cellular damage. However, aberrant activation of the NLRP3
inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders,
including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Alzheimer's disease, type 2
diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we identify the receptor for activated
protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) as a component of the NLRP3 complexes in macrophages. 
RACK1 interacts with NLRP3 and NEK7 but not ASC. Suppression of RACK1 expression 
abrogates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release in response to NLRP3- but not
NLRC4- or AIM2-activating stimuli. This RACK1 function is independent of its
ribosomal binding activity. Mechanistically, RACK1 promotes the active
conformation of NLRP3 induced by activating stimuli and subsequent inflammasome
assembly. These results demonstrate that RACK1 is a critical mediator for NLRP3
inflammasome activation.

Unveiling the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration provides new
opportunities to develop treatments for diabetic ulcers and other chronic skin
lesions. Here, we show that Ccl2 secretion by epidermal keratinocytes is directly
orchestrated by Nrf2, a prominent transcriptional regulator of tissue
regeneration that is activated early after cutaneous injury. Through a unique
feedback mechanism, we find that Ccl2 from epidermal keratinocytes not only
drives chemotaxis of macrophages into the wound but also triggers macrophage
expression of EGF, which in turn activates basal epidermal keratinocyte
proliferation. Notably, we find dysfunctional activation of Nrf2 in epidermal
keratinocytes of diabetic mice after wounding, which partly explains regenerative
impairments associated with diabetes. These findings provide mechanistic insight 
into the critical relationship between keratinocyte and macrophage signaling
during tissue repair, providing the basis for continued investigation of the
therapeutic value of Nrf2.

Gene expression is controlled by the collective binding of transcription factors 
to cis-regulatory regions. Deciphering gene-centered regulatory networks is vital
to understanding and controlling gene misexpression in human disease; however,
systematic approaches to uncovering regulatory networks have been lacking. Here
we present high-throughput interrogation of gene-centered activation networks
(HIGAN), a pipeline that employs a suite of multifaceted genomic approaches to
connect upstream signaling inputs, trans-acting TFs, and cis-regulatory elements.
We apply HIGAN to understand the aberrant activation of the cytidine deaminase
APOBEC3B, an intrinsic source of cancer hypermutation. We reveal that nuclear
factor κB (NF-κB) and AP-1 pathways are the most salient trans-acting inputs,
with minor roles for other inflammatory pathways. We identify a cis-regulatory
architecture dominated by a major intronic enhancer that requires coordinated
NF-κB and AP-1 activity with secondary inputs from distal regulatory regions. Our
data demonstrate how integration of cis and trans genomic screening platforms
provides a paradigm for building gene-centered regulatory networks.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade downstream of the B
cell receptor (BCR) signalosome is essential for B cell maturation. Proper
signaling strength is maintained through the PI3K negative regulator phosphatase 
and tensin homolog (PTEN). Although a role for microRNA (miRNA)-dependent control
of the PTEN-PI3K axis has been described, the contribution of individual miRNAs
to the regulation of this crucial signaling modality in mature B lymphocytes
remains to be elucidated. Our analyses reveal that ablation of miR-29
specifically in B lymphocytes results in an increase in PTEN expression and
dampening of the PI3K pathway in mature B cells. This dysregulation has a
profound impact on the survival of B lymphocytes and results in increased class
switch recombination and decreased plasma cell differentiation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that ablation of one copy of Pten is sufficient to ameliorate the
phenotypes associated with miR-29 loss. Our data suggest a critical role for the 
miR-29-PTEN-PI3K regulatory axis in mature B lymphocytes.

The widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are derivatives of
the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). SA is well known to regulate plant immunity
and development, whereas there have been few reports focusing on the effects of
NSAIDs in plants. Our studies here reveal that NSAIDs exhibit largely overlapping
physiological activities to SA in the model plant Arabidopsis. NSAID treatments
lead to shorter and agravitropic primary roots and inhibited lateral root
organogenesis. Notably, in addition to the SA-like action, which in roots
involves binding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), NSAIDs also exhibit
PP2A-independent effects. Cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that
many NSAIDs bind directly to and inhibit the chaperone activity of TWISTED
DWARF1, thereby regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and subsequent endosomal
trafficking. Our findings uncover an unexpected bioactivity of human
pharmaceuticals in plants and provide insights into the molecular mechanism
underlying the cellular action of this class of anti-inflammatory compounds.

Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of programed cell death caused by the
metabolically regulated lipid peroxidation and holds promise for cancer
treatment, but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we
observe that lactate-rich liver cancer cells exhibit enhanced resistance to the
ferroptotic damage induced by common ferroptosis inducers such as Ras-selective
lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) and Erastin and that the monocarboxylate
transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated lactate uptake could promote ATP production in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and deactivate the energy sensor
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the upregulation of sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the downstream
stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1 (SCD1) to enhance the production of
anti-ferroptosis monounsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, blocking the lactate 
uptake via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1)/MCT1 inhibition promotes
ferroptosis by activating the AMPK to downregulate SCD1, which may synergize with
its acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-promoting effect to amplify the
ferroptotic susceptibility. In vitro and in vivo evidence confirms that lactate
regulates the ferroptosis of HCC cells and highlights its translational potential
as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis-based tumor treatment.

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS), upon sensing cytosolic 
DNA, catalyzes the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine
monophosphate (cGAMP), which activates STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling. cGAS is also
present in the nucleus, but the relevant nuclear function or mechanism remains
largely unknown. Here, we report that nuclear cGAS is indispensable for inducing 
cytokines and chemokines triggered by RNA/DNA viruses. Unexpectedly, the
DNA-binding/nucleotidyltransferase activity of cGAS is dispensable for
RNA-virus-induced genes expression. cGAS deficiency does not affect the
phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mechanistically, nuclear-localized cGAS interacts
with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5), which catalyzes the symmetric 
dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 at Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters, thus
facilitating the access of IRF3. Deficiency of Prmt5 or disrupting its catalytic 
activity suppresses the production of type I interferons (IFNs), impairing the
host defenses against RNA/DNA virus infections. Taken together, our study
uncovers a non-canonical function of nuclear-localized cGAS in innate immunity
via regulating histone arginine modification.

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with the capacity to elicit
adaptive features, including clonal expansion and immunological memory. Because
signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is essential for NK
cell development, the roles of this transcription factor and its upstream
cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 during infection have not been carefully
investigated. In this study, we investigate how STAT5 regulates transcription
during viral infection. We demonstrate that STAT5 is induced in NK cells by IL-12
and STAT4 early after infection and that partial STAT5 deficiency results in a
defective capacity of NK cells to generate long-lived memory cells. Furthermore, 
we find a functional dichotomy of IL-2 and IL-15 signaling outputs during viral
infection, whereby both cytokines drive clonal expansion, but only IL-15 is
required for memory NK cell survival. We thus highlight a role for STAT5
signaling in promoting an optimal anti-viral NK cell response.

Cytokines are highly pleiotropic ligands that regulate the immune response. Here,
using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed
phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells
to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We
identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which 
interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using
specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by
23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target 
DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a
concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly,
inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an
enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8
regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci
resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.

The chromatin protein positive coactivator 4 (PC4) has multiple functions,
including chromatin compaction. However, its role in immune cells is largely
unknown. We show that PC4 orchestrates chromatin structure and gene expression in
mature B cells. B-cell-specific PC4-deficient mice show impaired production of
antibody upon antigen stimulation. The PC4 complex purified from B cells contains
the transcription factors (TFs) IKAROS and IRF4. IKAROS protein is reduced in
PC4-deficient mature B cells, resulting in de-repression of their target genes in
part by diminished interactions with gene-silencing components. Upon activation, 
the amount of IRF4 protein is not increased in PC4-deficient B cells, resulting
in reduction of plasma cells. Importantly, IRF4 reciprocally induces PC4
expression via a super-enhancer. PC4 knockdown in human B cell lymphoma and
myeloma cells reduces IKAROS protein as an anticancer drug, lenalidomide. Our
findings establish PC4 as a chromatin regulator of B cells and a possible
therapeutic target adjoining IKAROS in B cell malignancies.

During chronic infection, the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ)
damages hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by disrupting quiescence and promoting
excessive terminal differentiation. However, the mechanism by which IFNγ hinders 
HSC quiescence remains undefined. Using intravital 3-dimensional microscopy, we
find that IFNγ disrupts the normally close interaction between HSCs and
CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the HSC niche. IFNγ stimulation
increases expression of the cell surface protein BST2, which we find is required 
for IFNγ-dependent HSC relocalization and activation. IFNγ stimulation of HSCs
increases their E-selectin binding by BST2 and homing to the bone marrow, which
depends on E-selectin binding. Upon chronic infection, HSCs from mice lacking
BST2 are more quiescent and more resistant to depletion than HSCs from wild-type 
mice. Overall, this study defines a critical mechanism by which IFNγ promotes
niche relocalization and activation in response to inflammatory stimulation and
identifies BST2 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) controls cell metabolism
and survival in response to environmental inputs. Dysregulation of mTORC2
signaling has been linked to diverse human diseases, including cancer and
metabolic disorders, highlighting the importance of a tightly controlled mTORC2. 
While mTORC2 assembly is a critical determinant of its activity, the factors
regulating this event are not well understood, and it is unclear whether this
process is regulated by growth factors. Here, we present data, from human cell
lines and mice, describing a mechanism by which growth factors regulate
ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) deubiquitinase to stimulate mTORC2
assembly and activity. USP9X removes Lys63-linked ubiquitin from RICTOR to
promote its interaction with mTOR, thereby facilitating mTORC2 signaling. As
mTORC2 is central for cellular homeostasis, understanding the mechanisms
regulating mTORC2 activation toward its downstream targets is vital for our
understanding of physiological processes and for developing new therapeutic
strategies in pathology.

The present study demonstrates that topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) forms both RNA and
DNA cleavage complexes (TOP3Bccs) in vivo and reveals a pathway for repairing
TOP3Bccs. For inducing and detecting cellular TOP3Bccs, we engineer a
"self-trapping" mutant of TOP3B (R338W-TOP3B). Transfection with R338W-TOP3B
induces R-loops, genomic damage, and growth defect, which highlights the
importance of TOP3Bcc repair mechanisms. To determine how cells repair TOP3Bccs, 
we deplete tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDP1 and TDP2). TDP2-deficient cells
show elevated TOP3Bccs both in DNA and RNA. Conversely, overexpression of TDP2
lowers cellular TOP3Bccs. Using recombinant human TDP2, we demonstrate that TDP2 
can process both denatured and proteolyzed TOP3Bccs. We also show that cellular
TOP3Bccs are ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase TRIM41 before undergoing proteasomal 
processing and excision by TDP2.

Altering ubiquitination by disruption of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) affects 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. However, comprehensive knowledge of
DUB function during hematopoiesis in vivo is lacking. Here, we systematically
inactivate DUBs in mouse hematopoietic progenitors using in vivo small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) screens. We find that multiple DUBs may be individually required for 
hematopoiesis and identify ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as essential
for HSC maintenance in vitro and in transplantations and Usp15 knockout (KO) mice
in vivo. USP15 is highly expressed in human hematopoietic tissues and leukemias. 
USP15 depletion in murine progenitors and leukemia cells impairs in vitro
expansion and increases genotoxic stress. In leukemia cells, USP15 interacts with
and stabilizes FUS (fused in sarcoma), a known DNA repair factor, directly
linking USP15 to the DNA damage response (DDR). Our study underscores the
importance of DUBs in preserving normal hematopoiesis and uncovers USP15 as a
critical DUB in safeguarding genome integrity in HSCs and leukemia cells.

Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate IRE1α
endoribonuclease in mammalian cells, which mediates XBP1 mRNA splicing to produce
an active transcription factor. This promotes the expression of specific genes to
alleviate ER stress, thereby attenuating IRE1α. Although sustained activation of 
IRE1α is linked to human diseases, it is not clear how IRE1α is attenuated during
ER stress. Here, we identify that Sec63 is a subunit of the previously identified
IRE1α/Sec61 translocon complex. We find that Sec63 recruits and activates BiP
ATPase through its luminal J-domain to bind onto IRE1α. This leads to inhibition 
of higher-order oligomerization and attenuation of IRE1α RNase activity during
prolonged ER stress. In Sec63-deficient cells, IRE1α remains activated for a long
period of time despite the presence of excess BiP in the ER. Thus, our data
suggest that the Sec61 translocon bridges IRE1α with Sec63/BiP to regulate the
dynamics of IRE1α signaling in cells.

Early lineage-specific master regulators are essential for the specification of
cell types. However, once cells are committed to a specific fate, it is critical 
to restrict the activity of such factors to enable differentiation. To date, it
remains unclear how these factors are silenced. Using the Drosophila mesoderm as 
a model and a comparative genomic approach, we identify the Hox transcription
factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) to be critical for the repression of the master
regulator Twist. Mesoderm-specific Ubx loss-of-function experiments using
CRISPR-Cas9 and overexpression studies demonstrate that Ubx majorly impacts twist
transcription. A mechanistic analysis reveals that Ubx requires the
NK-homeodomain protein Tinman to bind to the twist promoter. Furthermore, we find
these factor interactions to be critical for silencing by recruiting the Polycomb
DNA binding protein Pleiohomeotic. Altogether, our data reveal that Ubx is a
critical player in mediating the silencing of Twist, which is crucial for
coordinated muscle differentiation.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a chronic, low-grade
inflammatory disease characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell
dysfunction; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here,
we report a key β cell-macrophage crosstalk pathway mediated by the
miRNA-29-TNF-receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) axis. β cell-specific
transgenic miR-29a/b/c mice are predisposed to develop glucose intolerance and
insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The metabolic effect of β cell
miR-29 is largely mediated through macrophages because either depletion of
macrophages or reconstitution with miR-29-signaling defective bone marrow
improves metabolic parameters in the transgenic mice. Mechanistically, our data
show that miR-29 promotes the recruitment and activation of circulating monocytes
and macrophages and, hence, inflammation, via miR-29 exosomes in a
TRAF3-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate the ability of β cells to
modulate the systemic inflammatory tone and glucose homeostasis via miR-29 in
response to nutrient overload.

Potent therapeutic inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate
adenocarcinoma can lead to the emergence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer
(NEPC), a phenomenon associated with enhanced cell plasticity. Here, we show that
microRNA-194 (miR-194) is a regulator of epithelial-neuroendocrine
transdifferentiation. In clinical prostate cancer samples, miR-194 expression and
activity were elevated in NEPC and inversely correlated with AR signaling.
miR-194 facilitated the emergence of neuroendocrine features in prostate cancer
cells, a process mediated by its ability to directly target a suite of genes
involved in cell plasticity. One such target was FOXA1, which encodes a
transcription factor with a vital role in maintaining the prostate epithelial
lineage. Importantly, a miR-194 inhibitor blocked epithelial-neuroendocrine
transdifferentiation and inhibited the growth of cell lines and patient-derived
organoids possessing neuroendocrine features. Overall, our study reveals a
post-transcriptional mechanism regulating the plasticity of prostate cancer cells
and provides a rationale for targeting miR-194 in NEPC.

Piwi proteins are a subfamily of Argonaute proteins that maintain germ cells in
eukaryotes. However, the role of their human homologs in cancer stem cells, and
more broadly in cancer, is poorly understood. Here, we report that Piwi-like
family members are overexpressed in glioblastoma (GBM), with Piwil1 (Hiwi) most
frequently overexpressed (88%). Piwil1 is enriched in glioma stem-like cells
(GSCs) to maintain self-renewal. Silencing Piwil1 in GSCs leads to global changes
in gene expression resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis.
Piwil1 knockdown increases expression of the transcriptional co-regulator BTG2
and the E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, leading to reduced c-Myc expression, as well
as loss of expression of stem cell factors Olig2 and Nestin. Piwil1 regulates
mRNA stability of BTG2, FBXW7, and CDKN1B. In animal models of GBM, Piwil1
knockdown suppresses tumor growth and promotes mouse survival. These findings
support a role of Piwil1 in GSC maintenance and glioblastoma progression.

O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is a unique enzyme
introducing O-GlcNAc moiety on target proteins, and it critically regulates
various cellular processes in diverse cell types. However, its roles in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain elusive. Here, using Ogt
conditional knockout mice, we show that OGT is essential for HSPCs. Ogt is highly
expressed in HSPCs, and its disruption induces rapid loss of HSPCs with increased
reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. In particular, Ogt-deficient hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) lose quiescence, cannot be maintained in vivo, and become
vulnerable to regenerative and competitive stress. Interestingly, Ogt-deficient
HSCs accumulate defective mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy with decreased
key mitophagy regulator, Pink1, through dysregulation of H3K4me3. Furthermore,
overexpression of PINK1 restores mitophagy and the number of Ogt-deficient HSCs. 
Collectively, our results reveal that OGT critically regulates maintenance and
stress response of HSCs by ensuring mitochondrial quality through PINK1-dependent
mitophagy.

Recent studies have profiled the innate immune signatures in patients infected
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and suggest
that cellular responses to viral challenge may affect disease severity. Yet the
molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2
infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication
induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By
screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we
found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates
specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing.
Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-κB/p65 are the key transcription
factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary,
these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate
immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.

The JAK/STAT1 pathway is generally activated by cytokines, providing essential
antiviral defense. Here, we identify that STAT1 activation is independent of
cytokines and JAKs at the early infection stage of some viruses, including
influenza A virus (IAV). Instead, STAT1 is activated mainly through spleen
tyrosine kinase (Syk) downstream of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I/mitochondrial 
antiviral-signaling protein (RIG-I/MAVS) signaling. Syk deletion profoundly
impairs immediate innate immunity, as evidenced by the finding that Syk deletion 
attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and reduces the expressions of
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral response
to IAV infection is also significantly suppressed in the STAT1Y701F knockin mice.
The results demonstrate that STAT1 activation is dependent on Syk rather than the
cytokine-activated JAK signaling at the early stage of viral infection, which is 
critical for initial antiviral immunity. Our finding provides insights into the
complicated mechanisms underlying host immune responses to viral infection.

Mitochondria not only serve as a platform for innate immune signaling
transduction but also enhance immune responses by releasing mitochondrial DNA and
RNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether mitochondrial matrix proteins could be
liberated and involved in immune responses remains enigmatic. Here, we identify
the mitochondrial protein ERA G-protein-like 1 (ERAL1) as a mitochondrial
antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-interacting protein by using proximity-based
labeling technology. ERAL1 deficiency markedly reduces the downstream antiviral
signaling triggered by RNA viruses. Moreover, ERAL1-deficient mice are more
susceptible to lethality following RNA virus infection than wild-type mice. After
virus infection, ERAL1 is released from mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore.
The cytosolic ERAL1 facilitates lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of
retinoicacid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 
(MDA5) and promotes downstream MAVS polymerization, thus positively regulating
antiviral responses.

The endolysosomal system fulfills a wide variety of cellular functions, many of
which are modulated through interactions with other organelles. In particular,
the ER exerts spatiotemporal constraints on the organization and motility of
endosomes and lysosomes. We have recently described the ER transmembrane E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF26 as a regulator of endolysosomal perinuclear positioning
and transport dynamics. Here, we report that the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
UBE2J1, also anchored in the ER membrane, partners with RNF26 in this context,
and that the cellular activity of the resulting E2/E3 pair is localized in a
perinuclear ER subdomain and supported by transmembrane interactions. Through
modification of SQSTM1/p62 on lysine 435, the ER-embedded UBE2J1/RNF26
ubiquitylation complex recruits endosomal adaptors to immobilize their cognate
vesicles in the perinuclear region of the cell. The resulting spatiotemporal
compartmentalization promotes the trafficking of activated EGFR to lysosomes and 
facilitates the termination of EGF-induced AKT signaling.

DNA replication is challenged by numerous exogenous and endogenous factors that
can interfere with the progression of replication forks. Substantial accumulation
of single-stranded DNA during DNA replication activates the DNA replication
stress checkpoint response that slows progression from S/G2 to M phase to protect
genomic integrity. Whether and how mild replication stress restricts
proliferation remains controversial. Here, we identify a cell cycle exit
mechanism that prevents S/G2 phase arrested cells from undergoing mitosis after
exposure to mild replication stress through premature activation of the anaphase 
promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/CCDH1). We find that replication stress causes a
gradual decrease of the levels of the APC/CCDH1 inhibitor EMI1/FBXO5 through
Forkhead box O (FOXO)-mediated inhibition of its transcription factor E2F1. By
doing so, FOXOs limit the time during which the replication stress checkpoint is 
reversible and thereby play an important role in maintaining genomic stability.

Muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a quiescent (non-proliferative) stem cell
population in uninjured skeletal muscle. Although SCs have been investigated for 
nearly 60 years, the molecular drivers that transform quiescent SCs into the
rapidly dividing (activated) stem/progenitor cells that mediate muscle repair
after injury remain largely unknown. Here we identify a prominent FBJ
osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos) mRNA and protein signature in recently activated SCs 
that is rapidly, heterogeneously, and transiently induced by muscle damage. We
further reveal a requirement for FOS to efficiently initiate key stem cell
functions, including cell cycle entry, proliferative expansion, and muscle
regeneration, via induction of "pro-regenerative" target genes that stimulate
cell migration, division, and differentiation. Disruption of one of these
Fos/AP-1 targets, NAD(+)-consuming mono-ADP-ribosyl-transferase 1 (Art1), in SCs 
delays cell cycle entry and impedes progenitor cell expansion and muscle
regeneration. This work uncovers an early-activated
FOS/ART1/mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) pathway that is essential for stem
cell-regenerative responses.

The cell-cycle phase is a major determinant of repair pathway choice at DNA
double strand breaks, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or homologous
recombination (HR). Chk1 responds to genotoxic stress in S/G2 phase, but here, we
report a role of Chk1 in directly promoting NHEJ repair in G1 phase. ASF1A is a
histone chaperone, but it promotes NHEJ through a pathway independent of its
histone-chaperone activity. Chk1 activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
kinase on DNA breaks in G1 promotes NHEJ through direct phosphorylation of ASF1A 
at Ser-166. ASF1A phosphorylated at Ser-166 interacts with the repair protein
MDC1 and thus enhances MDC1's interaction with ATM and the stable localization of
ATM at DNA breaks. Chk1 deficiency suppresses all steps downstream of MDC1
following a DNA break in G1, namely histone ubiquitination, 53BP1 localization to
the DNA break, and NHEJ. Thus, ASF1A phosphorylation by Chk1 is essential for DNA
break repair by NHEJ in G1.

The signal adaptor MyD88, an essential component of TLR signaling, plays an
important role in gut-microbiome interactions. However, its contribution to
colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is still controversial. Far less is known about
the specific effects of MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts in CAC development.
Here, we used a CAC mouse model in which MyD88 was selectively depleted in
myofibroblasts. Myofibroblast MyD88-deficient mice are resistant to azoxymethane 
(AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced tumorigenesis, as evidenced by the
decrease in the number and sizes of tumors. MyD88 deficiency in myofibroblasts
attenuates intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation after acute DSS-induced
colitis. Furthermore, MyD88 signaling in myofibroblasts increases the secretion
of osteopontin (OPN), which promotes macrophage M2 polarization through binding
to αvβ3 and CD44, leading to activation of the STAT3/PPARγ pathway. Thus, MyD88
signaling in myofibroblasts crucially contributes to colorectal cancer
development and provides a promising therapeutic target for the prevention of
colitis-associated carcinogenesis.

Bacterial pneumonia is a global healthcare burden, and unwarranted inflammation
is suggested as an important cause of mortality. Optimum levels of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are essential to reduce inflammation and improve
survival in pneumonia. Elevated levels of the mitochondrial-DAMP cardiolipin
(CL), reported in tracheal aspirates of pneumonia patients, have been shown to
block IL-10 production from lung MDSCs. Although CL-mediated K107 SUMOylation of 
PPARγ has been suggested to impair this IL-10 production, the mechanism remains
elusive. We identify PIAS2 to be the specific E3-SUMOligase responsible for this 
SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify a concomitant CL-mediated PPARγ S112
phosphorylation, mediated by JNK-MAPK, to be essential for PIAS2 recruitment.
Furthermore, using a clinically tested peptide inhibitor targeting JNK-MAPK, we
blocked these post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PPARγ and rescued IL-10 
expression, improving survival in murine pneumonia models. Thus, we explore the
mechanism of mito-DAMP-mediated impaired lung inflammation resolution and propose
a therapeutic strategy targeting PPARγ PTMs.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global health threat caused by
the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Emerging evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dysregulated 
immune response and a delayed interferon (IFN) expression in patients, which
contribute largely to the viral pathogenesis and development of COVID-19.
However, underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the
activation and repression of the innate immune response by SARS-CoV-2. We show
that SARS-CoV-2 RNA activates the RIG-I-MAVS-dependent IFN signaling pathway. We 
further uncover that ORF9b immediately accumulates and antagonizes the antiviral 
type I IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection on primary human pulmonary
alveolar epithelial cells. ORF9b targets the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) essential 
modulator NEMO and interrupts its K63-linked polyubiquitination upon viral
stimulation, thereby inhibiting the canonical IκB kinase alpha (IKKα)/β/γ-NF-κB
signaling and subsequent IFN production. Our findings thus unveil the innate
immunosuppression by ORF9b and provide insights into the host-virus interplay
during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The intestine is under constant exposure to chemicals, antigens, and
microorganisms from the external environment. Apical aspects of transporting
epithelial cells (enterocytes) form a brush-border membrane (BBM), shaped by
packed microvilli coated with a dense glycocalyx. We present evidence showing
that the glycocalyx forms an epithelial barrier that prevents exogenous molecules
and live bacteria from gaining access to BBM. We use a multi-omics approach to
investigate the function and regulation of membrane mucins exposed on the BBM
during postnatal development of the mouse small intestine. Muc17 is identified as
a major membrane mucin in the glycocalyx that is specifically upregulated by
IL-22 as part of an epithelial defense repertoire during weaning. High levels of 
IL-22 at time of weaning reprogram neonatal postmitotic progenitor enterocytes to
differentiate into Muc17-expressing enterocytes, as found in the adult intestine 
during homeostasis. Our findings propose a role for Muc17 in epithelial barrier
function in the small intestine.

SOX17 has been implicated in arterial specification and the maintenance of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the murine embryo. However, knowledge about
molecular pathways and stage-specific effects of SOX17 in humans remains limited.
Here, using SOX17-knockout and SOX17-inducible human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs), paired with molecular profiling studies, we reveal that SOX17 is a
master regulator of HOXA and arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium (HE) and 
is required for the specification of HE with robust lympho-myeloid potential and 
DLL4+CXCR4+ phenotype resembling arterial HE at the sites of HSC emergence. Along
with the activation of NOTCH signaling, SOX17 directly activates CDX2 expression,
leading to the upregulation of the HOXA cluster genes. Since deficiencies in HOXA
and NOTCH signaling contribute to the impaired in vivo engraftment of
hPSC-derived hematopoietic cells, the identification of SOX17 as a key regulator 
linking arterial and HOXA programs in HE may help to program HSC fate from hPSCs.

Aberrant expression of nuclear transporters and deregulated subcellular
localization of their cargo proteins are emerging as drivers and therapeutic
targets of cancer. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear exporter exportin-6
and its cargo profilin-1 constitute a functionally important and frequently
deregulated axis in cancer. Exportin-6 upregulation occurs in numerous cancer
types and is associated with poor patient survival. Reducing exportin-6 level in 
breast cancer cells triggers antitumor effects by accumulating nuclear
profilin-1. Mechanistically, nuclear profilin-1 interacts with
eleven-nineteen-leukemia protein (ENL) within the super elongation complex (SEC) 
and inhibits the ability of the SEC to drive transcription of numerous pro-cancer
genes including MYC. XPO6 and MYC are positively correlated across diverse cancer
types including breast cancer. Therapeutically, exportin-6 loss sensitizes breast
cancer cells to the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1. Thus,
exportin-6 upregulation is a previously unrecognized cancer driver event by
spatially inhibiting nuclear profilin-1 as a tumor suppressor.

Mossy cells (MCs) are a unique group of excitatory neurons in the hippocampus, a 
brain region important for emotion, learning, and memory. Due to the lack of a
reliable method to isolate MCs from other cell types, how MCs integrate neural
information and convey it to their synaptic targets for engaging a specific
function are still unknown. Here, we report that MCs control the efficacy of
spatial memory retrieval by synapsing directly onto local somatostatin-expressing
(SST) cells. MC-SST synaptic transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP),
requiring Gria2-lacking Ca2+-permeable
anti-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor
(Ca2+AR). A long noncoding RNA (Gria2I) is associated with Gria2 transcriptional 
repressors in SST cells. Silencing Gria2I induces Gria2 transcription, blocks LTP
of MCs-SST synaptic transmission, and reduces the efficacy of memory retrieval.
Thus, MCs directly and functionally innervate local SST neurons, and this
innervation controls the efficacy of spatial memory retrieval by Gria2I
inhibition of Gria2 transcription.

Estrogen receptor-α (ER) drives tumor development in ER-positive (ER+) breast
cancer. The transcription factor GATA3 has been closely linked to ER function,
but its precise role in this setting remains unclear. Quantitative proteomics was
used to assess changes to the ER complex in response to GATA3 depletion.
Unexpectedly, few proteins were lost from the ER complex in the absence of GATA3,
with the only major change being depletion of the dioxygenase TET2. TET2 binding 
constituted a near-total subset of ER binding in multiple breast cancer models,
with loss of TET2 associated with reduced activation of proliferative pathways.
TET2 knockdown did not appear to change global methylated cytosine (5mC) levels; 
however, oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was significantly
reduced, and these events occurred at ER enhancers. These findings implicate TET2
in the maintenance of 5hmC at ER sites, providing a potential mechanism for
TET2-mediated regulation of ER target genes.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies
worldwide. One major obstacle to treatment is a lack of effective
molecular-targeted therapies. In this study, we find that EphA2 expression and
signaling are enriched in human HCC and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of
EphA2 suppresses the initiation and growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated EphA2 inhibition significantly delays tumor
development in a genetically engineered murine model of HCC. Mechanistically, we 
discover that targeting EphA2 suppresses both AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling, two
separate oncogenic pathways in HCC. We also identify a small molecule kinase
inhibitor of EphA2 that suppresses tumor progression in a murine HCC model.
Together, our results suggest EphA2 as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.

Muscle differentiation is a multifaceted and tightly controlled process required 
for the formation of skeletal muscle fibers. Satellite cells are the direct
cellular contributors to muscle repair in injuries or disorders. Here, we show
that autotaxin (Atx) expression and activity is required for satellite cell
differentiation. Conditional ablation of Atx or its pharmacological inhibition
impairs muscle repair. Mechanistically, we identify LPAR1 as the key receptor in 
Atx-LPA signaling. Myogenic gene array and pathway analysis identified that
Atx-LPA signaling activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), an mTOR-dependent 
master regulator of muscle cell growth via LPAR1. Furthermore, Atx transgenic
mice show muscle hypertrophic effects and accelerated regeneration. Intramuscular
injections of Atx/LPA show muscle hypertrophy. In addition, the regulatory
effects of Atx on differentiation are conserved in human myoblasts. This study
identifies Atx as a critical master regulator in murine and human muscles,
identifying a promising extracellular ligand in muscle formation, regeneration,
and hypertrophy.

Type I interferons (IFNs) induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in
response to viral infection. Induction of these ISGs must be regulated for an
efficient and controlled antiviral response, but post-transcriptional controls of
these genes have not been well defined. Here, we identify a role for the RNA base
modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of ISGs. Using ribosome
profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, coupled with
m6A-immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we identify a subset of ISGs, including
IFITM1, whose translation is enhanced by m6A and the m6A methyltransferase
proteins METTL3 and METTL14. We further determine that the m6A reader YTHDF1
increases the expression of IFITM1 in an m6A-binding-dependent manner.
Importantly, we find that the m6A methyltransferase complex promotes the
antiviral activity of type I IFN. Thus, these studies identify m6A as having a
role in post-transcriptional control of ISG translation during the type I IFN
response for antiviral restriction.

Cancer cells use actin-based membrane protrusions, invadopodia, to degrade stroma
and invade. In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), the endothelin A receptor (ETAR)
drives invadopodia by a not fully explored coordinated function of β-arrestin1
(β-arr1). Here, we report that β-arr1 links the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/βPIX
complex to activate Rac3 GTPase, acting as a central node in the adhesion-based
extracellular matrix (ECM) sensing and degradation. Downstream, Rac3
phosphorylates PAK1 and cofilin and promotes invadopodium-dependent ECM
proteolysis and invasion. Furthermore, ETAR/ILK/Rac3 signaling supports the
communication between cancer and mesothelial cells, favoring SOC cell adhesion
and transmigration. In vivo, ambrisentan, an ETAR antagonist, inhibits the
adhesion and spreading of tumor cells to intraperitoneal organs, and invadopodium
marker expression. As prognostic factors, high EDNRA/ILK expression correlates
with poor SOC clinical outcome. These findings provide a framework for the
ET-1R/β-arr1 pathway as an integrator of ILK/Rac3-dependent adhesive and
proteolytic signaling to invadopodia, favoring cancer/stroma interactions and
metastatic behavior.

Comment in
    Cell Calcium. 2021 Sep;98:102438.

Calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria is a
critical contributor to apoptosis. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ovarian killer (BOK)
localizes to the ER and binds the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosophate receptor (IP3R). 
Here, we show that BOK is necessary for baseline mitochondrial calcium levels and
stimulus-induced calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Murine
embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BOK have decreased proximity of the ER to the
mitochondria and altered protein composition of mitochondria-associated membranes
(MAMs), which form essential calcium microdomains. Rescue of the ER-mitochondrial
juxtaposition with drug-inducible interorganelle linkers reveals a kinetic
disruption, which when overcome in Bok-/- cells is still insufficient to rescue
thapsigargin-induced calcium transfer and apoptosis. Likewise, a BOK mutant
unable to interact with IP3R restores ER-mitochondrial proximity, but not
ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer, MAM protein composition, or apoptosis. This
work identifies the dynamic coordination of ER-mitochondrial contact by BOK as an
important control point for apoptosis.

Loss of integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins can
trigger a variety of cellular changes that affect cell viability. Foremost among 
these is the activation of anoikis, caspase-mediated cell death induced by ECM
detachment. In addition, loss of ECM attachment causes profound alterations in
cellular metabolism, which can lead to anoikis-independent cell death. Here, we
describe a surprising role for serum and glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1) in the
promotion of energy production when cells are detached. Our data demonstrate that
SGK1 activation is necessary and sufficient for ATP generation during ECM
detachment and anchorage-independent growth. More specifically, SGK1 promotes a
substantial elevation in glucose uptake because of elevated GLUT1 transcription. 
In addition, carbon flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is necessary to
accommodate elevated glucose uptake and PPP-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
(G3P) is necessary for ATP production. Thus, our data show SGK1 as master
regulator of glucose metabolism and cell survival during ECM-detached conditions.

Rab1A is a small GTPase known for its role in vesicular trafficking. Recent
evidence indicates that Rab1A is essential for amino acids (aas) sensing and
signaling to regulate mTORC1 in normal and cancer cells. However, Rab1A's in vivo
function in mammals is not known. Here, we report the generation of tamoxifen
(TAM)-induced whole body Rab1A knockout (Rab1A-/-) in adult mice. Rab1A-/- mice
are viable but become hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant due to impaired
insulin transcription and β-cell proliferation and maintenance. Mechanistically, 
Rab1A mediates AA-mTORC1 signaling, particularly branched chain amino acids
(BCAA), to regulate the stability and localization of the insulin transcription
factor Pdx1. Collectively, these results reveal a physiological role of
aa-Rab1A-mTORC1 signaling in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis in
mammals. Intriguingly, Rab1A expression is reduced in β-cells of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) patients, which is correlated with loss of insulin expression, suggesting
that Rab1A downregulation contributes to T2D progression.

Senescent cells trigger their own immune-mediated destruction, termed senescence 
surveillance. This is dependent on the inflammatory senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP), which includes COX2, an enzyme with complex roles in 
cancer. The role COX2 plays during senescence surveillance is unknown. Here, we
show that during RAS-induced senescence (RIS), COX2 is a critical regulator of
SASP composition and senescence surveillance in vivo. COX2 regulates the
expression of multiple inflammatory SASP components through an autocrine feedback
loop involving its downstream product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), binding to EP4.
During in vivo hepatocyte RIS, Cox2 is critical to tumor suppression, Cxcl1
expression, and immune-mediated senescence surveillance, partially through PGE2. 
Loss of Cox2 in RIS dysregulates the intrahepatic immune microenvironment, with
enrichment of immunosuppressive immature myeloid cells and CD4+ regulatory T
lymphocytes. Therefore, COX2 and PGE2 play a critical role in senescence, shaping
SASP composition, promoting senescence surveillance and tumor suppression in the 
earliest stages of tumorigenesis.

Although many of the factors, epigenetic changes, and cell cycle stages that
distinguish repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination
(HR) from non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are known, the underlying mechanisms 
that determine pathway choice are incompletely understood. Previously, we found
that the transcription factor Sp1 is recruited to DSBs and is necessary for
repair. Here, we demonstrate that Sp1 localizes to DSBs in G1 and is necessary
for recruitment of the NHEJ repair factor, 53BP1. Phosphorylation of Sp1-S59 in
early S phase evicts Sp1 and 53BP1 from the break site; inhibition of that
phosphorylation results in 53BP1 and Sp1 remaining at DSBs in S phase cells,
precluding BRCA1 binding and suppressing HR. Expression of Sp1-S59A increases
sensitivity of BRCA1+/+ cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition
similar to BRCA1 deficiency. These data demonstrate how Sp1 integrates the cell
cycle and DSB repair pathway choice to favor NHEJ.

Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to the RING-between-RING family.
Mutations in the Parkin-encoding gene PARK2 are associated with familial
Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigate the interplay between Parkin and the
inflammatory cytokine-induced ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10. FAT10 targets
hundreds of proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. We show that FAT10
gets conjugated to Parkin and mediates its degradation in a proteasome-dependent 
manner. Parkin binds to the E2 enzyme of FAT10 (USE1), auto-FAT10ylates itself,
and facilitates FAT10ylation of the Parkin substrate Mitofusin2 in vitro and in
cells, thus identifying Parkin as a FAT10 E3 ligase. On mitochondrial
depolarization, FAT10ylation of Parkin inhibits its activation and
ubiquitin-ligase activity causing impairment of mitophagy progression and
aggravation of rotenone-mediated death of dopaminergic neuronal cells. In
conclusion, FAT10ylation inhibits Parkin and mitophagy rendering FAT10 a likely
inflammation-induced exacerbating factor and potential drug target for
Parkinson's disease.

ATP-competitive inhibitors have been developed as promising anti-cancer agents.
However, drug-resistance frequently occurs, and the underlying mechanisms are not
fully understood. Here, we show that the activation of c-Src and its downstream
phosphorylation cascade can be paradoxically induced by Src-targeted and
RTK-targeted kinase inhibitors. We reveal that inhibitor binding induces a
conformational change in c-Src, leading to the association of the active form
c-Src with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Reduction of the inhibitor concentration 
results in the dissociation of inhibitors from the c-Src-FAK complex, which
allows c-Src to phosphorylate FAK and initiate FAK-Grb2-mediated Erk signaling.
Furthermore, a drug-resistant mutation in c-Src, which reduces the affinity of
inhibitors for c-Src, converts Src inhibitors into facilitators of cell
proliferation by enhancing the phosphorylation of FAK and Erk in c-Src-mutated
cells. Our data thus reveal paradoxical enhancement of cell growth evoked by
target-based kinase inhibitors, providing potentially important clues for the
future development of effective and safe cancer treatment.

The breast cancer type I susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and BRCA1-associated RING
domain protein I (BARD1) heterodimer promote genome integrity through pleiotropic
functions, including DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous
recombination (HR). BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization is required for their mutual
stability, HR function, and role in tumor suppression; however, the upstream
signaling events governing BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization are unclear. Here, we
show that SIRT2, a sirtuin deacetylase and breast tumor suppressor, promotes
BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization through deacetylation. SIRT2 complexes with
BRCA1-BARD1 and deacetylates conserved lysines in the BARD1 RING domain,
interfacing BRCA1, which promotes BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization and consequently
BRCA1-BARD1 stability, nuclear retention, and localization to DNA damage sites,
thus contributing to efficient HR. Our findings define a mechanism for regulation
of BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization through SIRT2 deacetylation, elucidating a
critical upstream signaling event directing BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimerization, which
facilitates HR and tumor suppression, and delineating a role for SIRT2 in
directing DSB repair by HR.

Flux through the RAF-MEK-ERK protein kinase cascade is shaped by phosphatases
acting on the core components of the pathway. Despite being an established drug
target and a hub for crosstalk regulation, little is known about
dephosphorylation of MEK, the central kinase within the cascade. Here, we
identify PPP6C, a phosphatase frequently mutated or downregulated in melanoma, as
a major MEK phosphatase in cells exhibiting oncogenic ERK pathway activation.
Recruitment of MEK to PPP6C occurs through an interaction with its associated
regulatory subunits. Loss of PPP6C causes hyperphosphorylation of MEK at
activating and crosstalk phosphorylation sites, promoting signaling through the
ERK pathway and decreasing sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Recurrent
melanoma-associated PPP6C mutations cause MEK hyperphosphorylation, suggesting
that they promote disease at least in part by activating the core oncogenic
pathway driving melanoma. Collectively, our studies identify a key negative
regulator of ERK signaling that may influence susceptibility to targeted cancer
therapies.

The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex detects and processes DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs). Its DNA binding and processing activities are regulated by transitions
between an ATP-bound state and a post-hydrolysis cutting state that is
nucleolytically active. Mre11 endonuclease activity is stimulated by Sae2, whose 
lack increases MRX persistence at DSBs and checkpoint activation. Here we show
that the Rif2 protein inhibits Mre11 endonuclease activity and is responsible for
the increased MRX retention at DSBs in sae2Δ cells. We identify a Rad50 residue
that is important for Rad50-Rif2 interaction and Rif2 inhibition of Mre11
nuclease. This residue is located near a Rad50 surface that binds Sae2 and is
important in stabilizing the Mre11-Rad50 (MR) interaction in the cutting state.
We propose that Sae2 stimulates Mre11 endonuclease activity by stabilizing a
post-hydrolysis MR conformation that is competent for DNA cleavage, whereas Rif2 
antagonizes this Sae2 function and stabilizes an endonuclease inactive MR
conformation.

Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received
considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal brain maturation are
less understood. Here, we identify the miR-29 family to be strikingly induced
during the late stages of brain maturation. Brain maturation is associated with a
transient, postnatal period of de novo non-CG (CH) DNA methylation mediated by
DNMT3A. We examine whether an important function of miR-29 during brain
maturation is to restrict the period of CH methylation via its targeting of
Dnmt3a. Deletion of miR-29 in the brain, or knockin mutations preventing miR-29
to specifically target Dnmt3a, result in increased DNMT3A expression, higher CH
methylation, and repression of genes associated with neuronal activity and
neuropsychiatric disorders. These mouse models also develop neurological deficits
and premature lethality. Our results identify an essential role for miR-29 in
restricting CH methylation in the brain and illustrate the importance of CH
methylation regulation for normal brain maturation.

The colon epithelium is a primary point of interaction with the microbiome and is
regenerated by a few rapidly cycling colonic stem cells (CSCs). CSC self-renewal 
and proliferation are regulated by growth factors and the presence of bacteria.
However, the molecular link connecting the diverse inputs that maintain CSC
homeostasis remains largely unknown. We report that CSC proliferation is mediated
by redox-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling via NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1). NOX1 expression is CSC specific and is
restricted to proliferative CSCs. In the absence of NOX1, CSCs fail to generate
ROS and have a reduced proliferation rate. NOX1 expression is regulated by
Toll-like receptor activation in response to the microbiota and serves to link
CSC proliferation with the presence of bacterial components in the crypt. The
TLR-NOX1-EGFR axis is therefore a critical redox signaling node in CSCs
facilitating the quiescent-proliferation transition and responds to the
microbiome to maintain colon homeostasis.

The huntingtin (HTT) protein transports various organelles, including vesicles
containing neurotrophic factors, from embryonic development throughout life. To
better understand how HTT mediates axonal transport and why this function is
disrupted in Huntington's disease (HD), we study vesicle-associated HTT and find 
that it is dimethylated at a highly conserved arginine residue (R118) by the
protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6). Without R118 methylation, HTT
associates less with vesicles, anterograde trafficking is diminished, and
neuronal death ensues-very similar to what occurs in HD. Inhibiting PRMT6 in HD
cells and neurons exacerbates mutant HTT (mHTT) toxicity and impairs axonal
trafficking, whereas overexpressing PRMT6 restores axonal transport and neuronal 
viability, except in the presence of a methylation-defective variant of mHTT. In 
HD flies, overexpressing PRMT6 rescues axonal defects and eclosion. Arginine
methylation thus regulates HTT-mediated vesicular transport along the axon, and
increasing HTT methylation could be of therapeutic interest for HD.

Several neurodegenerative diseases present Tau accumulation as the main
pathological marker. Tau post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation
and acetylation are increased in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that Tau
hyper-acetylation at residue 174 increases its own nuclear presence and is the
result of DNA damage signaling or the lack of SIRT6, both causative of
neurodegeneration. Tau-K174ac is deacetylated in the nucleus by SIRT6. However,
lack of SIRT6 or chronic DNA damage results in nuclear Tau-K174ac accumulation.
Once there, it induces global changes in gene expression, affecting protein
translation, synthesis, and energy production. Concomitantly, Alzheimer's disease
(AD) case subjects show increased nucleolin and a decrease in SIRT6 levels. AD
case subjects present increased levels of nuclear Tau, particularly Tau-K174ac.
Our results suggest that increased Tau-K174ac in AD case subjects is the result
of DNA damage signaling and SIRT6 depletion. We propose that Tau-K174ac toxicity 
is due to its increased stability, nuclear accumulation, and nucleolar
dysfunction.

Comment in
    Autophagy. 2021 Jul;17(7):1791-1793.

The primary cilium (PC) regulates signalization linked to external stress
sensing. Previous works established a functional interplay between the PC and the
autophagic machinery. When ciliogenesis is promoted by serum deprivation, the
autophagy protein ATG16L1 and the ciliary protein IFT20 are co-transported to the
PC. Here, we demonstrate that IFT20 and ATG16L1 are part of the same complex
requiring the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 and a Y-E-F-I motif in IFT20. We show that
ATG16L1-deficient cells exhibit aberrant ciliary structures, which accumulate
PI4,5P2, whereas PI4P, a lipid normally concentrated in the PC, is absent.
Finally, we demonstrate that INPP5E, a phosphoinositide-associated phosphatase
responsible for PI4P generation, interacts with ATG16L1 and that a perturbation
of the ATG16L1/IFT20 complex alters its trafficking to the PC. Altogether, our
results reveal a function of ATG16L1 in ciliary lipid and protein trafficking,
thus directly contributing to proper PC dynamics and functions.

MYC-driven medulloblastoma is a major therapeutic challenge due to frequent
metastasis and a poor 5-year survival rate. MYC gene amplification results in
transcriptional dysregulation, proliferation, and survival of malignant cells. To
identify therapeutic targets in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, we employ a
CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen targeting 1,140 genes. We identify CDK7 as a
mediator of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic 
depletion, we observe cessation of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models and
increases in apoptosis. The results are attributed to repression of a core set of
MYC-driven transcriptional programs mediating DNA repair. CDK7 inhibition alters 
RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and MYC association at DNA repair genes. Blocking 
CDK7 activity sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation leading to accrual of DNA
damage, extending survival and tumor latency in xenograft mouse models. Our
studies establish the selective inhibition of MYC-driven medulloblastoma by CDK7 
inhibition combined with radiation as a viable therapeutic strategy.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING
FACTOR 7 (PIF7) is a central regulator that promotes stem growth by activating
growth-related gene expression during shade-avoidance responses. Studying the
co-factors of PIF7 can facilitate understanding of the mechanism of PIFs and
light signal transduction. Here, we describe the identification of two bHLH
transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60 (bHLH48/bHLH60), as essential partners
for PIF7-dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation and function downstream of 
phytochrome B. These two bHLH factors display DNA binding activity and interact
with PIF7. Genetic analysis indicated that bHLH48/bHLH60 and PIF7 are
interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified the substantially overlapping
downstream targets of bHLH60 and PIF7. Biochemical analysis revealed that
bHLH48/bHLH60 enhance the DNA binding ability of PIF7. These results provide
evidence that bHLH48/bHLH60 act as positive partners of PIF7 for mutual benefit

mTOR, the sensor of nutrients and growth factors, has important roles in tissue
homeostasis and tumorigenesis. However, how mTOR controls gastric epithelial cell
turnover and gastric cancer development, a leading malignancy, remains poorly
understood. Here, we provide genetic evidence that mTOR activation promotes
proliferation and inhibits differentiation of Lgr5+ gastric epithelial
progenitors (GEPs) in gastric homeostasis and tumorigenesis. mTOR signaling
increases MEK1 and Smad1 expression and enhances activation of MEK1-ERKs and
BMP-Smad1 pathways, respectively, in GEPs and gastric tumors. Mek1 deletion or
inhibition rescues hyperproliferation, whereas Bmpr1a ablation or inhibition
rescues differentiation defects of Tsc1-/- GEPs. Tsc1 deficiency in Lgr5+ GEPs
accelerates gastric tumor initiation and development, which require MEK1-ERKs for
hyperplasia and BMP-Smad1 for differentiation suppression. These findings reveal 
how mTOR signaling controls Lgr5+ GEP homeostasis and cancerization and suggest
that ERKs and Smad1 signaling can be safely targeted to substitute mTOR
inhibitors in gastric cancer therapy.

Dicotyledonous plants form an apical hook to protect the fragile apical meristem 
during upward protrusion from the soil. Etiolated pifq (pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5)
seedlings display constitutive apical hook opening. Here, we show that PIF
proteins control apical hook opening by regulating the expression of Budding
Uninhibited by Benzimidazole 3.1 (BUB3.1) and affecting cytokinesis. Consistent
with the major function of BUB3.1 in the organization of phragmoplasts during
cytokinesis, the phragmoplasts are well formed in dark-grown pifq but not in wild
type. DNA staining and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrate that cellular 
endoreduplication levels are dramatically reduced in pifq. Chemical treatment
with caffeine, an inhibitor of phragmoplast-based cytokinesis, shows that
cytokinesis is involved in the apical hook opening. Genetically, BUB3.1 is
epistatic to PIFq in the regulation of cytokinesis. Our findings reveal an
organ-specific role of PIF proteins in regulating cytokinesis by BUB3.1 during
apical hook development.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control critical aspects of cardiomyocyte function,
but the repertoire of active RBPs in cardiomyocytes during the growth response is
largely unknown. We define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a
system-wide level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67
cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs, including several contractile proteins. Furthermore,
we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as 
a dynamic RBP, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. We identify
mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4 in cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac 
remodeling by differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4
target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) are
discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the expression of these mRNAs and that
Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as a critical
regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding to specific mRNAs in 
response to pathological growth stimulation.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder, with impaired brain
development caused by mutations in MECP2; however, the underlying mechanism
remains elusive. We know from previous work that MeCP2 facilitates the processing
of a specific microRNA, miR-199a, by associating with the Drosha complex to
regulate neuronal functions. Here, we show that the MeCP2/miR-199a axis regulates
neural stem/precursor cell (NS/PC) differentiation. A shift occurs from neuronal 
to astrocytic differentiation of MeCP2- and miR-199a-deficient NS/PCs due to the 
upregulation of a miR-199a target, Smad1, a downstream transcription factor of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Moreover, miR-199a expression and
treatment with BMP inhibitors rectify the differentiation of RTT patient-derived 
NS/PCs and development of brain organoids, respectively, suggesting that
facilitation of BMP signaling accounts for the impaired RTT brain development.
Our study illuminates the molecular pathology of RTT and reveals the
MeCP2/miR-199a/Smad1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for RTT.

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles subjected to fission and fusion
events. During mitosis, mitochondrial fission ensures equal distribution of
mitochondria to daughter cells. If and how this process can actively drive
mitotic progression remains largely unknown. Here, we discover a pathway linking 
mitochondrial fission to mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The
mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), the main mitochondrial receptor for the
Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is directly phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D 
(PKD) specifically during mitosis. PKD-dependent MFF phosphorylation is required 
and sufficient for mitochondrial fission in mitotic but not in interphasic cells.
Phosphorylation of MFF is crucial for chromosome segregation and promotes cell
survival by inhibiting adaptation of the mitotic checkpoint. Thus,
PKD/MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission is critical for the maintenance of genome
integrity during cell division.

Increased vascular permeability and leakage are hallmarks of several pathologies 
and determine disease progression and severity by facilitating
inflammatory/metastatic cell infiltration. Using tissue-specific genetic ablation
in endothelial cells, we have investigated in vivo the role of Tumor progression 
locus 2 (Tpl2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) member
with pleiotropic effects in inflammation and cancer. In response to
proinflammatory stimuli, endothelial Tpl2 deletion alters tight junction
claudin-5 protein expression through inhibition of JNK signaling and lysosomal
degradation activation, resulting in reduced vascular permeability and immune
cell infiltration. This results in significantly attenuated disease scores in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and fewer tumor nodules in a
hematogenic lung cancer metastasis model. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition
of Tpl2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Tpl2 knockdown recapitulates
our findings and reduces lung metastatic tumor invasions. These results establish
an endothelial-specific role for Tpl2 and highlight the therapeutic potential of 
blocking the endothelial-specific Tpl2 pathway in chronic inflammatory and
metastatic diseases.

Autophagy dysregulation is implicated in metabolic diseases, including type 2
diabetes. However, the mechanism by which the autophagy machinery regulates
metabolism is largely unknown. Autophagy is generally considered a degradation
process via lysosomes. Here, we unveil a metabolically important
non-cell-autonomous, non-degradative mechanism regulated by the essential
autophagy protein Becn1 in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet challenge,
autophagy-hyperactive Becn1F121A mice show systemically improved insulin
sensitivity and enhanced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a
central regulator of energy homeostasis, via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism
mediated by adiponectin, an adipose-derived metabolic hormone. Adipose-specific
Becn1F121A expression is sufficient to activate AMPK in non-adipose tissues and
improve systemic insulin sensitivity by increasing adiponectin secretion.
Further, Becn1 enhances adiponectin secretion by interacting with components of
the exocyst complex via the coiled-coil domain. Together, our study demonstrates 
that Becn1 improves insulin sensitivity by facilitating adiponectin secretion
through binding the exocyst in adipose tissue.

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) regulate the occurrence of obesity and its
related diseases. Here, we found that serine/threonine protein kinase 24 (Stk24) 
expression is downregulated significantly in ATMs in obese subjects or obese
subjects with type 2 diabetes and mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We further
identified that glucolipotoxicity downregulated Stk24 expression in ATMs.
Stk24-deficient mice develop severe HFD-induced metabolic disorders and insulin
insensitivity. Mechanistically, Stk24 intervenes in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly
in ATMs by associating directly with NLRP3, decreasing interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
secretion. Accordingly, Stk24 deficiency in the hematopoietic system promotes
NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which contributes to exacerbation of metabolic
disorders. Intriguingly, Stk24 expression correlates negatively with body mass
index (BMI) and the levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and
low-density lipoprotein in human subjects. These findings provide insights into
the function and clinical implications of Stk24 in obesity-mediated metabolic
disorders.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction
of pancreatic β cells. We show here that the protein NOD-like receptor family
pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) has a key role in the pathogenesis of mouse and
human T1D. More specifically, downregulation of NLRP1 expression occurs during T 
helper 17 (Th17) differentiation, alongside greater expression of several
molecules related to Th17 cell differentiation in a signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway. These changes lead to a 
consequent increase in interleukin 17 (IL-17) production within the pancreas and 
higher incidence of diabetes in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice. Finally, in
patients with T1D and a SNP (rs12150220) in NLRP1, there is a robust decrease in 
IL-17 levels in serum and in memory Th17 cells from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells. Our results demonstrate that NLRP1 acts as a negative regulator of the
Th17 cell polarization program, making it an interesting target for intervention 
during the early stages of T1D.

Cancer immunotherapy focuses on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, such as
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Unlike RAS-mutated lung cancers, EGFR mutant
tumors have a generally low response to immunotherapy. Because treatment outcomes
vary by EGFR allele, intrinsic and microenvironmental factors may be involved.
Among all non-immunological signaling pathways surveyed in patients' datasets,
EGFR signaling is best associated with high PD-L1. Correspondingly, active EGFRs 
stabilize PD-L1 transcripts and depletion of PD-L1 severely inhibits EGFR-driven 
tumorigenicity and metastasis in mice. The underlying mechanisms involve the
recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) to a cytoplasmic motif of PD-L1, which
enhances PLC-γ1 activation by EGFR. Once stimulated, PLC-γ1 activates calcium
flux, Rho GTPases, and protein kinase C, collectively promoting an aggressive
phenotype. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies can inhibit these intrinsic functions of PD-L1. 
Our results portray PD-L1 as a molecular amplifier of EGFR signaling and improve 
the understanding of the resistance of EGFR+ tumors to immunotherapy.

Maintaining a suitable level of sensitivity to environmental cues is crucial for 
proper function of adult stem cells. Here, we explore how the intrinsic
sensitivity of skin hair follicle (HF) progenitors to growth stimuli is
dynamically regulated. We discover miR-24 is an miRNA whose expression in HF
progenitors inversely correlates with their growth potency in vivo. We show that 
its upregulation in adult skin epithelium leads to blunted responses of HF
progenitors to growth cues and retards hair regeneration, while its conditional
ablation leads to hyper-sensitized growth responsiveness of HF progenitors and
precocious hair regeneration. Mechanistically, we find that miR-24 limits the
intrinsic growth competence of HF progenitor by directly targeting Plk3, whose
downregulation leads to reduced expression of CCNE1, a key cyclin for cell-cycle 
entry. These findings reveal an miRNA-mediated dynamic and cell-intrinsic
mechanism used by HF progenitors to adapt their regenerative competence for
different physiological conditions.

Succinate functions both as a classical TCA cycle metabolite and an extracellular
metabolic stress signal sensed by the mainly Gi-coupled succinate receptor
SUCNR1. In the present study, we characterize and compare effects and signaling
pathways activated by succinate and both classes of non-metabolite SUCNR1
agonists. By use of specific receptor and pathway inhibitors, rescue in
G-protein-depleted cells and monitoring of receptor G protein activation by BRET,
we identify Gq rather than Gi signaling to be responsible for SUCNR1-mediated
effects on basic transcriptional regulation. Importantly, in primary human M2
macrophages, in which SUCNR1 is highly expressed, we demonstrate that
physiological concentrations of extracellular succinate act through
SUCNR1-activated Gq signaling to efficiently regulate transcription of immune
function genes in a manner that hyperpolarizes their M2 versus M1 phenotype.
Thus, sensing of stress-induced extracellular succinate by SUCNR1 is an important
transcriptional regulator in human M2 macrophages through Gq signaling.

MYC activates different metabolic programs in a cell-type- and
cell-status-dependent manner. However, the role of MYC in inflammatory
macrophages has not yet been determined. Metabolic and molecular analyses reveal 
that MYC, but not hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), is involved in enhancing
early glycolytic flux during inflammatory macrophage polarization. Ablation of
MYC decreases lactate production by regulating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
activity and causes increased inflammatory cytokines by regulating interferon
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in response to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover,
myeloid-specific deletion of MYC and pharmacological inhibition of the MYC/LDH
axis enhance inflammation and the bacterial clearance in vivo. These results
elucidate the potential role of the MYC/LDH/IRF4 axis in inflammatory macrophages
by connecting early glycolysis with inflammatory responses and suggest that
modulating early glycolytic flux mediated by the MYC/LDH axis can be used to open
avenues for the therapeutic modulation of macrophage polarization to fight
against bacterial infection.

Obesity has become a global pandemic. Identification of key factors in
adipogenesis helps to tackle obesity and related metabolic diseases. Here, we
show that DDB1 binds the histone reader BRWD3 to promote adipogenesis and
diet-induced obesity. Although typically recognized as a component of the
CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, DDB1 stimulates adipogenesis independently
of CUL4. A DDB1 mutant that does not bind CUL4A or CUL4B fully restores
adipogenesis in DDB1-deficient cells. Ddb1+/- mice show delayed postnatal
development of white adipose tissues and are protected from diet-induced obesity.
Mechanistically, by interacting with BRWD3, DDB1 is recruited to acetylated
histones in the proximal promoters of ELK1 downstream immediate early response
genes and facilitates the release of paused RNA polymerase II, thereby activating
the transcriptional cascade in adipogenesis. Our findings have uncovered a
CUL4-independent function of DDB1 in promoting the transcriptional cascade of
adipogenesis, development of adipose tissues, and onset of obesity.

Developing neurons initially form excessive neurites and then remodel them based 
on molecular cues and neuronal activity. Developing mitral cells in the olfactory
bulb initially extend multiple primary dendrites. They then stabilize single
primary dendrites while eliminating others. However, the mechanisms underlying
selective dendrite remodeling remain elusive. Using CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout
screening combined with in utero electroporation, we identify BMPR-2 as a key
regulator for selective dendrite stabilization. Bmpr2 knockout and its rescue
experiments show that BMPR-2 inhibits LIMK without ligands and thereby permits
dendrite destabilization. In contrast, the overexpression of antagonists and
agonists indicates that ligand-bound BMPR-2 stabilizes dendrites, most likely by 
releasing LIMK. Using genetic and FRET imaging experiments, we demonstrate that
free LIMK is activated by NMDARs via Rac1, facilitating dendrite stabilization
through F-actin formation. Thus, the selective stabilization of primary dendrites
is ensured by concomitant inputs of BMP ligands and neuronal activity.

The type I interferon (IFN) pathway is a key component of innate immune response 
upon invasion of foreign pathogens. It is also under precise control to prevent
excessive upregulation and undesired inflammation cascade. In the present study, 
we report that Riok3, an atypical kinase, negatively regulates retinoic
acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) sensing-induced type I IFN
signaling. Riok3 deficiency selectively inhibits RNA viral replication in vitro, 
resulting from an upregulated type I IFN pathway. Mice with myeloid-specific
Riok3 knockout also show a more robust induction of type I IFN upon RNA virus
infection and are more resistant to RNA virus-induced pathogenesis.
Mechanistically, Riok3 recruits and interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase
TRIM40, leading to the degradation of RIG-I and melanoma
differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) via K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination. 
Collectively, our data reveal the mechanism that Riok3 employs to be a negative
regulator of antiviral innate immunity.

RNA helicases play critical roles in various biological processes, including
serving as viral RNA sensors in innate immunity. Here, we find that RNA helicase 
DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-β),
type III IFN (IFN-λ3), and inflammasome-derived cytokine IL-18 production by
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in response to poly I:C and RNA viruses with
preference of enteric RNA viruses, but not DNA virus. Importantly, we generate
IEC-specific Dhx15-knockout mice and demonstrate that DHX15 is required for
controlling intestinal inflammation induced by enteric RNA virus rotavirus in
suckling mice and reovirus in adult mice in vivo, which owes to impaired IFN-β,
IFN-λ3, and IL-18 production in IECs from Dhx15-deficient mice. Mechanistically, 
DHX15 interacts with NLRP6 to trigger NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation 
for inducing IL-18 secretion in IECs. Collectively, our report reveals critical
roles for DHX15 in sensing enteric RNA viruses in IECs and controlling intestinal
inflammation.

53BP1 is recruited to chromatin in the vicinity of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs). We identify the nuclear kinesin, KIF18B, as a 53BP1-interacting protein
and define its role in 53BP1-mediated DSB repair. KIF18B is a molecular motor
protein involved in destabilizing astral microtubules during mitosis. It is
primarily nuclear throughout the interphase and is constitutively chromatin
bound. Our observations indicate a nuclear function during the interphase for a
kinesin previously implicated in mitosis. We identify a central motif in KIF18B, 
which we term the Tudor-interacting motif (TIM), because of its interaction with 
the Tudor domain of 53BP1. TIM enhances the interaction between the 53BP1 Tudor
domain and dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4. TIM and the motor function of
KIF18B are both required for efficient 53BP1 focal recruitment in response to
damage and for fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. Our data suggest a role for
KIF18B in efficient 53BP1-mediated end-joining of DSBs.

The contribution of adipose-derived FGF21 to energy homeostasis is unclear. Here 
we show that browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) by β-adrenergic
agonists requires autocrine FGF21 signaling. Adipose-specific deletion of the
FGF21 co-receptor β-Klotho renders mice unresponsive to β-adrenergic stimulation.
In contrast, mice with liver-specific ablation of FGF21, which eliminates
circulating FGF21, remain sensitive to β-adrenergic browning of iWAT.
Concordantly, transgenic overexpression of FGF21 in adipocytes promotes browning 
in a β-Klotho-dependent manner without increasing circulating FGF21.
Mechanistically, we show that β-adrenergic stimulation of thermogenic gene
expression requires FGF21 in adipocytes to promote phosphorylation of
phospholipase C-γ and mobilization of intracellular calcium. Moreover, we find
that the β-adrenergic-dependent increase in circulating FGF21 occurs through an
indirect mechanism in which fatty acids released by adipocyte lipolysis
subsequently activate hepatic PPARα to increase FGF21 expression. These studies
identify FGF21 as a cell-autonomous autocrine regulator of adipose tissue
function.

To identify therapeutic targets for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, we conduct a
druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen and determine that
suppression of BCAR1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK inhibition.
Integrative analysis of genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens also identify BCAR1 as a
top synthetic lethal interactor with mutant KRAS. BCAR1 encodes the SRC substrate
p130Cas. We determine that SRC-inhibitor-mediated suppression of p130Cas
phosphorylation impairs MYC transcription through a
DOCK1-RAC1-β-catenin-dependent mechanism. Additionally, genetic suppression of
TUBB3, encoding the βIII-tubulin subunit of microtubules, or pharmacological
inhibition of microtubule function decreases levels of MYC protein in a
calpain-dependent manner and potently sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to ERK
inhibition. Accordingly, the combination of a dual SRC/tubulin inhibitor with an 
ERK inhibitor cooperates to reduce MYC protein and synergistically suppress the
growth of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer. Thus, we demonstrate that
mechanistically diverse combinations with ERK inhibition suppress MYC to impair
pancreatic cancer proliferation.

The low level of transcytosis is a unique feature of cerebrovascular endothelial 
cells (ECs), ensuring restrictive blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Major
facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (MFSD2A) is a key regulator of the
BBB function by suppressing caveolae-mediated transcytosis. However, the
mechanisms regulating MFSD2A at the BBB have been barely explored. Here, we show 
that cerebrovascular EC-specific deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin
homolog) results in a dramatic increase in vesicular transcytosis by the
reduction of MFSD2A, leading to increased transcellular permeability of the BBB. 
Mechanistically, AKT signaling inhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2-mediated
MFSD2A degradation. Consistently, cerebrovascular Nedd4-2 overexpression
decreases MFSD2A levels, increases transcytosis, and impairs BBB permeability,
recapitulating the phenotypes of Pten-deficient mice. Furthermore, Akt deletion
decreases phosphorylated NEDD4-2 levels, restores MFSD2A levels, and normalizes
BBB permeability in Pten-mutant mice. Altogether, our work reveals the essential 
physiological function of the PTEN/AKT/NEDD4-2/MFSD2A axis in the regulation of
BBB permeability.

NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent Ca2+ influx underpins multiple forms of synaptic 
plasticity. Most synaptic NMDAR currents in the adult forebrain are mediated by
GluN2A-containing receptors, which are rapidly inserted into synapses during
long-term potentiation (LTP); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
poorly understood. In this study, we show that GluN2A is phosphorylated at
Ser-1459 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) in response to glycine
stimulation that mimics LTP in primary neurons. Phosphorylation of Ser-1459
promotes GluN2A interaction with the sorting nexin 27 (SNX27)-retromer complex,
thereby enhancing the endosomal recycling of NMDARs. Loss of SNX27 or CaMKIIα
function blocks the glycine-induced increase in GluN2A-NMDARs on the neuronal
membrane. Interestingly, mutations of Ser-1459, including the rare S1459G human
epilepsy variant, prolong the decay times of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in 
heterosynapses by increasing the duration of channel opening. These findings not 
only identify a critical role of Ser-1459 phosphorylation in regulating the
function of NMDARs, but they also explain how the S1459G variant dysregulates
NMDAR function.

Repair after traumatic injury often starts with mitotic activation around the
lesion edges. Early midline cells in the Drosophila embryonic CNS can enter into 
division following the traumatic disruption of microtubules. We demonstrate that 
microtubule disruption activates non-canonical TNF signaling by phosphorylation
of TGF-β activated kinase 1 (Tak1) and its target IkappaB kinase (Ik2),
culminating in Dorsal/NfkappaB nuclear translocation and Jra/Jun expression. Tak1
and Ik2 are necessary for the damaged-induced divisions. Microtubule disruption
caused by Tau accumulation is also reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human
Tau expression in Drosophila midline cells is sufficient to induce Tak1
phosphorylation, Dorsal and Jra/Jun expression, and entry into mitosis.
Interestingly, activation of Tak1 and Tank binding kinase 1 (Tbk1), the human Ik2
ortholog, and NfkappaB upregulation are observed in AD brains.

BAF chromatin remodeling complexes play important roles in chromatin regulation
and cancer. Here, we report that Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on the
autocrine signaling mediated by NELL2, a secreted glycoprotein that has been
characterized as an axon guidance molecule. NELL2 uses Robo3 as the receptor to
transmit critical growth signaling. NELL2 signaling inhibits cdc42 and
upregulates BAF complexes and EWS-FLI1 transcriptional output. We demonstrate
that cdc42 is a negative regulator of BAF complexes, inducing actin
polymerization and complex disassembly. Furthermore, we identify
NELL2highCD133highEWS-FLI1high and NELL2lowCD133lowEWS-FLI1low populations in
Ewing sarcoma, which display phenotypes consistent with high and low NELL2
signaling, respectively. We show that NELL2, CD133, and EWS-FLI1 positively
regulate each other and upregulate BAF complexes and cell proliferation in Ewing 
sarcoma. These results reveal a signaling pathway regulating critical chromatin
remodeling complexes and cancer cell proliferation.

The R2TP (RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RPAP3-PIH1D1) complex, in collaboration with heat shock
protein 90 (HSP90), functions as a chaperone for the assembly and stability of
protein complexes, including RNA polymerases, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
particles (snRNPs), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases (PIKKs)
such as TOR and SMG1. PIKK stabilization depends on an additional complex of
TELO2, TTI1, and TTI2 (TTT), whose structure and function are poorly understood. 
The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human R2TP-TTT complex,
together with biochemical experiments, reveals the mechanism of TOR recruitment
to the R2TP-TTT chaperone. The HEAT-repeat TTT complex binds the kinase domain of
TOR, without blocking its activity, and delivers TOR to the R2TP chaperone. In
addition, TTT regulates the R2TP chaperone by inhibiting RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase
activity and by modulating the conformation and interactions of the PIH1D1 and
RPAP3 components of R2TP. Taken together, our results show how TTT couples the
recruitment of TOR to R2TP with the regulation of this chaperone system.

MED20 is a non-essential subunit of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator
complex, but its physiological function remains largely unknown. Here, we
identify MED20 as a substrate of the anti-obesity CRL4-WDTC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
complex through affinity purification and candidate screening. Overexpression of 
WDTC1 leads to degradation of MED20, whereas depletion of WDTC1 or CUL4A/B causes
accumulation of MED20. Depleting MED20 inhibits adipogenesis, and a
non-degradable MED20 mutant restores adipogenesis in WDTC1-overexpressing cells. 
Furthermore, knockout of Med20 in preadipocytes abolishes development of brown
adipose tissues. Removing one allele of Med20 in preadipocytes protects mice from
diet-induced obesity and reverses weight gain in Cul4a- or Cul4b-depleted mice.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals that MED20
organizes the early adipogenic complex by bridging C/EBPβ and RNA polymerase II
to promote transcription of the central adipogenic factor, PPARγ. Our findings
have thus uncovered a critical role of MED20 in promoting adipogenesis,
development of adipose tissue and diet-induced obesity.

Mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is tightly regulated by a complex
network composed of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that allow proper organismal 
development. O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is the sole glycosylation 
mark found on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and plays a pivotal role in
regulating fundamental cellular processes; however, its function in ESC
pluripotency is still largely unexplored. Here, we identify O-GlcNAcylation of
proteasome activator subunit 3 (Psme3) protein as a node of the ESC pluripotency 
network. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAc modification of serine 111 (S111) of Psme3
promotes degradation of Ddx6, which is essential for processing body (P-body)
assembly, resulting in the maintenance of ESC pluripotent state. Conversely, loss
of Psme3 S111 O-GlcNAcylation stabilizes Ddx6 and increases P-body levels,
culminating in spontaneous exit of ESC from the pluripotent state. Our findings
establish O-GlcNAcylation at S111 of Psme3 as a switch that regulates ESC
pluripotency via control of P-body homeostasis.

Recombination activating genes (RAGs), consisting of RAG1 and RAG2, are
stringently regulated lymphoid-specific genes, which initiate V(D)J recombination
in developing lymphocytes. We report the regulation of RAG1 through a microRNA
(miRNA), miR-29c, in a B cell stage-specific manner in mice and humans. Various
lines of experimentation, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, demonstrate the
target specificity and direct interaction of miR-29c to RAG1. Modulation of
miR-29c levels leads to change in V(D)J recombination efficiency in pre-B cells. 
The miR-29c expression is inversely proportional to RAG1 in a B cell
developmental stage-specific manner, and miR-29c null mice exhibit a reduction in
mature B cells. A negative correlation of miR-29c and RAG1 levels is also
observed in leukemia patients, suggesting the potential use of miR-29c as a
biomarker and a therapeutic target. Thus, our results reveal the role of miRNA in
the regulation of RAG1 and its relevance in cancer.

Neuronal activity-induced enhancers drive gene activation. We demonstrate that
BRG1, the core subunit of SWI/SNF-like BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes, regulates neuronal activity-induced enhancers. Upon stimulation, BRG1 
is recruited to enhancers in an H3K27Ac-dependent manner. BRG1 regulates enhancer
basal activities and inducibility by affecting cohesin binding, enhancer-promoter
looping, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and enhancer RNA expression. We identify 
a serine phosphorylation site in BRG1 that is induced by neuronal stimulations
and is sensitive to CaMKII inhibition. BRG1 phosphorylation affects its
interaction with several transcription co-factors, including the NuRD repressor
complex and cohesin, possibly modulating BRG1-mediated transcription outcomes.
Using mice with knockin mutations, we show that non-phosphorylatable BRG1 fails
to efficiently induce activity-dependent genes, whereas phosphomimic BRG1
increases enhancer activity and inducibility. These mutant mice display
anxiety-like phenotypes and altered responses to stress. Therefore, we reveal a
mechanism connecting neuronal signaling to enhancer activities through BRG1
phosphorylation.

Proper lung function relies on the precise balance of specialized epithelial
cells that coordinate to maintain homeostasis. Herein, we describe essential
roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ in maintaining lung epithelial
homeostasis, reporting that conditional deletion of Yap and Wwtr1/Taz in the lung
epithelium of adult mice results in severe defects, including alveolar
disorganization and the development of airway mucin hypersecretion. Through
in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro molecular experiments, we reveal that
reduced YAP/TAZ activity promotes intrinsic goblet transdifferentiation of
secretory airway epithelial cells. Global gene expression and chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses suggest that YAP/TAZ act
cooperatively with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors and the NuRD complex
to suppress the goblet cell fate program, directly repressing the SPDEF gene.
Collectively, our study identifies YAP/TAZ as critical factors in lung epithelial
homeostasis and offers molecular insight into the mechanisms promoting goblet
cell differentiation, which is a hallmark of many lung diseases.

Upon nutrient stimulation, pre-adipocytes undergo differentiation to transform
into mature adipocytes capable of storing nutrients as fat. We profiled cellular 
metabolite consumption to identify early metabolic drivers of adipocyte
differentiation. We find that adipocyte differentiation raises the uptake and
consumption of numerous amino acids. In particular, branched-chain amino acid
(BCAA) catabolism precedes and promotes peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis. In early adipogenesis,
the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 elevates BCAA catabolism through the activation
of methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (MCCC). MCCC supports leucine
oxidation by catalyzing the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to
3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) expression is decreased in adipose
tissue of numerous diabetic mouse models, and its expression is most correlated
with BCAA enzymes, suggesting a potential role for SIRT4 in adipose pathology
through the alteration of BCAA metabolism. In summary, this work provides a
temporal analysis of adipocyte differentiation and uncovers early metabolic
events that stimulate transcriptional reprogramming.

The chloroplast is the main organelle for stress-induced production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). However, how chloroplastic ROS homeostasis is maintained
under salt stress is largely unknown. We show that EGY3, a gene encoding a
chloroplast-localized protein, is induced by salt and oxidative stresses. The
loss of EGY3 function causes stress hypersensitivity while EGY3 overexpression
increases the tolerance to both salt and chloroplastic oxidative stresses. EGY3
interacts with chloroplastic Cu/Zn-SOD2 (CSD2) and promotes CSD2 stability under 
stress conditions. In egy3-1 mutant plants, the stress-induced CSD2 degradation
limits H2O2 production in chloroplasts and impairs H2O2-mediated retrograde
signaling, as indicated by the decreased expression of
retrograde-signal-responsive genes required for stress tolerance. Both exogenous 
application of H2O2 (or APX inhibitor) and CSD2 overexpression can rescue the
salt-stress hypersensitivity of egy3-1 mutants. Our findings reveal that EGY3
enhances the tolerance to salt stress by promoting the CSD2 stability and
H2O2-mediated chloroplastic retrograde signaling.

Stable transmission of genetic material during cell division requires accurate
chromosome segregation. PLK1 dynamics at kinetochores control establishment of
correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments and subsequent silencing of the
spindle checkpoint. However, the regulatory mechanism responsible for PLK1
activity in prometaphase has not yet been affirmatively identified. Here we
identify Apolo1, which tunes PLK1 activity for accurate kinetochore-microtubule
attachments. Apolo1 localizes to kinetochores during early mitosis, and
suppression of Apolo1 results in misaligned chromosomes. Using the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PLK1 activity reporter, we found that
Apolo1 sustains PLK1 kinase activity at kinetochores for accurate attachment
during prometaphase. Apolo1 is a cognate substrate of PLK1, and the
phosphorylation enables PP1γ to inactivate PLK1 by dephosphorylation.
Mechanistically, Apolo1 constitutes a bridge between kinase and phosphatase,
which governs PLK1 activity in prometaphase. These findings define a previously
uncharacterized feedback loop by which Apolo1 provides fine-tuning for PLK1 to
guide chromosome segregation in mitosis.

Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for male fertility. Here, we
report that mouse SSC generation is driven by a transcription factor (TF) cascade
controlled by the homeobox protein, RHOX10, which acts by driving the
differentiation of SSC precursors called pro-spermatogonia (ProSG). We identify
genes regulated by RHOX10 in ProSG in vivo and define direct RHOX10-target genes 
using several approaches, including a rapid temporal induction assay: iSLAMseq.
Together, these approaches identify temporal waves of RHOX10 direct targets, as
well as RHOX10 secondary-target genes. Many of the RHOX10-regulated genes encode 
proteins with known roles in SSCs. Using an in vitro ProSG differentiation assay,
we find that RHOX10 promotes mouse ProSG differentiation through a conserved
transcriptional cascade involving the key germ-cell TFs DMRT1 and ZBTB16. Our
study gives important insights into germ cell development and provides a
blueprint for how to define TF cascades.

Many neurological disorders show an increased prevalence of GluA2-lacking,
Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), which dramatically alters synaptic
function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this distinct synaptic
plasticity remains enigmatic. Here, we show that nerve injury potentiates
postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, CP-AMPARs in the spinal dorsal horn via α2δ-1.
Overexpressing α2δ-1, previously regarded as a Ca2+ channel subunit, augments
CP-AMPAR levels at the cell surface and synapse. Mechanistically, α2δ-1
physically interacts with both GluA1 and GluA2 via its C terminus, inhibits the
GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly, and increases GluA2 retention in the
endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, α2δ-1 diminishes the availability and
synaptic expression of GluA1/GluA2 heterotetramers in the spinal cord in
neuropathic pain. Inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1-AMPAR 
complex fully restores the intracellular assembly and synaptic dominance of
heteromeric GluA1/GluA2 receptors. Thus, α2δ-1 is a pivotal AMPAR-interacting
protein that controls the subunit composition and Ca2+ permeability of
postsynaptic AMPARs.

Activity-dependent GABAergic synapse plasticity is important for normal brain
functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely
understood. Here, we show that Npas4 (neuronal PAS-domain protein 4)
transcriptionally regulates the expression of IQSEC3, a GABAergic
synapse-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor
(ARF-GEF) that directly interacts with gephyrin. Neuronal activation by an
enriched environment induces Npas4-mediated upregulation of IQSEC3 protein
specifically in CA1 stratum oriens layer somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic 
interneurons. SST+ interneuron-specific knockout (KO) of Npas4 compromises
synaptic transmission in these GABAergic interneurons, increases neuronal
activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and reduces anxiety behavior, all of which are
normalized by the expression of wild-type IQSEC3, but not a dominant-negative
ARF-GEF-inactive mutant, in SST+ interneurons of Npas4-KO mice. Our results
suggest that IQSEC3 is a key GABAergic synapse component that is directed by
Npas4 and ARF activity, specifically in SST+ interneurons, to orchestrate
excitation-to-inhibition balance and control anxiety-like behavior.

In glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and lethal brain tumor, therapies
suppressing recurrently altered signaling pathways failed to extend survival.
However, in patient subsets, specific genetic lesions can confer sensitivity to
targeted agents. By exploiting an integrated model based on patient-derived
stem-like cells, faithfully recapitulating the original GBMs in vitro and
in vivo, here, we identify a human GBM subset (∼9% of all GBMs) characterized by 
ERBB3 overexpression and nuclear accumulation. ERBB3 overexpression is driven by 
inheritable promoter methylation or post-transcriptional silencing of the
oncosuppressor miR-205 and sustains the malignant phenotype. Overexpressed ERBB3 
behaves as a specific signaling platform for fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR), driving PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway hyperactivation, and overall metabolic
upregulation. As a result, ERBB3 inhibition by specific antibodies is lethal for 
GBM stem-like cells and xenotransplants. These findings highlight a subset of
patients eligible for ERBB3-targeted therapy.

Metastasis is a complex and poorly understood process. In pancreatic cancer, loss
of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/BMP effector SMAD4 is correlated with
changes in altered histopathological transitions, metastatic disease, and poor
prognosis. In this study, we use isogenic cancer cell lines to identify SMAD4
regulated genes that contribute to the development of metastatic colonization. We
perform an in vivo screen identifying FOSL1 as both a SMAD4 target and sufficient
to drive colonization to the lung. The targeting of these genes early in
treatment may provide a therapeutic benefit.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are inactivated by dual-specificity
phosphatases (DUSPs), the activities of which are tightly regulated during cell
differentiation. Using knockdown screening and single-cell transcriptional
analysis, we demonstrate that DUSP4 is the phosphatase that specifically
inactivates p38 kinase to promote megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation.
Mechanistically, PRMT1-mediated methylation of DUSP4 triggers its
ubiquitinylation by an E3 ligase HUWE1. Interestingly, the mechanistic axis of
the DUSP4 degradation and p38 activation is also associated with a
transcriptional signature of immune activation in Mk cells. In the context of
thrombocytopenia observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we demonstrate that 
high levels of p38 MAPK and PRMT1 are associated with low platelet counts and
adverse prognosis, while pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or PRMT1
stimulates megakaryopoiesis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the
role of the PRMT1-DUSP4-p38 axis on Mk differentiation and present a strategy for
treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.

During microbial infection, bystander CD8+ T cells that are not specific to
infecting pathogens can be activated by interleukin (IL)-15. However, the
tissue-homing properties of bystander-activated CD8+ T cells have not been
elucidated. Here, we examine the effects of IL-15 on the expression of chemokine 
receptors on CD8+ T cells and their migration. IL-15 upregulates CCR5 in memory
CD8+ T cells in the absence of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enhances
CCR5-dependent migration. IL-15-induced CCR5 upregulation is abrogated by TCR
stimulation, indicating that CCR5 is upregulated in bystander-activated CD8+
T cells. Moreover, CCR5 signals increase proliferation and cytotoxic protein
expression in IL-15-treated memory CD8+ T cells, although the increase has a
small extent. CCR5 upregulation in bystander-activated CD8+ T cells is associated
with severe liver injury in patients with acute hepatitis A. Altogether, the
results indicate that CCR5 upregulation by IL-15 mediates the migration of
bystander-activated CD8+ T cells.

Pancreatic β-cell failure is the key pathogenic element of the complex metabolic 
deterioration in type 2 diabetes (T2D); its underlying pathomechanism is still
elusive. Here, we identify pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein
phosphatases 1 and 2 (PHLPP1/2) as phosphatases whose upregulation leads to
β-cell failure in diabetes. PHLPP levels are highly elevated in metabolically
stressed human and rodent diabetic β-cells. Sustained hyper-activation of
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the primary mechanism of
the PHLPP upregulation linking chronic metabolic stress to ultimate β-cell death.
PHLPPs directly dephosphorylate and regulate activities of β-cell
survival-dependent kinases AKT and MST1, constituting a regulatory triangle loop 
to control β-cell apoptosis. Genetic inhibition of PHLPPs markedly improves
β-cell survival and function in experimental models of diabetes in vitro,
in vivo, and in primary human T2D islets. Our study presents PHLPPs as targets
for functional regenerative therapy of pancreatic β cells in diabetes.

The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates
vesicular trafficking and scaffolds signal transduction. Key upstream components 
of the exocyst include monomeric RAL GTPases, which help mount cell-autonomous
responses to trophic and immunogenic signals. Here, we present a quantitative
proteomics-based characterization of dynamic and signal-dependent exocyst protein
interactomes. Under viral infection, an Exo84 exocyst subcomplex assembles the
immune kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) together with the Hippo kinase Macrophage
Stimulating 1 (MST1). PKR phosphorylates MST1 to activate Hippo signaling and
inactivate Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1). By contrast, a Sec5 exocyst
subcomplex recruits another immune kinase, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which
interacted with and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). RALB was
necessary and sufficient for induction of Hippo and mTOR signaling through
parallel exocyst subcomplex engagement, supporting the cellular response to virus
infection and oncogenic signaling. This study highlights RALB-exocyst signaling
subcomplexes as mechanisms for the integrated engagement of Hippo and mTOR
signaling in cells challenged by viral pathogens or oncogenic signaling.

Phenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for cell and organism
evolution by natural selection. Whereas the role of stochastic gene expression in
phenotypic diversity of genetically identical cells is well studied, not much is 
known regarding the relationship between stochastic gene expression and
individual behavioral variation in animals. We demonstrate that a specific miRNA 
(miR-466f-3p) is upregulated in the hippocampus of a portion of individual inbred
mice upon a Morris water maze task. Significantly, miR-466f-3p positively
regulates the neuron morphology, function and spatial learning, and memory
capability of mice. Mechanistically, miR-466f-3p represses translation of MEF2A, 
a negative regulator of learning/memory. Finally, we show that varied
upregulation of hippocampal miR-466f-3p results from randomized phosphorylation
of hippocampal cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) in individuals. 
This finding of modulation of spatial learning and memory via a randomized
hippocampal signaling axis upon neuronal stimulation represents a demonstration
of how variation in tissue gene expression lead to varied animal behavior.

The evolutionarily conserved Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is a key antioxidant response
pathway that protects cells/organisms against detrimental effects of oxidative
stress. Impaired Nrf2 function is associated with cancer and neurodegenerative
diseases in humans. However, the function of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in the
developing nervous systems has not been established. Here we demonstrate a
cell-autonomous role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, composed of CncC/Nrf2, Keap1, and
MafS, in governing neuronal remodeling during Drosophila metamorphosis.
Nrf2-Keap1 signaling is activated downstream of the steroid hormone ecdysone.
Mechanistically, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is activated via cytoplasmic-to-nuclear
translocation of CncC in an importin- and ecdysone-signaling-dependent manner.
Moreover, Nrf2-Keap1 signaling regulates dendrite pruning independent of its
canonical antioxidant response pathway, acting instead through proteasomal
degradation. This study reveals an epistatic link between the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway 
and steroid hormone signaling and demonstrates an antioxidant-independent but
proteasome-dependent role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in neuronal remodeling.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) controls hepatic lipid
homeostasis and is the target of lipid-lowering fibrate drugs. PPARα activation
represses expression of let-7 microRNA (miRNA), but the function of let-7 in
PPARα signaling and lipid metabolism is unknown. In the current study, a
hepatocyte-specific let-7b/c2 knockout (let7b/c2ΔHep) mouse line is generated,
and these mice are found to exhibit pronounced resistance to diet-induced obesity
and fatty liver. Let-7 inhibition by hepatocyte-specific let-7 sponge expression 
shows similar phenotypes as let7b/c2ΔHep mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis 
reveals that hepatic PPARα signaling is repressed in let7b/c2ΔHep mice. Protein
expression of the obligate PPARα heterodimer partner retinoid X receptor α (RXRα)
is reduced in the livers of let7b/c2ΔHep mice. Ring finger protein 8 (Rnf8),
which is a direct target of let-7, is elevated in let7b/c2ΔHep mouse liver and
identified as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for RXRα. This study highlights a
let-7-RNF8-RXRα regulatory axis that modulates hepatic lipid catabolism.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) activates AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) and plays a crucial role in glucose and lipid metabolism.
Here, we examine whether PPARβ/δ activation effects depend on growth
differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a stress response cytokine that regulates
energy metabolism. Pharmacological PPARβ/δ activation increases GDF15 levels and 
ameliorates glucose intolerance, fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum
stress, and inflammation, and activates AMPK in HFD-fed mice, whereas these
effects are abrogated by the injection of a GDF15 neutralizing antibody and in
Gdf15-/- mice. The AMPK-p53 pathway is involved in the PPARβ/δ-mediated increase 
in GDF15, which in turn activates again AMPK. Consistently, Gdf15-/- mice show
reduced AMPK activation in skeletal muscle, whereas GDF15 administration results 
in AMPK activation in this organ. Collectively, these data reveal a mechanism by 
which PPARβ/δ activation increases GDF15 levels via AMPK and p53, which in turn
mediates the metabolic effects of PPARβ/δ by sustaining AMPK activation.

Humoral immunity relies on the efficient differentiation of memory B cells (MBCs)
into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). T helper (Th) signals upregulate B cell
receptor (BCR) signaling by potentiating Src family kinases through increasing
CD45 phosphatase activity (CD45 PA). In this study, we show that high CD45 PA in 
MBCs enhances BCR signaling and is essential for their effective ASC
differentiation. Mechanistically, Th signals upregulate CD45 PA through
intensifying the surface binding of a CD45 ligand, Galectin-1. CD45 PA works as a
sensor of T cell help and defines high-affinity germinal center (GC) plasma cell 
(PC) precursors characterized by IRF4 expression in vivo. Increasing T cell help 
in vitro results in an incremental CD45 PA increase and enhances ASC
differentiation by facilitating effective induction of the transcription factors 
IRF4 and BLIMP1. This study connects Th signals with BCR signaling through
Galectin-1-dependent regulation of CD45 PA and provides a mechanism for efficient
ASC differentiation of MBCs.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, ROS generated in response to intestinal infection
induces SKN-1, a protective transcription factor homologous to nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 1 or 2 (NRF1/2) in mammals. Many factors regulate
SKN-1, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that
activates SKN-1 by phosphorylation. In this work, another positive regulator of
SKN-1 is identified: NIPI-3, a Tribbles pseudokinase. NIPI-3 has been reported to
protect against intestinal infection by negatively regulating the CCAT enhancer
binding protein (C/EBP) bZIP transcription factor CEBP-1. Here we demonstrate
that CEBP-1 positively regulates the vhp-1 transcript, which encodes a
phosphatase that dephosphorylates the p38 MAPK called PMK-1. The increased levels
of VHP-1 caused by CEBP-1 transcriptional enhancement result in less PMK-1
phosphorylation, affecting SKN-1 activity and intestinal resistance to the
pathogen. The data support a model in which NIPI-3's negative regulation of
CEBP-1 decreases VHP-1 phosphatase activity, allowing increased stimulation of
SKN-1 activity by the p38 MAPK phosphorylation cascade in the intestine.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer, for which
chemotherapy remains standard treatment and additional therapeutic targets are
requisite. Here, we show that AML cells secrete the stem cell growth factor
R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) to promote their self-renewal and prevent cell
differentiation. Although RSPO2 is a well-known WNT agonist, we reveal that it
maintains AML self-renewal WNT independently, by inhibiting BMP receptor
signaling. Autocrine RSPO2 signaling is also required to prevent differentiation 
and to promote self-renewal in normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as primary
AML cells. Comprehensive datamining reveals that RSPO2 expression is elevated in 
patients with AML of poor prognosis. Consistently, inhibiting RSPO2 prolongs
survival in AML mouse xenograft models. Our study indicates that in AML, RSPO2
acts as an autocrine BMP antagonist to promote cancer cell renewal and may serve 
as a marker for poor prognosis.

Aberrant detection of endogenous nucleic acids by the immune system can cause
inflammatory disease. The scaffold function of the signaling kinase RIPK1 limits 
spontaneous activation of the nucleic acid sensor ZBP1. Consequently, loss of
RIPK1 in keratinocytes induces ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and skin inflammation. 
Whether nucleic acid sensing is required to activate ZBP1 in RIPK1-deficient
conditions and which immune pathways are associated with skin disease remained
open questions. Using knock-in mice with disrupted ZBP1 nucleic acid-binding
activity, we report that sensing of endogenous nucleic acids by ZBP1 is critical 
in driving skin pathology characterized by antiviral and IL-17 immune responses. 
Inducing ZBP1 expression by interferons triggers necroptosis in RIPK1-deficient
keratinocytes, and epidermis-specific deletion of MLKL prevents disease,
demonstrating that cell-intrinsic events cause inflammation. These findings
indicate that dysregulated sensing of endogenous nucleic acid by ZBP1 can drive
inflammation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of IL-17-driven inflammatory 
skin conditions such as psoriasis.

Ubiquitination is an essential mechanism in the control of antiviral immunity
upon virus infection. Here, we identify a series of ubiquitination-modulating
enzymes that are modulated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Notably, TRIM24
is down-regulated through direct transcriptional suppression induced by
VSV-activated IRF3. Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I)
induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV
infection. Mechanistically, VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation
to mitochondria, where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked
TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its
association with MAVS and TBK1, which consequently activates downstream antiviral
signaling. Together, these findings establish TRIM24 as a critical positive
regulator in controlling the activation of antiviral signaling and describe a
previously unknown mechanism of TRIM24 function.

A Th2 immune response is central to allergic airway inflammation, which afflicts 
millions worldwide. However, the mechanisms that augment GATA3 expression in an
antigen-primed developing Th2 cell are not well understood. Here, we describe an 
unexpected role for Blimp-1, a transcriptional repressor that constrains
autoimmunity, as an upstream promoter of GATA3 expression that is critical for
Th2 cell development in the lung to inhaled but not systemically delivered
allergens but is dispensable for TFH function and IgE production.
Mechanistically, Blimp-1 acts through Bcl6, leading to increased GATA3 expression
in lung Th2 cells. Surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-21, is required via STAT3 activation to
up-regulate Blimp-1 and promote Th2 cell development. These data reveal a
hitherto unappreciated role for an IL-10-STAT3-Blimp-1 circuit as an initiator of
an inflammatory Th2 response in the lung to allergens. Thus, Blimp-1 in a
context-dependent fashion can drive inflammation by promoting rather than
terminating effector T cell responses.

Approximately one third of cancer patients die due to complexities related to
cachexia. However, the mechanisms of cachexia and the potential therapeutic
interventions remain poorly studied. We observed a significant positive
correlation between SIRT1 expression and muscle fiber cross-sectional area in
pancreatic cancer patients. Rescuing Sirt1 expression by exogenous expression or 
pharmacological agents reverted cancer cell-induced myotube wasting in culture
conditions and mouse models. RNA-seq and follow-up analyses showed cancer
cell-mediated SIRT1 loss induced NF-κB signaling in cachectic muscles that
enhanced the expression of FOXO transcription factors and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4),
a key regulator of reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, we observed 
a negative correlation between NOX4 expression and skeletal muscle fiber
cross-sectional area in pancreatic cancer patients. Knocking out Nox4 in skeletal
muscles or pharmacological blockade of Nox4 activity abrogated tumor-induced
cachexia in mice. Thus, we conclude that targeting the Sirt1-Nox4 axis in muscles
is an effective therapeutic intervention for mitigating pancreatic cancer-induced
cachexia.

Despite a critical role for MYC as an effector of oncogenic RAS, strategies to
target MYC activity in RAS-driven cancers are lacking. In genetically engineered 
mouse models of lung and pancreatic cancer, oncogenic KRAS is insufficient to
drive tumorigenesis, while addition of modest MYC overexpression drives robust
tumor formation, suggesting that mechanisms beyond the RAS pathway play key roles
in MYC regulation and RAS-driven tumorigenesis. Here we show that acidic
fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
cooperates with cancer cell-autonomous signals to increase MYC level, promoter
occupancy, and activity. FGF1 is necessary and sufficient for paracrine
regulation of MYC protein stability, signaling through AKT and GSK-3β to increase
MYC half-life. Patient specimens reveal a strong correlation between stromal CAF 
content and MYC protein level in the neoplastic compartment, and identify CAFs as
the specific source of FGF1 in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our findings
demonstrate that MYC is coordinately regulated by cell-autonomous and
microenvironmental signals, and establish CAF-derived FGF1 as a novel paracrine
regulator of oncogenic transcription.

Upon immunogenic challenge, lymph nodes become mechanically stiff as immune cells
activate and proliferate within their encapsulated environments, and with
resolution, they reestablish a soft baseline state. Here we show that sensing
these mechanical changes in the microenvironment requires the mechanosensor YAP. 
YAP is induced upon activation and suppresses metabolic reprogramming of effector
T cells. Unlike in other cell types in which YAP promotes proliferation, YAP in T
cells suppresses proliferation in a stiffness-dependent manner by directly
restricting the translocation of NFAT1 into the nucleus. YAP slows T cell
responses in systemic viral infections and retards effector T cells in autoimmune
diabetes. Our work reveals a paradigm whereby tissue mechanics fine-tune adaptive
immune responses in health and disease.

CDC-like kinase 3 (CLK3) is a dual specificity kinase that functions on
substrates containing serine/threonine and tyrosine. But its role in human cancer
remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that CLK3 was significantly up-regulated
in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and identified a recurrent Q607R somatic substitution
that represented a gain-of-function mutation in the CLK3 kinase domain. Gene
ontology term enrichment suggested that high CLK3 expression in CCA patients
mainly was associated with nucleotide metabolism reprogramming, which was further
confirmed by comparing metabolic profiling of CCA cells. CLK3 directly
phosphorylated USP13 at Y708, which promoted its binding to c-Myc, thereby
preventing Fbxl14-mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and activating the transcription 
of purine metabolic genes. Notably, the CCA-associated CLK3-Q607R mutant induced 
USP13-Y708 phosphorylation and enhanced the activity of c-Myc. In turn, c-Myc
transcriptionally up-regulated CLK3. Finally, we identified tacrine hydrochloride
as a potential drug to inhibit aberrant CLK3-induced CCA. These findings
demonstrate that CLK3 plays a crucial role in CCA purine metabolism, suggesting a
potential therapeutic utility.

Talin critically controls integrin-dependent cell migration, but its regulatory
role in skin dendritic cells (DCs) during inflammatory responses has not been
investigated. Here, we show that talin1 regulates not only integrin-dependent
Langerhans cell (LC) migration, but also MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor
(TLR)-stimulated DC activation. Talin1-deficient LCs failed to exit the
epidermis, resulting in reduced LC migration to skin-draining lymph nodes (sdLNs)
and defective skin tolerance induction, while talin1-deficient dermal DCs
unexpectedly accumulated in the dermis despite their actomyosin-dependent
migratory capabilities. Furthermore, talin1-deficient DCs exhibited compromised
chemotaxis, NFκB activation, and proinflammatory cytokine production.
Mechanistically, talin1 was required for the formation of preassembled TLR
complexes in DCs at steady state via direct interaction with MyD88 and PIP5K.
Local production of PIP2 by PIP5K then recruited TIRAP to the preassembled
complexes, which were required for TLR signalosome assembly during DC activation.
Thus, talin1 regulates MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathways in DCs through a
novel mechanism with implications for antimicrobial and inflammatory immune
responses.

Tumor cells rely on glutamine to fulfill their metabolic demands and sustain
proliferation. The elevated consumption of glutamine can lead to intratumoral
nutrient depletion, causing metabolic stress that has the potential to impact
tumor progression. Here, we show that nutrient stress caused by glutamine
deprivation leads to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate
that glutamine deficiency regulates EMT through the up-regulation of the EMT
master regulator Slug, a process that is dependent on both MEK/ERK signaling and 
ATF4. We find that Slug is required in PDAC cells for glutamine
deprivation-induced EMT, cell motility, and nutrient stress survival.
Importantly, we decipher that Slug is associated with nutrient stress in PDAC
tumors and is required for metastasis. These results delineate a novel role for
Slug in the nutrient stress response and provide insight into how nutrient
depletion might influence PDAC progression.

Kidney glomerulosclerosis commonly progresses to end-stage kidney failure, but
pathogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that podocyte
expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a complement C3 convertase
regulator, crucially controls disease in murine models of adriamycin
(ADR)-induced focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and streptozotocin
(STZ)-induced diabetic glomerulosclerosis. ADR induces enzymatic cleavage of DAF 
from podocyte surfaces, leading to complement activation. C3 deficiency or
prevention of C3a receptor (C3aR) signaling abrogates disease despite DAF
deficiency, confirming complement dependence. Mechanistic studies show that
C3a/C3aR ligations on podocytes initiate an autocrine IL-1β/IL-1R1 signaling loop
that reduces nephrin expression, causing actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.
Uncoupling IL-1β/IL-1R1 signaling prevents disease, providing a causal link.
Glomeruli of patients with FSGS lack DAF and stain positive for C3d, and urinary 
C3a positively correlates with the degree of proteinuria. Together, our data
indicate that the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis involve loss 
of podocyte DAF, triggering local, complement-dependent, IL-1β-induced podocyte
injury, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets.

Th17 cell differentiation and pathogenicity depend on metabolic reprogramming
inducing shifts toward glycolysis. Here, we show that the pyruvate kinase M2
(PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme required for cancer cell proliferation and tumor
progression, is a key factor mediating Th17 cell differentiation and autoimmune
inflammation. We found that PKM2 is highly expressed throughout the
differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro and during experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) development. Strikingly, PKM2 is not required for the
metabolic reprogramming and proliferative capacity of Th17 cells. However, T
cell-specific PKM2 deletion impairs Th17 cell differentiation and ameliorates
symptoms of EAE by decreasing Th17 cell-mediated inflammation and demyelination. 
Mechanistically, PKM2 translocates into the nucleus and interacts with STAT3,
enhancing its activation and thereby increasing Th17 cell differentiation. Thus, 
PKM2 acts as a critical nonmetabolic regulator that fine-tunes Th17 cell
differentiation and function in autoimmune-mediated inflammation.

The establishment of protective humoral immunity is dependent on the ability of
mature B cells to undergo antibody gene diversification while adjusting to the
physiological stressors induced by activation with the antigen. Mature B cells
diversify their antibody genes by class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic
hypermutation (SHM), which are both dependent on efficient induction of
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Here, we identified PDGFA-associated
protein 1 (Pdap1) as an essential regulator of cellular homeostasis in mature B
cells. Pdap1 deficiency leads to sustained expression of the integrated stress
response (ISR) effector activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and induction of
the ISR transcriptional program, increased cell death, and defective AID
expression. As a consequence, loss of Pdap1 reduces germinal center B cell
formation and impairs CSR and SHM. Thus, Pdap1 protects mature B cells against
chronic ISR activation and ensures efficient antibody diversification by
promoting their survival and optimal function.

PD-L1 up-regulation in cancer contributes to immune evasion by tumor cells. Here,
we show that Wnt ligand and activated EGFR induce the binding of the
β-catenin/TCF/LEF complex to the CD274 gene promoter region to induce PD-L1
expression, in which AKT activation plays an important role. β-Catenin depletion,
AKT inhibition, or PTEN expression reduces PD-L1 expression in tumor cells,
enhances activation and tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and reduces tumor
growth, accompanied by prolonged mouse survival. Combined treatment with a
clinically available AKT inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody overcomes tumor
immune evasion and greatly inhibits tumor growth. In addition, AKT-mediated
β-catenin S552 phosphorylation and nuclear β-catenin are positively correlated
with PD-L1 expression and inversely correlated with the tumor infiltration of
CD8+ T cells in human glioblastoma specimens, highlighting the clinical
significance of β-catenin activation in tumor immune evasion.

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with the pathological
characteristic of white matter injury often leads to lifelong cognitive and
neurobehavioral dysfunction, but relevant therapies to promote remyelination are 
still unavailable. We found that histamine H2 receptor (H2R) negatively regulated
the oligodendrocyte differentiation rate without affecting the oligodendrocytes
at the oligodendrocyte precursor cell stage or mature stage following
oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. Notably, selective deletion of the H2R gene 
(Hrh2) in differentiating oligodendrocytes (Hrh2fl/fl;CNPase-Cre) improved their 
differentiation, remyelination, and functional recovery following neonatal
hypoxia-ischemia in mice. The regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation by
H2R is mediated by binding with Axin2, which leads to up-regulation of the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, H2R antagonists also promoted
oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination and the recovery of cognition
and motor functions following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. Thus, histamine H2R in
oligodendrocytes could serve as a novel and effective therapeutic target for the 
retard of oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination following neonatal
hypoxia-ischemia. The H2R antagonists may have potential therapeutic value for
neonatal HIE.

Posttranslational modification with SUMO is known to regulate the activity of
transcription factors, but how SUMOylation of individual proteins might influence
immunity is largely unexplored. The NFAT transcription factors play an essential 
role in antigen receptor-mediated gene regulation. SUMOylation of NFATc1
represses IL-2 in vitro, but its role in T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo
is unclear. To this end, we generated a novel transgenic mouse in which SUMO
modification of NFATc1 is prevented. Avoidance of NFATc1 SUMOylation ameliorated 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as well as graft-versus-host disease.
Elevated IL-2 production in T cells promoted T reg expansion and suppressed
autoreactive or alloreactive immune responses. Mechanistically, increased IL-2
secretion counteracted IL-17 and IFN-γ expression through STAT5 and Blimp-1
induction. Then, Blimp-1 repressed IL-2 itself, as well as the induced,
proliferation-associated survival factor Bcl2A1. Collectively, these data
demonstrate that prevention of NFATc1 SUMOylation fine-tunes T cell responses
toward lasting tolerance. Thus, targeting NFATc1 SUMOylation presents a novel and
promising strategy to treat T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Podocyte injury is a common hallmark in various glomerular diseases. The level of
LRRC55 was increased in podocytes of patients with focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and membranous nephropathy 
(MN). Upregulated LRRC55 and increased intracellular Ca2+ led to BK channel
activation and the loss of intracellular potassium, resulting in apoptosome
formation and caspase-3 activation in angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated podocytes. 
Knockout of Lrrc55 or the BK channel prevented the BK current and ameliorated
podocyte injury in Ang II-treated mice. Upstream, NFATc3 regulated the expression
of LRRC55. Increased LRRC55 expression in podocytes was also evident in animal
models of FSGS, DN, and MN. Treatment with losartan or LRRC55 siRNA suppressed
LRRC55 expression, prevented BK channel activation, and attenuated podocyte
injury in animal models of FSGS, DN, and MN. In conclusion, upregulated LRRC55
promotes BK channel activation and aggravates cell injury in podocytes in FSGS,
DN, and MN. LRRC55 inhibition may represent a new therapeutic approach for
podocyte injury.

Autophagy programs the metabolic and functional fitness of regulatory T (T reg)
cells to establish immune tolerance, yet the mechanisms governing autophagy
initiation in T reg cells remain unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin
ligase ZFP91 facilitates autophagy activation to sustain T reg cell metabolic
programming and functional integrity. T reg cell-specific deletion of Zfp91
caused T reg cell dysfunction and exacerbated colonic inflammation and
inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis. TCR-triggered autophagy induction
largely relied on T reg cell-derived ZFP91 to restrict hyperglycolysis, which is 
required for the maintenance of T reg cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, ZFP91
rapidly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TCR
stimulation and then mediated BECN1 ubiquitination to promote BECN1-PIK3C3
complex formation. Therefore, our results highlight a ZFP91-dependent mechanism
promoting TCR-initiated autophagosome maturation to maintain T reg cell
homeostasis and function.

During thymocyte development, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) provide
appropriate instructive cues in the thymic microenvironment for not only negative
selection but also the generation of regulatory T (T reg) cells. Here, we
identify that miR-155, a microRNA whose expression in T reg cells has previously 
been shown to be crucial for their development and homeostasis, also contributes 
to thymic T reg (tT reg) cell differentiation by promoting mTEC maturation.
Mechanistically, we show that RANKL stimulation induces expression of miR-155 to 
safeguard the thymic medulla through targeting multiple known and previously
uncharacterized molecules within the TGFβ signaling pathway, which is recognized 
for its role in restricting the maturation and expansion of mTECs. Our work
uncovers a miR-155-TGFβ axis in the thymic medulla to determine mTEC maturity
and, consequently, the quantity of tT reg cells and suggests that miR-155 ensures
proper tT reg cell development in both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic manners.

The role of the PYHIN family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), another
important inflammasome sensor, in EAE remains unclear. In this study, we found
that AIM2 negatively regulates the pathogenesis of EAE independent of
inflammasome activation. AIM2 deficiency enhanced microglia activation and
infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, thereby promoting
neuroinflammation and demyelination during EAE. Mechanistically, AIM2 negatively 
regulates the DNA-PK-AKT3 in microglia to control neuroinflammation
synergistically induced by cGAS and DNA-PK. Administration of a DNA-PK inhibitor 
reduced the severity of the EAE. Collectively, these findings identify a new role
for AIM2 in controlling the onset of EAE. Furthermore, delineation of the
underlying inflammasome-independent mechanism highlights cGAS and DNA-PK
signaling as potential targets for the treatment of heterogeneous MS.

The oncogene DEK is found fused with the NUP214 gene creating oncoprotein
DEK-NUP214 that induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients, and secreted
DEK protein functions as a hematopoietic cytokine to regulate hematopoiesis;
however, the intrinsic role of nuclear DEK in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
remains largely unknown. Here, we show that HSCs lacking DEK display defects in
long-term self-renew capacity, eventually resulting in impaired hematopoiesis.
DEK deficiency reduces quiescence and accelerates mitochondrial metabolism in
HSCs, in part, dependent upon activating mTOR signaling. At the molecular level, 
DEK recruits the corepressor NCoR1 to repress acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 
27 (H3K27ac) and restricts the chromatin accessibility of HSCs, governing the
expression of quiescence-associated genes (e.g., Akt1/2, Ccnb2, and p21).
Inhibition of mTOR activity largely restores the maintenance and potential of
Dek-cKO HSCs. These findings highlight the crucial role of nuclear DEK in
preserving HSC potential, uncovering a new link between chromatin remodelers and 
HSC homeostasis, and have clinical implications.

Although widely used for their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
properties, the prescription of glucocorticoid analogues (e.g., dexamethasone)
has been associated with deleterious glucose metabolism, compromising their
long-term therapeutic use. However, the molecular mechanism remains poorly
understood. In the present study, through transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis 
of two mouse models, we identified a growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible β
(Gadd45β)-dependent pathway that stimulates hepatic glucose production (HGP).
Functional studies showed that overexpression of Gadd45β in vivo or in cultured
hepatocytes activates gluconeogenesis and increases HGP. In contrast,
liver-specific Gadd45β-knockout mice were resistant to high-fat diet- or
steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Of pathophysiological significance, hepatic
Gadd45β expression is up-regulated in several mouse models of obesity and
diabetic patients. Mechanistically, Gadd45β promotes DNA demethylation of PGC-1α 
promoter in conjunction with TET1, thereby stimulating PGC-1α expression to
promote gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia. Collectively, these findings unveil an
epigenomic signature involving Gadd45β/TET1/DNA demethylation in hepatic glucose 
metabolism, enabling the identification of pathogenic factors in diabetes.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a life-threatening disease for which there 
is a lack of effective therapy preventing aortic rupture. During AAA formation,
pathological vascular remodeling is driven by macrophage infiltration, and the
mechanisms regulating macrophage-mediated inflammation remain undefined. Recent
evidence suggests that an epigenetic enzyme, JMJD3, plays a critical role in
establishing macrophage phenotype. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of human AAA 
tissues, we identified increased JMJD3 in aortic monocyte/macrophages resulting
in up-regulation of an inflammatory immune response. Mechanistically, we report
that interferon-β regulates Jmjd3 expression via JAK/STAT and that JMJD3 induces 
NF-κB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription in infiltrating aortic
macrophages. In vivo targeted inhibition of JMJD3 with myeloid-specific genetic
depletion (JMJD3f/fLyz2Cre+) or pharmacological inhibition in the elastase or
angiotensin II-induced AAA model preserved the repressive H3K27me3 on
inflammatory gene promoters and markedly reduced AAA expansion and attenuated
macrophage-mediated inflammation. Together, our findings suggest that
cell-specific pharmacologic therapy targeting JMJD3 may be an effective
intervention for AAA expansion.

TGFβ is essential for the generation of anti-tumor Th9 cells; on the other hand, 
it causes resistance against anti-tumor immunity. Despite recent progress, the
underlying mechanism reconciling the double-edged effect of TGFβ signaling in
Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy remains elusive. Here, we find that
TGFβ-induced down-regulation of bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR)
represents the key mechanism preventing the sustained activation of TGFβ
signaling and thus impairing Th9 inducibility. Mechanistically, BFAR mediates
K63-linked ubiquitination of TGFβR1 at K268, which is critical to activate TGFβ
signaling. Thus, BFAR deficiency or K268R knock-in mutation suppresses TGFβR1
ubiquitination and Th9 differentiation, thereby inhibiting Th9-mediated cancer
immunotherapy. More interestingly, BFAR-overexpressed Th9 cells exhibit promising
therapeutic efficacy to curtail tumor growth and metastasis and promote the
sensitivity of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint immunotherapy. Thus, our findings
establish BFAR as a key TGFβ-regulated gene to fine-tune TGFβ signaling that
causes Th9 induction insensitivity, and they highlight the translational
potential of BFAR in promoting Th9-mediated cancer immunotherapy.

Central precocious puberty (CPP), largely caused by germline mutations in the
MKRN3 gene, has been epidemiologically linked to cancers. MKRN3 is frequently
mutated in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with five cohorts. Genomic MKRN3 
aberrations are significantly enriched in NSCLC samples harboring oncogenic KRAS 
mutations. Low MKRN3 expression levels correlate with poor patient survival.
Reconstitution of MKRN3 in MKRN3-inactivated NSCLC cells directly abrogates in
vitro and in vivo tumor growth and proliferation. MKRN3 knockout mice are
susceptible to urethane-induced lung cancer, and lung cell-specific knockout of
endogenous MKRN3 accelerates NSCLC tumorigenesis in vivo. A mass
spectrometry-based proteomics screen identified PABPC1 as a major substrate for
MKRN3. The tumor suppressor function of MKRN3 is dependent on its E3 ligase
activity, and MKRN3 missense mutations identified in patients substantially
compromise MKRN3-mediated PABPC1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, MKRN3 modulates
cell proliferation through PABPC1 nonproteolytic ubiquitination and subsequently,
PABPC1-mediated global protein synthesis. Our integrated approaches demonstrate
that the CPP-associated gene MKRN3 is a tumor suppressor.

Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway targeting organelles and
macromolecules, thereby regulating various cellular functions. Phosphorylation is
a key posttranscriptional protein modification implicated in the regulation of
biological function including autophagy. Under asynchronous conditions, autophagy
activity is predominantly suppressed by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
kinase, but whether autophagy-related genes (ATG) proteins are phosphorylated
differentially throughout the sequential phases of the cell cycle remains
unclear. In this issue, Li and colleagues report that cyclin-dependent kinase 1
(CDK1) phosphorylates the ULK complex during mitosis. This phosphorylation
induces autophagy and, surprisingly, is shown to drive cell cycle progression.
This work reveals a yet-unappreciated role for autophagy in cell cycle
progression and enhances our understanding of the specific phase-dependent
autophagy regulation during cellular growth and proliferation.

In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by
macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed
proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR)
is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the
polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of 
interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1α/X-box binding
protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have
significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was
induced independent of IFNγ signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1
regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1α- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages
showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells.
Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1α gene signature
and CD274 gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA
sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow-derived macrophages with
IRE1α deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of
regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate CD274 gene
expression. Thus, the IRE1α/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in
the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to
failure of local immune surveillance.

Coordination of gene expression with nutrient availability supports proliferation
and homeostasis and is shaped by protein acetylation. Yet how
physiological/pathological signals link acetylation to specific gene expression
programs and whether such responses are cell-type-specific is unclear.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor, activated by glucose 
limitation to resolve nutrient supply-demand imbalances, critical for diabetes
and cancer. Unexpectedly, we show here that, in gastrointestinal cancer cells,
glucose activates AMPK to selectively induce EP300, but not CREB-binding protein 
(CBP). Consequently, EP300 is redirected away from nuclear receptors that promote
differentiation towards β-catenin, a driver of proliferation and colorectal
tumorigenesis. Importantly, blocking glycogen synthesis permits reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation and AMPK activation in response to glucose in
previously nonresponsive cells. Notably, glycogen content and activity of the
ROS/AMPK/EP300/β-catenin axis are opposite in healthy versus tumor sections.
Glycogen content reduction from healthy to tumor tissue may explain AMPK
switching from tumor suppressor to activator during tumor evolution.

Maternal β-catenin activity is essential and critical for dorsal induction and
its dorsal activation has been thoroughly studied. However, how the maternal
β-catenin activity is suppressed in the nondorsal cells remains poorly
understood. Nanog is known to play a central role for maintenance of the
pluripotency and maternal -zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we reveal a novel role
of Nanog as a strong repressor of maternal β-catenin signaling to safeguard the
embryo against hyperactivation of maternal β-catenin activity and
hyperdorsalization. In zebrafish, knockdown of nanog at different levels led to
either posteriorization or dorsalization, mimicking zygotic or maternal
activation of Wnt/β-catenin activities, and the maternal zygotic mutant of nanog 
(MZnanog) showed strong activation of maternal β-catenin activity and
hyperdorsalization. Although a constitutive activator-type Nanog (Vp16-Nanog,
lacking the N terminal) perfectly rescued the MZT defects of MZnanog, it did not 
rescue the phenotypes resulting from β-catenin signaling activation.
Mechanistically, the N terminal of Nanog directly interacts with T-cell factor
(TCF) and interferes with the binding of β-catenin to TCF, thereby attenuating
the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Therefore, our study establishes a
novel role for Nanog in repressing maternal β-catenin activity and demonstrates a
transcriptional switch between β-catenin/TCF and Nanog/TCF complexes, which
safeguards the embryo from global activation of maternal β-catenin activity.

Tight regulation of gene transcription and mRNA splicing is essential for plant
growth and development. Here we demonstrate that a plant-specific protein, EMBRYO
DEFECTIVE 1579 (EMB1579), controls multiple growth and developmental processes in
Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that EMB1579 forms liquid-like condensates both in
vitro and in vivo, and the formation of normal-sized EMB1579 condensates is
crucial for its cellular functions. We found that some chromosomal and
RNA-related proteins interact with EMB1579 compartments, and loss of function of 
EMB1579 affects global gene transcription and mRNA splicing. Using floral
transition as a physiological process, we demonstrate that EMB1579 is involved in
FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)-mediated repression of flowering. Interestingly, we found
that EMB1579 physically interacts with a homologue of Drosophila nucleosome
remodeling factor 55-kDa (p55) called MULTIPLE SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 4 (MSI4), which 
has been implicated in repressing the expression of FLC by forming a complex with
DNA Damage Binding Protein 1 (DDB1) and Cullin 4 (CUL4). This complex, named
CUL4-DDB1MSI4, physically associates with a CURLY LEAF (CLF)-containing Polycomb 
Repressive Complex 2 (CLF-PRC2). We further demonstrate that EMB1579 interacts
with CUL4 and DDB1, and EMB1579 condensates can recruit and condense MSI4 and
DDB1. Furthermore, emb1579 phenocopies msi4 in terms of the level of H3K27
trimethylation on FLC. This allows us to propose that EMB1579 condensates recruit
and condense CUL4-DDB1MSI4 complex, which facilitates the interaction of
CUL4-DDB1MSI4 with CLF-PRC2 and promotes the role of CLF-PRC2 in establishing
and/or maintaining the level of H3K27 trimethylation on FLC. Thus, we report a
new mechanism for regulating plant gene transcription, mRNA splicing, and growth 
and development.

FCHSD2 controls oncogenic ERK1/2 signaling outcome by regulating endocytic
trafficking.

Xiao GY(1), Schmid SL(1).

Dallas, Texas, United States of America.

The evolution of transformed cancer cells into metastatic tumors is, in part,
driven by altered intracellular signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs). The surface levels and activity of RTKs are governed mainly through
clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), endosomal recycling, or degradation. In
turn, oncogenic signaling downstream of RTKs can reciprocally regulate endocytic 
trafficking by creating feedback loops in cells to enhance tumor progression. We 
previously showed that FCH/F-BAR and Double SH3 Domain-Containing Protein
(FCHSD2) has a cancer-cell specific function in regulating CME in non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that FCHSD2 loss impacts recycling of 
the RTKs, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proto-oncogene c-Met (MET),
and shunts their trafficking into late endosomes and lysosomal degradation.
Notably, FCHSD2 depletion results in the nuclear translocation of active
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), leading to enhanced
transcription and up-regulation of EGFR and MET. The small GTPase, Ras-related
protein Rab-7A (Rab7), is essential for the FCHSD2 depletion-induced effects.
Correspondingly, FCHSD2 loss correlates to higher tumor grades of NSCLC.
Clinically, NSCLC patients expressing high FCHSD2 exhibit elevated survival,
whereas patients with high Rab7 expression display decreased survival rates. Our 
study provides new insight into the molecular nexus for crosstalk between
oncogenic signaling and RTK trafficking that controls cancer progression.

Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to cellular
senescence, which contributes to advanced age-related disorders, it is unclear
how Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), an essential transcriptional factor of
cardiovascular remodeling, mediates the link between mitochondrial dynamics and
vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Here, we show that Klf5
down-regulation in VSMCs is correlated with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA), an age-related vascular disease. Mice lacking Klf5 in VSMCs exacerbate
vascular senescence and progression of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA by
facilitating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Klf5 knockdown enhances,
while Klf5 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, Klf5
activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) transcription
through binding to the promoter of eIF5a, which in turn preserves mitochondrial
integrity by interacting with mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). Accordingly, decreased
expression of eIF5a elicited by Klf5 down-regulation leads to mitochondrial
fission and excessive ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission
decreases ROS production and VSMC senescence. Our studies provide a potential
therapeutic target for age-related vascular disorders.

The small GTPase RhoA is a central signaling enzyme that is involved in various
cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, and cell cycle
progression. Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA-for instance,
Gαq-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via Gαq-dependent activation of
RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been
identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different
upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this
study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of
RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second
phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca2+/PKC, respectively, and
further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the 
mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational
modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA
activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required
for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor
signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and
persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal
regulation.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Aβ
phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase
Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5×FAD)
mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Aβ was then impaired, and therefore Peli1
depletion suppressed the Aβ deposition in the brains of 5×FAD mice. Mechanistic
characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein (C/EBP)β, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription 
of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of
C/EBPβ and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of
Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPβ and the expression of CD36 and thus,
promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings
established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and
highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of
microglia-mediated neurological diseases.

Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of
cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic
reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we
screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity
to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the 
metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells,
mouse models, and patients' tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide
de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in
vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key 
metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced
nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer 
cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis,
guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and
downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and
metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate
synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells
and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients,
the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly
correlated with patient's survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo
synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its
metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and
metastasis of breast cancer.

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against 
ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated
through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of
angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase
(SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc
and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)
expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is
inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 
and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRSS101D/S241D,
a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support
normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRSS101A/S241A, a
phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents
hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the VEGFA promoter, and activation 
of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRSS101A/S241A strongly inhibits normal and 
tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating
hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in
post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development.
The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide
therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in
pathological settings.

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in
neurodegenerative diseases such as C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a
neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (LSM12) and exchange protein
directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (EPAC1) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic
RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the C9ORF72-derived
poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells
aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while
promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, LSM12
posttranscriptionally up-regulated EPAC1 expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression
rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in LSM12-deleted cells. C9-ALS
patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells
(C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of LSM12 and EPAC1. Lentiviral
overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the 
pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for
apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin
β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the
nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the
LSM12-EPAC1 pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in 
C9-ALS/FTD.

The Hippo-YAP pathway responds to diverse environmental cues to manage tissue
homeostasis, organ regeneration, tumorigenesis, and immunity. However, how
phosphatase(s) directly target Yes-associated protein (YAP) and determine its
physiological activity are still inconclusive. Here, we utilized an unbiased
phosphatome screening and identified protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A
(PPM1A/PP2Cα) as the bona fide and physiological YAP phosphatase. We found that
PPM1A was associated with YAP/TAZ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to
directly eliminate phospho-S127 on YAP, which conferring YAP the nuclear
distribution and transcription potency. Accordingly, genetic ablation or
depletion of PPM1A in cells, organoids, and mice elicited an enhanced YAP/TAZ
cytoplasmic retention and resulted in the diminished cell proliferation, severe
gut regeneration defects in colitis, and impeded liver regeneration upon injury. 
These regeneration defects in murine model were largely rescued via a genetic
large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) deficiency or the pharmacological
inhibition of Hippo-YAP signaling. Therefore, we identify a physiological
phosphatase of YAP/TAZ, describe its critical effects in YAP/TAZ cellular
distribution, and demonstrate its physiological roles in mammalian organ
regeneration.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a critical role in promoting
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, invasion, and tumor
metastasis. ΔNp63α, the major isoform of p63 protein expressed in epithelial
cells, is a key transcriptional regulator of cell adhesion program and functions 
as a critical metastasis suppressor. It has been documented that the expression
of ΔNp63α is tightly controlled by oncogenic signaling and is frequently reduced 
in advanced cancers. However, whether TGF-β signaling regulates ΔNp63α expression
in promoting metastasis is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that
activation of TGF-β signaling leads to stabilization of E3 ubiquitin ligase
FBXO3, which, in turn, targets ΔNp63α for proteasomal degradation in a
Smad-independent but Erk-dependent manner. Knockdown of FBXO3 or restoration of
ΔNp63α expression effectively rescues TGF-β-induced EMT, cell motility, and tumor
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clinical analyses reveal a
significant correlation among TGF-β receptor I (TβRI), FBXO3, and p63 protein
expression and that high expression of TβRI/FBXO3 and low expression of p63 are
associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Together, these results
demonstrate that FBXO3 facilitates ΔNp63α degradation to empower TGF-β signaling 
in promoting tumor metastasis and that the TβRI-FBXO3-ΔNp63α axis is critically
important in breast cancer development and clinical prognosis. This study
suggests that FBXO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for advanced breast
cancer treatment.

The function of Sprouty2 (Spry2) in T cells is unknown. Using 2 different
(inducible and T cell-targeted) knockout mouse strains, we found that Spry2
positively regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling
by modulating the activity of LCK. Spry2-/- CD4+ T cells were unable to activate 
LCK, proliferate, differentiate into T helper cells, or produce cytokines. Spry2 
deficiency abrogated type 2 inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in a murine
model of asthma. Spry2 expression was higher in blood and airway CD4+ T cells
from patients with asthma, and Spry2 knockdown impaired human T cell
proliferation and cytokine production. Spry2 deficiency up-regulated the lipid
raft protein caveolin-1, enhanced its interaction with CSK, and increased CSK
interaction with LCK, culminating in augmented inhibitory phosphorylation of LCK.
Knockdown of CSK or dislodgment of caveolin-1-bound CSK restored ERK1/2
activation in Spry2-/- T cells, suggesting an essential role for Spry2 in LCK
activation and T cell function.

The regulation of protein synthesis is essential for maintaining cellular
homeostasis, especially during stress responses, and its dysregulation could
underlie the development of human diseases. The critical step during translation 
regulation is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha
(eIF2α). Here we report the identification of a direct kinase of eIF2α,
microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), which phosphorylates eIF2α in
response to proteotoxic stress. The activity of MARK2 was confirmed in the cells 
lacking the 4 previously known eIF2α kinases. MARK2 itself was found to be a
substrate of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), which serves as a sensor for protein 
misfolding stress through a dynamic interaction with heat shock protein 90
(HSP90). Both MARK2 and PKCδ are activated via phosphorylation in
proteotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative mouse models and in human patients
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These results reveal a PKCδ-MARK2-eIF2α
cascade that may play a critical role in cellular proteotoxic stress responses
and human diseases.

Mutations in mitochondrial replicative polymerase PolγA lead to progressive
external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). While PolγA is the known central player in
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, it is unknown whether a regulatory process
exists on the mitochondrial outer membrane which controlled its entry into the
mitochondria. We now demonstrate that PolγA is ubiquitylated by mitochondrial E3 
ligase, MITOL (or MARCH5, RNF153). Ubiquitylation in wild-type (WT) PolγA occurs 
at Lysine 1060 residue via K6 linkage. Ubiquitylation of PolγA negatively
regulates its binding to Tom20 and thereby its mitochondrial entry. While
screening different PEO patients for mitochondrial entry, we found that a subset 
of the PolγA mutants is hyperubiquitylated by MITOL and interact less with Tom20.
These PolγA variants cannot enter into mitochondria, instead becomes enriched in 
the insoluble fraction and undergo enhanced degradation. Hence, mtDNA
replication, as observed via BrdU incorporation into the mtDNA, was compromised
in these PEO mutants. However, by manipulating their ubiquitylation status by 2
independent techniques, these PEO mutants were reactivated, which allowed the
incorporation of BrdU into mtDNA. Thus, regulated entry of non-ubiquitylated
PolγA may have beneficial consequences for certain PEO patients.

Resistance to androgen receptor (AR) targeting therapeutics in prostate cancer
(PC) is a significant clinical problem. Mechanisms by which this is accomplished 
include AR amplification and expression of AR splice variants, demonstrating that
AR remains a key therapeutic target in advanced disease. For the first time we
show that IKBKE drives AR signalling in advanced PC. Significant inhibition of AR
regulated gene expression was observed upon siRNA-mediated IKBKE depletion or
pharmacological inhibition due to inhibited AR gene expression in multiple cell
line models including a LNCaP derivative cell line resistant to the
anti-androgen, enzalutamide (LNCaP-EnzR). Phenotypically, this resulted in
significant inhibition of proliferation, migration and colony forming ability
suggesting that targeting IKBKE could circumvent resistance to AR targeting
therapies. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition in the CWR22Rv1 xenograft mouse
model reduced tumour size and enhanced survival. Critically, this was validated
in patient-derived explants where enzymatic inactivation of IKBKE reduced cell
proliferation and AR expression. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that IKBKE 
regulates AR levels via Hippo pathway inhibition to reduce c-MYC levels at
cis-regulatory elements within the AR gene. Thus, IKBKE is a therapeutic target
in advanced PC suggesting repurposing of clinically tested IKBKE inhibitors could
be beneficial to castrate resistant PC patients.

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) frequently regulate the expression of other RBPs in
mammalian cells. Such cross-regulation has been proposed to be important to
control networks of coordinated gene expression; however, much remains to be
understood about how such networks of cross-regulation are established and what
the functional consequence is of coordinated or reciprocal expression of RBPs.
Here we demonstrate that the RBPs CELF2 and hnRNP C regulate the expression of
each other, such that depletion of one results in reduced expression of the
other. Specifically, we show that loss of hnRNP C reduces the transcription of
CELF2 mRNA, while loss of CELF2 results in decreased efficiency of hnRNP C
translation. We further demonstrate that this reciprocal regulation serves to
fine tune the splicing patterns of many downstream target genes. Together, this
work reveals new activities of hnRNP C and CELF2, provides insight into a
previously unrecognized gene regulatory network, and demonstrates how
cross-regulation of RBPs functions to shape the cellular transcriptome.

Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are coupled to promote gene expression and
regulation. However, mechanisms by which transcription and splicing influence
each other are still under investigation. The ATPase Prp5p is required for
pre-spliceosome assembly and splicing proofreading at the branch-point region.
From an open UV mutagenesis screen for genetic suppressors of prp5 defects and
subsequent targeted testing, we identify components of the TBP-binding module of 
the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, Spt8p and Spt3p. Spt8Δ and
spt3Δ rescue the cold-sensitivity of prp5-GAR allele, and prp5 mutants restore
growth of spt8Δ and spt3Δ strains on 6-azauracil. By chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we find that prp5 alleles decrease recruitment of RNA
polymerase II (Pol II) to an intron-containing gene, which is rescued by spt8Δ.
Further ChIP-seq reveals that global effects on Pol II-binding are mutually
rescued by prp5-GAR and spt8Δ. Inhibited splicing caused by prp5-GAR is also
restored by spt8Δ. In vitro assays indicate that Prp5p directly interacts with
Spt8p, but not Spt3p. We demonstrate that Prp5p's splicing proofreading is
modulated by Spt8p and Spt3p. Therefore, this study reveals that interactions
between the TBP-binding module of SAGA and the spliceosomal ATPase Prp5p mediate 
a balance between transcription initiation/elongation and pre-spliceosome
assembly.

Originally identified as an RNA polymerase II interactor, Che-1/AATF (Che-1) has 
now been recognized as a multifunctional protein involved in cell-cycle
regulation and cancer progression, as well as apoptosis inhibition and response
to stress. This protein displays a peculiar nucleolar localization and it has
recently been implicated in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Here, we
report the identification of a novel function of Che-1 in the regulation of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, in both cancer and normal cells. We demonstrate
that Che-1 interacts with RNA polymerase I and nucleolar upstream binding factor 
(UBF) and promotes RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. Furthermore, this
protein binds to the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and modulates its epigenetic state
by contrasting the recruitment of HDAC1. Che-1 downregulation affects RNA
polymerase I and UBF recruitment on rDNA and leads to reducing rDNA promoter
activity and 47S pre-rRNA production. Interestingly, Che-1 depletion induces
abnormal nucleolar morphology associated with re-distribution of nucleolar
proteins. Finally, we show that upon DNA damage Che-1 re-localizes from rDNA to
TP53 gene promoter to induce cell-cycle arrest. This previously uncharacterized
function of Che-1 confirms the important role of this protein in the regulation
of ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation and response to stress.

We have previously found that UV-induced DNA damage causes hyperphosphorylation
of the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), inhibition of
transcriptional elongation and changes in alternative splicing (AS) due to
kinetic coupling between transcription and splicing. In an unbiased search for
protein kinases involved in the AS response to DNA damage, we have identified
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) as an unforeseen participant. Unlike Cdk9
inhibition, GSK-3 inhibition only prevents CTD hyperphosphorylation triggered by 
UV but not basal phosphorylation. This effect is not due to differential
degradation of the phospho-CTD isoforms and can be reproduced, at the AS level,
by overexpression of a kinase-dead GSK-3 dominant negative mutant. GSK-3
inhibition abrogates both the reduction in RNAPII elongation and changes in AS
elicited by UV. We show that GSK-3 phosphorylates the CTD in vitro, but
preferentially when the substrate is previously phosphorylated, consistently with
the requirement of a priming phosphorylation reported for GSK-3 efficacy. In line
with a role for GSK-3 in the response to DNA damage, GSK-3 inhibition prevents
UV-induced apoptosis. In summary, we uncover a novel role for a widely studied
kinase in key steps of eukaryotic transcription and pre-mRNA processing.

The DNA damage checkpoint halts cell cycle progression in G2 in response to
genotoxic insults. Central to the execution of cell cycle arrest is the
checkpoint-induced stabilization of securin-separase complex (yeast Pds1-Esp1).
The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (yeast Chk1 and Rad53) are thought to
critically contribute to the stability of securin-separase complex by
phosphorylation of securin, rendering it resistant to proteolytic destruction by 
the anaphase promoting complex (APC). Dun1, a Rad53 paralog related to Chk2, is
also essential for checkpoint-imposed arrest. Dun1 is required for the DNA
damage-induced transcription of DNA repair genes; however, its role in the
execution of cell cycle arrest remains unknown. Here, we show that Dun1's role in
checkpoint arrest is independent of its involvement in the transcription of
repair genes. Instead, Dun1 is necessary to prevent Pds1 destruction during DNA
damage in that the Dun1-deficient cells degrade Pds1, escape G2 arrest and
undergo mitosis despite the presence of checkpoint-active Chk1 and Rad53.
Interestingly, proteolytic degradation of Pds1 in the absence of Dun1 is mediated
not by APC but by the HECT domain-containing E3 ligase Rsp5. Our results suggest 
a regulatory scheme in which Dun1 prevents chromosome segregation during DNA
damage by inhibiting Rsp5-mediated proteolytic degradation of securin Pds1.

RPS28B mRNA acts as a scaffold promoting cis-translational interaction of
proteins driving P-body assembly.

P-bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic mRNA-protein (mRNP) granules conserved throughout 
eukaryotes which are implicated in the repression, storage and degradation of
mRNAs. PB assembly is driven by proteins with self-interacting and low-complexity
domains. Non-translating mRNA also stimulates PB assembly, however no studies to 
date have explored whether particular mRNA transcripts are more critical than
others in facilitating PB assembly. Previous work revealed that rps28bΔ (small
ribosomal subunit-28B) mutants do not form PBs under normal growth conditions.
Here, we demonstrate that the RPS28B 3'UTR is important for PB assembly,
consistent with it harboring a binding site for the PB assembly protein Edc3.
However, expression of the RPS28B 3'UTR alone is insufficient to drive PB
assembly. Intriguingly, chimeric mRNA studies revealed that Rps28 protein,
translated in cis from an mRNA bearing the RPS28B 3'UTR, physically interacts
more strongly with Edc3 than Rps28 protein synthesized in trans. This Edc3-Rps28 
interaction in turn facilitates PB assembly. Our work indicates that PB assembly 
may be nucleated by specific RNA 'scaffolds'. Furthermore, this is the first
description in yeast to our knowledge of a cis-translated protein interacting
with another protein in the 3'UTR of the mRNA which encoded it, which in turn
stimulates assembly of cellular structures.

API5 (APoptosis Inhibitor 5) and nuclear FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) are
upregulated in various human cancers and are correlated with poor prognosis.
Although their physical interaction has been identified, the function related to 
the resulting complex is unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of
the API5-FGF2 complex and identified critical residues driving the protein
interaction. These findings provided a structural basis for the nuclear
localization of the FGF2 isoform lacking a canonical nuclear localization signal 
and identified a cryptic nuclear localization sequence in FGF2. The interaction
between API5 and FGF2 was important for mRNA nuclear export through both the TREX
and eIF4E/LRPPRC mRNA export complexes, thus regulating the export of bulk mRNA
and specific mRNAs containing eIF4E sensitivity elements, such as c-MYC and
cyclin D1. These data show the newly identified molecular function of API5 and
nuclear FGF2, and provide a clue to understanding the dynamic regulation of mRNA 
export.

Most eukaryotic mRNAs harbor a characteristic 5' m7GpppN cap that promotes
pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation while also
protecting mRNAs from exonucleolytic attacks. mRNA caps are eliminated by Dcp2
during mRNA decay, allowing 5'-3' exonucleases to degrade mRNA bodies. However,
the Dcp2 decapping enzyme is poorly active on its own and requires binding to
stable or transient protein partners to sever the cap of target mRNAs. Here, we
analyse the role of one of these partners, the yeast Pby1 factor, which is known 
to co-localize into P-bodies together with decapping factors. We report that Pby1
uses its C-terminal domain to directly bind to the decapping enzyme. We solved
the structure of this Pby1 domain alone and bound to the Dcp1-Dcp2-Edc3 decapping
complex. Structure-based mutant analyses reveal that Pby1 binding to the
decapping enzyme is required for its recruitment into P-bodies. Moreover, Pby1
binding to the decapping enzyme stimulates growth in conditions in which
decapping activation is compromised. Our results point towards a direct
connection of Pby1 with decapping and P-body formation, both stemming from its
interaction with the Dcp1-Dcp2 holoenzyme.

OGG1 initiated base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for repair of
oxidative DNA base damage 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Here, we report that RECQL4 DNA 
helicase, deficient in the cancer-prone and premature aging Rothmund-Thomson
syndrome, physically and functionally interacts with OGG1. RECQL4 promotes
catalytic activity of OGG1 and RECQL4 deficiency results in defective 8-oxoG
repair and increased genomic 8-oxoG. Furthermore, we show that acute oxidative
stress leads to increased RECQL4 acetylation and its interaction with OGG1. The
NAD+-dependent protein SIRT1 deacetylates RECQL4 in vitro and in cells thereby
controlling the interaction between OGG1 and RECQL4 after DNA repair and
maintaining RECQL4 in a low acetylated state. Collectively, we find that RECQL4
is involved in 8-oxoG repair through interaction with OGG1, and that SIRT1
indirectly modulates BER of 8-oxoG by controlling RECQL4-OGG1 interaction.

Functional crosstalk between histone modifications and chromatin remodeling has
emerged as a key regulatory mode of transcriptional control during cell fate
decisions, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we
discover an HRP2-DPF3a-BAF epigenetic pathway that coordinates methylated histone
H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling to regulate
chromatin dynamics and gene transcription during myogenic differentiation. Using 
siRNA screening targeting epigenetic modifiers, we identify hepatoma-derived
growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP2) as a key regulator of myogenesis. Knockout
of HRP2 in mice leads to impaired muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, through
its HIV integrase binding domain (IBD), HRP2 associates with the
BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex by interacting
directly with the BAF45c (DPF3a) subunit. Through its Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP)
domain, HRP2 preferentially binds to H3K36me2. Consistent with the biochemical
studies, ChIP-seq analyses show that HRP2 colocalizes with DPF3a across the
genome and that the recruitment of HRP2/DPF3a to chromatin is dependent on
H3K36me2. Integrative transcriptomic and cistromic analyses, coupled with
ATAC-seq, reveal that HRP2 and DPF3a activate myogenic genes by increasing
chromatin accessibility through recruitment of BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the
BAF complex. Taken together, these results illuminate a key role for the
HRP2-DPF3a-BAF complex in the epigenetic coordination of gene transcription
during myogenic differentiation.

The nucleolus is a membrane-less nuclear structure that disassembles when cells
undergo mitosis. During mitosis, nucleolar factors are thus released from the
nucleolus and dynamically change their subcellular localization; however, their
functions remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we found that a nucleolar factor 
called nucleolar protein 11 (NOL11) forms a protein complex with two
tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat proteins named WD-repeat protein 43 (WDR43) 
and Cirhin in mitotic cells. This complex, referred to here as the NWC
(NOL11-WDR43-Cirhin) complex, exists in nucleoli during interphase and
translocates to the periphery of mitotic chromosomes, i.e., perichromosomal
regions. During mitotic progression, both the congression of chromosomes to the
metaphase plate and sister chromatid cohesion are impaired in the absence of the 
NWC complex, as it is required for the centromeric enrichment of Aurora B and the
associating phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3. These results reveal
the characteristics of a novel protein complex consisting of nucleolar proteins, 
which is required for regulating kinetochores and centromeres to ensure faithful 
chromosome segregation.

Mitoribosome biogenesis is an expensive metabolic process that is essential to
maintain cellular respiratory capacity and requires the stoichiometric
accumulation of rRNAs and proteins encoded in two distinct genomes. In yeast, the
ribosomal protein Var1, alias uS3m, is mitochondrion-encoded. uS3m is a protein
universally present in all ribosomes, where it forms part of the small subunit
(SSU) mRNA entry channel and plays a pivotal role in ribosome loading onto the
mRNA. However, despite its critical functional role, very little is known
concerning VAR1 gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the protein Sov1 is an
in bona fide VAR1 mRNA translational activator and additionally interacts with
newly synthesized Var1 polypeptide. Moreover, we show that Sov1 assists the late 
steps of mtSSU biogenesis involving the incorporation of Var1, an event necessary
for uS14 and mS46 assembly. Notably, we have uncovered a translational regulatory
mechanism by which Sov1 fine-tunes Var1 synthesis with its assembly into the
mitoribosome.

Cell growth requires a high level of protein synthesis and oncogenic pathways
stimulate cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis. Less is known about how
cells respond to dysfunctional mRNA translation and how this feeds back into
growth regulatory pathways. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EBNA1 causes
mRNA translation stress in cis that activates PI3Kδ. This leads to the
stabilization of MDM2, induces MDM2's binding to the E2F1 mRNA and promotes E2F1 
translation. The MDM2 serine 166 regulates the interaction with the E2F1 mRNA and
deletion of MDM2 C-terminal RING domain results in a constitutive E2F1 mRNA
binding. Phosphorylation on serine 395 following DNA damage instead regulates p53
mRNA binding to its RING domain and prevents the E2F1 mRNA interaction. The
p14Arf tumour suppressor binds MDM2 and in addition to preventing degradation of 
the p53 protein it also prevents the E2F1 mRNA interaction. The data illustrate
how two MDM2 domains selectively bind specific mRNAs in response to cellular
conditions to promote, or suppress, cell growth and how p14Arf coordinates MDM2's
activity towards p53 and E2F1. The data also show how EBV via EBNA1-induced mRNA 
translation stress targets the E2F1 and the MDM2 - p53 pathway.

and HEN2 by RNA-seq supports the idea that SE cooperates with NEXT for RNA
surveillance by the nuclear exosome. Among the RNA targets accumulating in
absence of SE or NEXT are miRNA precursors. Loss of NEXT components results in
the accumulation of pri-miRNAs without affecting levels of miRNAs, indicating
that NEXT is, unlike SE, not required for miRNA processing. As compared to se-2, 
se-2 hen2-2 double mutants showed increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs, but
partially restored levels of mature miRNAs and attenuated developmental defects. 
We propose that the slow degradation of pri-miRNAs caused by loss of HEN2
compensates for the poor miRNA processing efficiency in se-2 mutants, and that SE
regulates miRNA biogenesis through its double contribution in promoting miRNA
processing but also pri-miRNA degradation through the recruitment of the NEXT
complex.

The modulation of GLI2, an oncogenic transcription factor commonly upregulated in
cancer, is in many cases not due to genetic defects, suggesting dysregulation
through alternative mechanisms. The identity of these molecular events remains
for the most part unknown. Here, we identified TFII-I as a novel repressor of
GLI2 expression. Mapping experiments suggest that the INR region of the GLI2
promoter is necessary for GLI2 repression. ChIP studies showed that TFII-I binds 
to this INR. TFII-I knockdown decreased the binding of NELF-A, a component of the
promoter-proximal pausing complex at this site, and enriched phosphorylated
RNAPII serine 2 in the GLI2 gene body. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate
TFII-I interaction with SPT5, another pausing complex component. TFII-I
overexpression antagonized GLI2 induction by TGFβ, a known activator of GLI2 in
cancer cells. TGFβ reduced endogenous TFII-I binding to the INR and increased
RNAPII SerP2 in the gene body. We demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism is
not exclusive of GLI2. TGFβ-induced genes CCR7, TGFβ1 and EGR3 showed similar
decreased TFII-I and NELF-A INR binding and increased RNAPII SerP2 in the gene
body post-TGFβ treatment. Together these results identify TFII-I as a novel
repressor of a subset of TGFβ-responsive genes through the regulation of RNAPII
pausing.

R-loops are formed when replicative forks collide with the transcriptional
machinery and can cause genomic instability. However, it is unclear how R-loops
are regulated at transcription-replication conflict (TRC) sites and how replisome
proteins are regulated to prevent R-loop formation or mediate R-loop tolerance.
Here, we report that ATAD5, a PCNA unloader, plays dual functions to reduce
R-loops both under normal and replication stress conditions. ATAD5 interacts with
RNA helicases such as DDX1, DDX5, DDX21 and DHX9 and increases the abundance of
these helicases at replication forks to facilitate R-loop resolution. Depletion
of ATAD5 or ATAD5-interacting RNA helicases consistently increases R-loops during
the S phase and reduces the replication rate, both of which are enhanced by
replication stress. In addition to R-loop resolution, ATAD5 prevents the
generation of new R-loops behind the replication forks by unloading PCNA which,
otherwise, accumulates and persists on DNA, causing a collision with the
transcription machinery. Depletion of ATAD5 reduces transcription rates due to
PCNA accumulation. Consistent with the role of ATAD5 and RNA helicases in
maintaining genomic integrity by regulating R-loops, the corresponding genes were
mutated or downregulated in several human tumors.

Biogenesis of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) involves several 
conserved small GTPases. Here, we report that the Obg family protein GTPBP5 or
MTG2 is a mitochondrial protein whose absence in a TALEN-induced HEK293T knockout
(KO) cell line leads to severely decreased levels of the 55S monosome and
attenuated mitochondrial protein synthesis. We show that a fraction of GTPBP5
co-sediments with the large mitoribosome subunit (mtLSU), and crosslinks
specifically with the 16S rRNA, and several mtLSU proteins and assembly factors. 
Notably, the latter group includes MTERF4, involved in monosome assembly, and
MRM2, the methyltransferase that catalyzes the modification of the 16S mt-rRNA
A-loop U1369 residue. The GTPBP5 interaction with MRM2 was also detected using
the proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) assay. In GTPBP5-KO mitochondria,
the mtLSU lacks bL36m, accumulates an excess of the assembly factors MTG1,
GTPBP10, MALSU1 and MTERF4, and contains hypomethylated 16S rRNA. We propose that
GTPBP5 primarily fuels proper mtLSU maturation by securing efficient methylation 
of two 16S rRNA residues, and ultimately serves to coordinate subunit joining
through the release of late-stage mtLSU assembly factors. In this way, GTPBP5
provides an ultimate quality control checkpoint function during mtLSU assembly
that minimizes premature subunit joining to ensure the assembly of the mature 55S
monosome.

Circadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that control ∼24-hour physiology and 
behaviors in virtually all organisms. The circadian oscillator comprises
interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops, but also
requires finely coordinated protein homeostasis including protein degradation and
maturation. However, the mechanisms underlying the mammalian clock protein
maturation is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that necdin, one of 
the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)-causative genes, is highly expressed in the
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the pacemaker of circadian clocks in mammals. Mice 
deficient in necdin show abnormal behaviors during an 8-hour advance jet-lag
paradigm and disrupted clock gene expression in the liver. By using yeast two
hybrid screening, we identified BMAL1, the core component of the circadian clock,
and co-chaperone SGT1 as two necdin-interactive proteins. BMAL1 and SGT1
associated with the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of necdin, respectively. 
Mechanistically, necdin enables SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery to stabilize
BMAL1. Depletion of necdin or SGT1/HSP90 leads to degradation of BMAL1 through
the ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in alterations in both clock gene
expression and circadian rhythms. Taken together, our data identify the
PWS-associated protein necdin as a novel regulator of the circadian clock, and
further emphasize the critical roles of chaperone machinery in circadian clock
regulation.

Coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and ribosomal protein
gene (RPG) transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RNAP) is a key
requirement for growth control. Although evidence for balance between
RNPI-dependent 35S rRNA production and RNAPII-mediated RPG transcription have
been described, the molecular basis is still obscure. Here, we found that Rph1
modulates the transcription status of both rRNAs and RPGs in yeast. We show that 
Rph1 widely associates with RNAPI and RNAPII-transcribed genes. Deletion of RPH1 
remarkably alleviates cell slow growth caused by TORC1 inhibition via
derepression of rRNA and RPG transcription under nutrient stress conditions.
Mechanistically, Rim15 kinase phosphorylates Rph1 upon rapamycin treatment.
Phosphorylation-mimetic mutant of Rph1 exhibited more resistance to rapamycin
treatment, decreased association with ribosome-related genes, and faster cell
growth compared to the wild-type, indicating that Rph1 dissociation from
chromatin ensures cell survival upon nutrient stress. Our results uncover the
role of Rph1 in coordination of RNA polymerases-mediated transcription to control
cell growth under nutrient stress conditions.

The IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is a non-catalytic post-transcriptional
enhancer of tumor growth upregulated and associated with adverse prognosis in
solid cancers. However, conserved effector pathway(s) and the feasibility of
targeting IGF2BP1 in cancer remained elusive. We reveal that IGF2BP1 is a
post-transcriptional enhancer of the E2F-driven hallmark in solid cancers.
IGF2BP1 promotes G1/S cell cycle transition by stabilizing mRNAs encoding
positive regulators of this checkpoint like E2F1. This IGF2BP1-driven shortening 
of the G1 cell cycle phase relies on 3'UTR-, miRNA- and m6A-dependent regulation 
and suggests enhancement of cell cycle progression by m6A-modifications across
cancers. In addition to E2F transcription factors, IGF2BP1 also stabilizes
E2F-driven transcripts directly indicating post-transcriptional 'super'-enhancer 
role of the protein in E2F-driven gene expression in cancer. The small molecule
BTYNB disrupts this enhancer function by impairing IGF2BP1-RNA association.
Consistently, BTYNB interferes with E2F-driven gene expression and tumor growth
in experimental mouse tumor models.

The differentiation and regeneration of skeletal muscle from myoblasts to
myotubes involves myogenic transcription factors, such as myocardin-related
transcription factor A (MRTF-A) and serum response factor (SRF). In addition,
post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is required during myogenesis. Here, we
provide evidence for novel mechanisms regulating MRTF-A during myogenic
differentiation. Endogenous MRTF-A protein abundance and activity decreased
during C2C12 differentiation, which was attributable to miRNA-directed
inhibition. Conversely, overexpression of MRTF-A impaired differentiation and
myosin expression. Applying miRNA trapping by RNA affinity purification (miTRAP),
we identified miRNAs which directly regulate MRTF-A via its 3'UTR, including
miR-1a-3p, miR-206-3p, miR-24-3p and miR-486-5p. These miRNAs were upregulated
during differentiation and specifically recruited to the 3'UTR of MRTF-A.
Concomitantly, Ago2 recruitment to the MRTF-A 3'UTR was considerably increased,
whereas Dicer1 depletion or 3'UTR deletion elevated MRTF-A and inhibited
differentiation. MRTF-A protein expression was inhibited by ectopic miRNA
expression in murine C2C12 and primary human myoblasts. 3'UTR reporter activity
diminished upon differentiation or miRNA expression, whereas deletion of the
predicted binding sites reversed these effects. Furthermore, TGF-β abolished
MRTF-A reduction and decreased miR-486-5p expression. Our findings implicate
miR-24-3p and miR-486-5p in the repression of MRTF-A and suggest a complex
network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating
myogenesis.

Epigenetic regulation is important for establishing lineage-specific gene
expression during early development. Although signaling pathways have been
well-studied for regulation of trophectoderm reprogramming, epigenetic regulation
of trophectodermal genes with histone modification dynamics have been poorly
understood. Here, we identify that plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) is a
key epigenetic regulator for activation of trophectodermal genes using
RNA-sequencing and ChIP assays. PHF6 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for
ubiquitination of H2BK120 (H2BK120ub) via its extended plant homeodomain 1
(PHD1), while the extended PHD2 of PHF6 recognizes acetylation of H2BK12
(H2BK12Ac). Intriguingly, the recognition of H2BK12Ac by PHF6 is important for
exerting its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for H2BK120ub. Together, our data
provide evidence that PHF6 is crucial for epigenetic regulation of
trophectodermal gene expression by linking H2BK12Ac to H2BK120ub modification.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a well-characterized
transcription factor that protects cells against oxidative and electrophilic
stresses. Emerging evidence has suggested that NRF2 protects cells against DNA
damage by mechanisms other than antioxidation, yet the mechanism remains poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate that knockout of NRF2 in cells results in
hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) in the presence or absence of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under ROS scavenging conditions, induction of DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs) increases the NRF2 protein level and recruits NRF2 to
DNA damage sites where it interacts with ATR, resulting in activation of the
ATR-CHK1-CDC2 signaling pathway. In turn, this leads to G2 cell cycle arrest and 
the promotion of homologous recombination repair of DSBs, thereby preserving
genome stability. The inhibition of NRF2 by brusatol increased the
radiosensitivity of tumor cells in xenografts by perturbing ATR and CHK1
activation. Collectively, our results reveal a novel function of NRF2 as an ATR
activator in the regulation of the cellular response to DSBs. This shift in
perspective should help furnish a more complete understanding of the function of 
NRF2 and the DNA damage response.

Microcephalin 1 (MCPH1) was identified from genetic mutations in patients with
primary autosomal recessive microcephaly. In response to DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs), MCPH1 forms damage-induced foci and recruits BRCA2-RAD51 complex, a key
component of the DSB repair machinery for homologous recombination (HR), to
damage sites. Accordingly, the efficiency of HR is significantly attenuated upon 
depletion of MCPH1. The biochemical characteristics of MCPH1 and its functional
interaction with the HR machinery had remained unclear due to lack of highly
purified MCPH1 recombinant protein for functional study. Here, we established a
mammalian expression system to express and purify MCPH1 protein. We show that
MCPH1 is a bona fide DNA-binding protein and provide direct biochemical analysis 
of this MCPH family protein. Furthermore, we reveal that MCPH1 directly interacts
with RAD51 at multiple contact points, providing evidence for how MCPH1
physically engages with the HR machinery. Importantly, we demonstrate that MCPH1 
enhances the stability of RAD51 on single-strand DNA, a prerequisite step for
RAD51-mediated recombination. Single-molecule tethered particle motion analysis
showed a ∼2-fold increase in the lifetime of RAD51-ssDNA filaments in the
presence of MCPH1. Thus, our study demonstrates direct crosstalk between
microcephaly protein MCPH1 and the recombination component RAD51 for DSB repair.

The NAD+-dependent deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase SIRT6 stabilizes 
the genome by promoting DNA double strand break repair, thereby acting as a tumor
suppressor. However, whether SIRT6 regulates nucleotide excision repair (NER)
remains unknown. Here, we showed that SIRT6 was recruited to sites of UV-induced 
DNA damage and stimulated the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Mechanistic
studies further indicated that SIRT6 interacted with DDB2, the major sensor
initiating global genome NER (GG-NER), and that the interaction was enhanced upon
UV irradiation. SIRT6 deacetylated DDB2 at two lysine residues, K35 and K77, upon
UV stress and then promoted DDB2 ubiquitination and segregation from chromatin,
thereby facilitating downstream signaling. In addition, we characterized several 
SIRT6 mutations derived from melanoma patients. These SIRT6 mutants ablated the
stimulatory effect of SIRT6 on NER and destabilized the genome due to (i) partial
loss of enzymatic activity (P27S or H50Y), (ii) a nonsense mutation (R150*) or
(iii) high turnover rates (G134W). Overall, we demonstrate that SIRT6 promotes
NER by deacetylating DDB2, thereby preventing the onset of melanomagenesis.

N 6-methylation of 2'-O-methyladenosine (Am) in RNA occurs in eukaryotic cells to
generate N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Identification of the
methyltransferase responsible for m6Am catalysis has accelerated studies on the
function of m6Am in RNA processing. While m6Am is generally found in the first
transcribed nucleotide of mRNAs, the modification is also found internally within
U2 snRNA. However, the writer required for catalyzing internal m6Am formation had
remained elusive. By sequencing transcriptome-wide RNA methylation at
single-base-resolution, we identified human METTL4 as the writer that directly
methylates Am at U2 snRNA position 30 into m6Am. We found that METTL4 localizes
to the nucleus and its conserved methyltransferase catalytic site is required for
U2 snRNA methylation. By sequencing human cells with overexpressed Mettl4, we
determined METTL4's in vivo target RNA motif specificity. In the absence of
Mettl4 in human cells, U2 snRNA lacks m6Am thereby affecting a subset of splicing
events that exhibit specific features such as 3' splice-site weakness and an
increase in exon inclusion. These findings suggest that METTL4 methylation of U2 
snRNA regulates splicing of specific pre-mRNA transcripts.

The nuclear Cap-Binding Complex (CBC), consisting of Nuclear Cap-Binding Protein 
1 (NCBP1) and 2 (NCBP2), associates with the nascent 5'cap of RNA polymerase II
transcripts and impacts RNA fate decisions. Recently, the C17orf85 protein, also 
called NCBP3, was suggested to form an alternative CBC by replacing NCBP2.
However, applying protein-protein interaction screening of NCBP1, 2 and 3, we
find that the interaction profile of NCBP3 is distinct. Whereas NCBP1 and 2
identify known CBC interactors, NCBP3 primarily interacts with components of the 
Exon Junction Complex (EJC) and the TRanscription and EXport (TREX) complex.
NCBP3-EJC association in vitro and in vivo requires EJC core integrity and the in
vivo RNA binding profiles of EJC and NCBP3 overlap. We further show that NCBP3
competes with the RNA degradation factor ZC3H18 for binding CBC-bound
transcripts, and that NCBP3 positively impacts the nuclear export of
polyadenylated RNAs and the expression of large multi-exonic transcripts.
Collectively, our results place NCBP3 with the EJC and TREX complexes in
supporting mRNA expression.

NBS1 is a critical component of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex, which
regulates ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Mutations in 
NBS1 cause the human genomic instability syndrome Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome
(NBS), of which neuronal deficits, including microcephaly and intellectual
disability, are classical hallmarks. Given its function in the DDR to ensure
proper proliferation and prevent death of replicating cells, NBS1 is essential
for life. Here we show that, unexpectedly, Nbs1 deletion is dispensable for
postmitotic neurons, but compromises their arborization and migration due to
dysregulated Notch signaling. We find that Nbs1 interacts with NICD-RBPJ, the
effector of Notch signaling, and inhibits Notch activity. Genetic ablation or
pharmaceutical inhibition of Notch signaling rescues the maturation and migration
defects of Nbs1-deficient neurons in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of Notch by 
Nbs1 deletion is independent of the key DDR downstream effector p53 and
inactivation of each MRN component produces a different pattern of Notch activity
and distinct neuronal defects. These data indicate that neuronal defects and
aberrant Notch activity in Nbs1-deficient cells are unlikely to be a direct
consequence of loss of MRN-mediated DDR function. This study discloses a novel
function of NBS1 in crosstalk with the Notch pathway in neuron development.

ATR functions as a master regulator of the DNA-damage response. ATR activation
requires the ATR activator, topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1).
However, the underlying mechanism of TopBP1 regulation and how its regulation
affects DNA replication remain unknown. Here, we report a specific interaction
between TopBP1 and the histone demethylase PHF8. The TopBP1/PHF8 interaction is
mediated by the BRCT 7+8 domain of TopBP1 and phosphorylation of PHF8 at Ser854. 
This interaction is cell-cycle regulated and phosphorylation-dependent. PHF8 is
phosphorylated by CK2, which regulates binding of PHF8 to TopBP1. Importantly,
PHF8 regulates TopBP1 protein level by preventing its ubiquitination and
degradation mediated by the E3 ligase UBR5. Interestingly, PHF8pS854 is likely to
contribute to regulation of TopBP1 stability and DNA replication checkpoint.
Further, both TopBP1 and PHF8 are required for efficient replication fork
restart. Together, these data identify PHF8 as a TopBP1-binding protein and
provide mechanistic insight into how PHF8 regulates TopBP1 stability to maintain 
DNA replication.

IRF3 and IRF7 are critical transcription factors in the innate immune response.
Their activation is controlled by phosphorylation events, leading to the
formation of homodimers that are transcriptionally active. Phosphorylation occurs
when IRF3 is recruited to adaptor proteins via a positively charged surface
within the regulatory domain of IRF3. This positively charged surface also plays 
a crucial role in forming the active homodimer by interacting with the
phosphorylated sites stabilizing the homodimer. Here, we describe a distinct
molecular interaction that is responsible for adaptor docking and hence
phosphorylation as well as a separate interaction responsible for the formation
of active homodimer. We then demonstrate that IRF7 can be activated by both MAVS 
and STING in a manner highly similar to that of IRF3 but with one key difference.
Regulation of IRF7 appears more tightly controlled; while a single
phosphorylation event is sufficient to activate IRF3, at least two
phosphorylation events are required for IRF7 activation.

Msh homeobox (Msx) is a subclass of homeobox transcriptional regulators that
control cell lineage development, including the early stage of vertebrate limb
development, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we
demonstrate that Msx1 promotes the proliferation of myoblasts and mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) by enhancing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.
Msx1 directly binds to and upregulates the expression of fibroblast growth factor
9 (Fgf9) and Fgf18. Accordingly, knockdown or antibody neutralization of Fgf9/18 
inhibits Msx1-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2)
phosphorylation. Mechanistically, we determined that the phosphorylation of Msx1 
at Ser136 is critical for enhancing Fgf9 and Fgf18 expression and cell
proliferation, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is apparently responsible for
Ser136 phosphorylation. Furthermore, mesenchymal deletion of Msx1/2 results in
decreased Fgf9 and Fgf18 expression and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which leads to
serious defects in limb development in mice. Collectively, our findings
established an important function of the Msx1-Fgf-MAPK signaling axis in
promoting cell proliferation, thus providing a new mechanistic insight into limb 
development.

LSH, a SNF2 family DNA helicase, is a key regulator of DNA methylation in
mammals. How LSH facilitates DNA methylation is not well defined. While previous 
studies with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESc) and fibroblasts (MEFs) derived
from Lsh knockout mice have revealed a role of Lsh in de novo DNA methylation by 
Dnmt3a/3b, here we report that LSH contributes to DNA methylation in various cell
lines primarily by promoting DNA methylation by DNMT1. We show that loss of LSH
has a much bigger effect in DNA methylation than loss of DNMT3A and DNMT3B.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LSH interacts with UHRF1 but not DNMT1 and
facilitates UHRF1 chromatin association and UHRF1-catalyzed histone H3
ubiquitination in an ATPase activity-dependent manner, which in turn promotes
DNMT1 recruitment to replication fork and DNA methylation. Notably, UHRF1 also
enhances LSH association with the replication fork. Thus, our study identifies
LSH as an essential factor for DNA methylation by DNMT1 and provides novel
insight into how a feed-forward loop between LSH and UHRF1 facilitates
DNMT1-mediated maintenance of DNA methylation in chromatin.

The biogenesis of eukaryotic RNA polymerases is poorly understood. The present
study used a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to explore the
assembly of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in yeast. We identified a regulatory
link between Rbs1, a Pol III assembly factor, and Rpb10, a small subunit that is 
common to three RNA polymerases. Overexpression of Rbs1 increased the abundance
of both RPB10 mRNA and the Rpb10 protein, which correlated with suppression of
Pol III assembly defects. Rbs1 is a poly(A)mRNA-binding protein and mutational
analysis identified R3H domain to be required for mRNA interactions and genetic
enhancement of Pol III biogenesis. Rbs1 also binds to Upf1 protein, a key
component in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and levels of RPB10 mRNA were
increased in a upf1Δ strain. Genome-wide RNA binding by Rbs1 was characterized by
UV cross-linking based approach. We demonstrated that Rbs1 directly binds to the 
3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of many mRNAs including transcripts encoding Pol
III subunits, Rpb10 and Rpc19. We propose that Rbs1 functions by opposing mRNA
degradation, at least in part mediated by NMD pathway. Orthologues of Rbs1
protein are present in other eukaryotes, including humans, suggesting that this
is a conserved regulatory mechanism.

PrimPol has been recently identified as a DNA damage tolerant polymerase that
plays an important role in replication stress response. However, the regulatory
mechanisms of PrimPol are not well defined. In this study, we identify that the
deubiquitinase USP36 interferes with degradation of PrimPol to regulate the
replication stress response. Mechanistically, USP36 is deubiquitinated following 
DNA replication stress, which in turn facilitates its upregulation and
interaction with PrimPol. USP36 deubiquitinates K29-linked polyubiquitination of 
PrimPol and increases its protein stability. Depletion of USP36 results in
replication stress-related defects and elevates cell sensitivity to DNA-damage
agents, such as cisplatin and olaparib. Moreover, USP36 expression positively
correlates with the level of PrimPol protein and poor prognosis in patient
samples. These findings indicate that the regulation of PrimPol K29-linked
ubiquitination by USP36 plays a critical role in DNA replication stress and
chemotherapy response.

PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with previously characterized
homologs in Drosophila (zfrp8) and budding yeast (Tsr4). Although mammalian PDCD2
is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development, the function of
PDCD2 that underlies its fundamental cellular role has remained unclear. Here, we
used quantitative proteomics approaches to define the protein-protein interaction
network of human PDCD2. Our data revealed that PDCD2 specifically interacts with 
the 40S ribosomal protein uS5 (RPS2) and that the PDCD2-uS5 complex is assembled 
co-translationally. Loss of PDCD2 expression leads to defects in the synthesis of
the small ribosomal subunit that phenocopy a uS5 deficiency. Notably, we show
that PDCD2 is important for the accumulation of soluble uS5 protein as well as
its incorporation into 40S ribosomal subunit. Our findings support that the
essential molecular function of PDCD2 is to act as a dedicated ribosomal protein 
chaperone that recognizes uS5 co-translationally in the cytoplasm and accompanies
uS5 to ribosome assembly sites in the nucleus. As most dedicated ribosomal
protein chaperones have been identified in yeast, our study reveals that similar 
mechanisms exist in human cells to assist ribosomal proteins coordinate their
folding, nuclear import and assembly in pre-ribosomal particles.

Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs potently regulate gene expression programs in physiology
and disease. Here, we describe a key function for lncRNA OIP5-AS1 in myogenesis, 
the process whereby myoblasts differentiate into myotubes during muscle
development and muscle regeneration after injury. In human myoblasts, OIP5-AS1
levels increased robustly early in myogenesis, and its loss attenuated myogenic
differentiation and potently reduced the levels of the myogenic transcription
factor MEF2C. This effect relied upon the partial complementarity of OIP5-AS1
with MEF2C mRNA and the presence of HuR, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with
affinity for both transcripts. Remarkably, HuR binding to MEF2C mRNA, which
stabilized MEF2C mRNA and increased MEF2C abundance, was lost after OIP5-AS1
silencing, suggesting that OIP5-AS1 might serve as a scaffold to enhance HuR
binding to MEF2C mRNA, in turn increasing MEF2C production. These results
highlight a mechanism whereby a lncRNA promotes myogenesis by enhancing the
interaction of an RBP and a myogenic mRNA.

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes histone H3 Lys27
trimethylation (H3K27me3) to repress gene transcription in multicellular
eukaryotes. Despite its importance in gene silencing and cellular
differentiation, how PRC2 is recruited to target loci is still not fully
understood. Here, we report genome-wide evidence for the recruitment of PRC2 by
the transcriptional repressors VIVIPAROUS1/ABI3-LIKE1 (VAL1) and VAL2 in
Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the val1 val2 double mutant possesses somatic 
embryonic phenotypes and a transcriptome strikingly similar to those of the swn
clf double mutant, which lacks the PRC2 catalytic subunits SWINGER (SWN) and
CURLY LEAF (CLF). We further show that VAL1 and VAL2 physically interact with SWN
and CLF in vivo. Genome-wide binding profiling demonstrated that they colocalize 
with SWN and CLF at PRC2 target loci. Loss of VAL1/2 significantly reduces SWN
and CLF enrichment at PRC2 target loci and leads to a genome-wide redistribution 
of H3K27me3 that strongly affects transcription. Finally, we provide evidence
that the VAL1/VAL2-RY regulatory system is largely independent of previously
identified modules for Polycomb silencing in plants. Together, our work
demonstrates an extensive genome-wide interaction between VAL1/2 and PRC2 and
provides mechanistic insights into the establishment of Polycomb silencing in
plants.

Secondary wall thickening in the sclerenchyma cells is strictly controlled by a
complex network of transcription factors in vascular plants. However, little is
known about the epigenetic mechanism regulating secondary wall biosynthesis. In
this study, we identified that ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG of TRITHORAX1 (ATX1), a
H3K4-histone methyltransferase, mediates the regulation of fiber cell wall
development in inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis thaliana. Genome-wide analysis 
revealed that the up-regulation of genes involved in secondary wall formation
during stem development is largely coordinated by increasing level of H3K4
tri-methylation. Among all histone methyltransferases for H3K4me3 in Arabidopsis,
ATX1 is markedly increased during the inflorescence stem development and
loss-of-function mutant atx1 was impaired in secondary wall thickening in
interfascicular fibers. Genetic analysis showed that ATX1 positively regulates
secondary wall deposition through activating the expression of secondary wall NAC
master switch genes, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1) and NAC
SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1). We further identified that
ATX1 directly binds the loci of SND1 and NST1, and activates their expression by 
increasing H3K4me3 levels at these loci. Taken together, our results reveal that 
ATX1 plays a key role in the regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in
interfascicular fibers during inflorescence stem development of Arabidopsis.

Repair of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) by the metalloprotease SPRTN
prevents genome instability, premature aging and carcinogenesis. SPRTN is
specifically activated by DNA structures containing single- and double-stranded
features, but degrades the protein components of DPCs promiscuously and
independent of amino acid sequence. This lack of specificity is useful to target 
diverse protein adducts, however, it requires tight control in return, in order
to prohibit uncontrolled proteolysis of chromatin proteins. Here, we discover the
components and principles of a ubiquitin switch, which negatively regulates
SPRTN. We demonstrate that monoubiquitylation is induced in an E3
ligase-independent manner and, in contrast to previous assumptions, does not
control chromatin access of the enzyme. Data obtained in cells and in vitro
reveal that monoubiquitylation induces inactivation of the enzyme by triggering
autocatalytic cleavage in trans while also priming SPRTN for proteasomal
degradation in cis. Finally, we show that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP7
antagonizes this negative control of SPRTN in the presence of DPCs.

Double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks are a significant threat to
genomic stability that can lead to chromosomal rearrangements or cell death. The 
protein CtIP promotes DNA end resection, an early step in homologous
recombination repair, and has been found to protect perturbed forks from
excessive nucleolytic degradation. However, it remains unknown how CtIP's
function in fork protection is regulated. Here, we show that CtIP recruitment to 
sites of DNA damage and replication stress is impaired upon global inhibition of 
SUMOylation. We demonstrate that CtIP is a target for modification by SUMO-2 and 
that this occurs constitutively during S phase. The modification is dependent on 
the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases and the PI-3-kinase-related kinase ATR
on CtIP's carboxyl-terminal region, an interaction with the replication factor
PCNA, and the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS4. We also identify residue K578 as a key
residue that contributes to CtIP SUMOylation. Functionally, a CtIP mutant where
K578 is substituted with a non-SUMOylatable arginine residue is defective in
promoting DNA end resection, homologous recombination, and in protecting stalled 
replication forks from excessive nucleolytic degradation. Our results shed
further light on the tightly coordinated regulation of CtIP by SUMOylation in the
maintenance of genome stability.

DNA damage response is a fundamental mechanism to maintain genome stability. The 
ATR-WEE1 kinase module plays a central role in response to replication stress.
Although the ATR-WEE1 pathway has been well studied in yeasts and animals, how
ATR-WEE1 functions in plants remains unclear. Through a genetic screen for
suppressors of the Arabidopsis atr mutant, we found that loss of function of
PRL1, a core subunit of the evolutionarily conserved MAC complex involved in
alternative splicing, suppresses the hypersensitivity of atr and wee1 to
replication stress. Biochemical studies revealed that WEE1 directly interacts
with and phosphorylates PRL1 at Serine 145, which promotes PRL1 ubiquitination
and subsequent degradation. In line with the genetic and biochemical data,
replication stress induces intron retention of cell cycle genes including CYCD1;1
and CYCD3;1, which is abolished in wee1 but restored in wee1 prl1. Remarkably,
co-expressing the coding sequences of CYCD1;1 and CYCD3;1 partially restores the 
root length and HU response in wee1 prl1. These data suggested that the ATR-WEE1 
module inhibits the MAC complex to regulate replication stress responses. Our
study discovered PRL1 or the MAC complex as a key downstream regulator of the
ATR-WEE1 module and revealed a novel cell cycle control mechanism.

Alkylating drugs are among the most often used chemotherapeutics. While cancer
cells frequently develop resistance to alkylation treatments, detailed
understanding of mechanisms that lead to the resistance is limited. Here, by
using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 based screen, we identify transcriptional Mediator 
complex subunit 13 (MED13) as a novel modulator of alkylation response. The
alkylation exposure causes significant MED13 downregulation, while complete loss 
of MED13 results in reduced apoptosis and resistance to alkylating agents.
Transcriptome analysis identified cyclin D1 (CCND1) as one of the highly
overexpressed genes in MED13 knock-out (KO) cells, characterized by shorter G1
phase. MED13 is able to bind to CCND1 regulatory elements thus influencing the
expression. The resistance of MED13 KO cells is directly dependent on the cyclin 
D1 overexpression, and its down-regulation is sufficient to re-sensitize the
cells to alkylating agents. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of
MED13-mediated response, by applying combinatory treatment with CDK8/19 inhibitor
Senexin A. Importantly, the treatment with Senexin A stabilizes MED13, and in
combination with alkylating agents significantly reduces viability of cancer
cells. In summary, our findings identify novel alkylation stress response
mechanism dependent on MED13 and cyclin D1 that can serve as basis for
development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a wide range of roles in the epigenetic
regulation of crucial biological processes, but the functions of lncRNAs in
cortical development are poorly understood. Using human embryonic stem cell
(hESC)-based 2D neural differentiation approach and 3D cerebral organoid system, 
we identified that the lncRNA PAUPAR, which is adjacent to PAX6, plays essential 
roles in cortical differentiation by interacting with PAX6 to regulate the
expression of a large number of neural genes. Mechanistic studies showed that
PAUPAR confers PAX6 proper binding sites on the target neural genes by directly
binding the genomic regions of these genes. Moreover, PAX6 recruits the histone
methyltransferase NSD1 through its C-terminal PST enrichment domain, then
regulate H3K36 methylation and the expression of target genes. Collectively, our 
data reveal that the PAUPAR/PAX6/NSD1 complex plays a critical role in the
epigenetic regulation of hESC cortical differentiation and highlight the
importance of PAUPAR as an intrinsic regulator of cortical differentiation.

Maintenance of stem-cell identity requires proper regulation of enhancer
activity. Both transcription factors OCT4/SOX2/NANOG and histone
methyltransferase complexes MLL/SET1 were shown to regulate enhancer activity,
but how they are regulated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains further
studies. Here, we report a transcription factor BACH1, which directly interacts
with OCT4/SOX2/NANOG (OSN) and MLL/SET1 methyltransferase complexes and maintains
pluripotency in mouse ESCs (mESCs). BTB domain and bZIP domain of BACH1 are
required for these interactions and pluripotency maintenance. Loss of BACH1
reduced the interaction between NANOG and MLL1/SET1 complexes, and decreased
their occupancy on chromatin, and further decreased H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
(H3K4me3) level on gene promoters and (super-) enhancers, leading to decreased
enhancer activity and transcription activity, especially on stemness-related
genes. Moreover, BACH1 recruited NANOG through chromatin looping and regulated
remote NANOG binding, fine-tuning enhancer-promoter activity and gene expression.
Collectively, these observations suggest that BACH1 maintains pluripotency in
ESCs by recruiting NANOG and MLL/SET1 complexes to chromatin and maintaining the 
trimethylated state of H3K4 and enhancer-promoter activity, especially on
stemness-related genes.

The major clinical problem in human cancer is metastasis. Metastases are the
cause of 90% of human cancer deaths. TAp63 is a critical suppressor of
tumorigenesis and metastasis. ΔNp63 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor to
block the function of p53 and TAp63. Although several ubiquitin E3 ligases have
been reported to regulate p63 stability, the mechanism of p63 regulation remains 
partially understood. Herein, we show that CHIP, an E3 ligase with a U-box
domain, physically interacts with p63 and promotes p63 degradation. Notably,
Hsp70 depletion by siRNA stabilizes TAp63 in H1299 cells and destabilizes ΔNp63
in SCC9 cells. Loss of Hsp70 results in a reduction in the TAp63-CHIP interaction
in H1299 cells and an increase in the interaction between ΔNp63 and CHIP in SCC9 
cells. Our results reveal that Hsp70 acts as a molecular switch to control
CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p63 isoforms. Furthermore,
regulation of p63 by the Hsp70-CHIP axis contributes to the migration and
invasion of tumor cells. Hence, our findings demonstrate that Hsp70 is a crucial 
regulator of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p63 isoforms and
identify a new pathway for maintaining TAp63 or ΔNp63 stability in cancers.

The DNA damage-responsive tumor suppressors p53 and HIPK2 are well established
regulators of cell fate decision-making and regulate the cellular sensitivity to 
DNA-damaging drugs. Here, we identify Deleted in Azoospermia-associated protein 2
(DAZAP2), a small adaptor protein, as a novel regulator of HIPK2 and specifier of
the DNA damage-induced p53 response. Knock-down or genetic deletion of DAZAP2
strongly potentiates cancer cell chemosensitivity both in cells and in vivo using
a mouse tumour xenograft model. In unstressed cells, DAZAP2 stimulates HIPK2
polyubiquitination and degradation through interplay with the ubiquitin ligase
SIAH1. Upon DNA damage, HIPK2 site-specifically phosphorylates DAZAP2, which
terminates its HIPK2-degrading function and triggers its re-localization to the
cell nucleus. Interestingly, nuclear DAZAP2 interacts with p53 and specifies
target gene expression through modulating a defined subset of p53 target genes.
Furthermore, our results suggest that DAZAP2 co-occupies p53 response elements to
specify target gene expression. Collectively, our findings propose DAZAP2 as
novel regulator of the DNA damage-induced p53 response that controls cancer cell 
chemosensitivity.

The ubiquitous RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) promotes telomerase activity by
associating with the telomerase noncoding RNA TERC. However, the role of the
neural-specific members HuB, HuC, and HuD (ELAVL2-4) in telomerase activity is
unknown. Here, we report that HuB and HuD, but not HuC, repress telomerase
activity in human neuroblastoma cells. By associating with AU-rich sequences in
TERC, HuB and HuD repressed the assembly of the TERT-TERC core complex.
Furthermore, HuB and HuD competed with HuR for binding to TERC and antagonized
the function of HuR that was previously shown to enhance telomerase activity to
promote cell growth. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism controlling telomerase
activity in human neuroblastoma cells that involves a competition between HuR and
the related, neural-specific proteins HuB and HuD.

DNA repair pathways are essential to maintain the integrity of the genome and
prevent cell death and tumourigenesis. Here, we show that the
Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (Banf1) protein has a role in the repair of DNA
double-strand breaks. Banf1 is characterized as a nuclear envelope protein and
mutations in Banf1 are associated with the severe premature aging syndrome,
Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome. We have previously shown that Banf1 directly 
regulates the activity of PARP1 in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Here, we 
show that Banf1 also has a role in modulating DNA double-strand break repair
through regulation of the DNA-dependent Protein Kinase catalytic subunit,
DNA-PKcs. Specifically, we demonstrate that Banf1 relocalizes from the nuclear
envelope to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. We also show that Banf1 can bind
to and directly inhibit the activity of DNA-PKcs. Supporting this, cellular
depletion of Banf1 leads to an increase in non-homologous end-joining and a
decrease in homologous recombination, which our data suggest is likely due to
unrestrained DNA-PKcs activity. Overall, this study identifies how Banf1
regulates double-strand break repair pathway choice by modulating DNA-PKcs
activity to control genome stability within the cell.

RPA is a critical factor for DNA replication and replication stress response.
Surprisingly, we found that chromatin RPA stability is tightly regulated. We
report that the GDP/GTP exchange factor DOCK7 acts as a critical replication
stress regulator to promote RPA stability on chromatin. DOCK7 is phosphorylated
by ATR and then recruited by MDC1 to the chromatin and replication fork during
replication stress. DOCK7-mediated Rac1/Cdc42 activation leads to the activation 
of PAK1, which subsequently phosphorylates RPA1 at S135 and T180 to stabilize
chromatin-loaded RPA1 and ensure proper replication stress response. Moreover,
DOCK7 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and depleting DOCK7 sensitizes cancer
cells to camptothecin. Taken together, our results highlight a novel role for
DOCK7 in regulation of the replication stress response and highlight potential
therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance in cancer.

LARP1 is a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation. It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety 
and the adjacent 5'TOP motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the
eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation via
LARP1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the
mechanism by which mTORC1 controls LARP1's translation repression activity. We
demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates LARP1 in vitro and in vivo, activities
that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26
rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on LARP1 that are
distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of
residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding DM15 region is particularly
sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the RNA-binding and the translation
inhibitory activities of LARP1. Our results unravel a new model of translation
control in which the La module (LaMod) and DM15 region of LARP1, both of which
can directly interact with TOP mRNA, are differentially regulated: the LaMod
remains constitutively bound to PABP (irrespective of the activation status of
mTORC1), while the C-terminal DM15 'pendular hook' engages the TOP mRNA 5'-end to
repress translation, but only in conditions of mTORC1 inhibition.

Post-transcriptional control is essential to safeguard structural and metabolic
changes in enucleated reticulocytes during their terminal maturation to
functional erythrocytes. The timely synthesis of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase
(ALOX15), which initiates mitochondria degradation at the final stage of
reticulocyte maturation is regulated by the multifunctional protein HNRNPK. It
constitutes a silencing complex at the ALOX15 mRNA 3' untranslated region that
inhibits translation initiation at the AUG by impeding the joining of ribosomal
60S subunits to 40S subunits. To elucidate how HNRNPK interferes with 80S
ribosome assembly, three independent screens were applied. They consistently
demonstrated a differential interaction of HNRNPK with RPS19, which is localized 
at the head of the 40S subunit and extends into its functional center. During
induced erythroid maturation of K562 cells, decreasing arginine dimethylation of 
HNRNPK is linked to a reduced interaction with RPS19 in vitro and in vivo.
Dimethylation of residues R256, R258 and R268 in HNRNPK affects its interaction
with RPS19. In noninduced K562 cells, RPS19 depletion results in the induction of
ALOX15 synthesis and mitochondria degradation. Interestingly, residue W52 in
RPS19, which is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), participates
in specific HNRNPK binding and is an integral part of a putative aromatic cage.

Molecular bases of eukaryotic circadian clocks mainly rely on
transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs), while epigenetic codes also
play critical roles in fine-tuning circadian rhythms. However, unlike histone
modification codes that play extensive and well-known roles in the regulation of 
circadian clocks, whether DNA methylation (5mC) can affect the circadian clock,
and the associated underlying molecular mechanisms, remains largely unexplored in
many organisms. Here we demonstrate that global genome DNA hypomethylation can
significantly lengthen the circadian period of Arabidopsis. Transcriptomic and
genetic evidence demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), encoding an
F-box containing protein, is required for the DNA hypomethylation-tuned circadian
clock. Moreover, SDC can physically interact with another F-box containing
protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) to diminish its accumulation. Genetic analysis further
revealed that ZTL and its substrate TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) likely act 
downstream of DNA methyltransferases to control circadian rhythm. Together, our
findings support the notion that DNA methylation is important to maintain proper 
circadian pace in Arabidopsis, and further established that SDC links DNA
hypomethylation with a proteolytic cascade to assist in tuning the circadian
clock.

The family of Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulates the stability and
translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we reported that the three members of
PABPs, including PABPC1, PABPC3 and PABPC4, were identified as novel substrates
for MKRN3, whose deletion or loss-of-function mutations were genetically
associated with human central precocious puberty (CPP). MKRN3-mediated
ubiquitination was found to attenuate the binding of PABPs to the poly(A) tails
of mRNA, which led to shortened poly(A) tail-length of GNRH1 mRNA and compromised
the formation of translation initiation complex (TIC). Recently, we have shown
that MKRN3 epigenetically regulates the transcription of GNRH1 through
conjugating poly-Ub chains onto methyl-DNA bind protein 3 (MBD3). Therefore,
MKRN3-mediated ubiquitin signalling could control both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional switches of mammalian puberty initiation. While identifying 
MKRN3 as a novel tissue-specific translational regulator, our work also provided 
new mechanistic insights into the etiology of MKRN3 dysfunction-associated human 
CPP.

Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), encoded by the BANF1 gene, is an
abundant and ubiquitously expressed metazoan protein that has multiple functions 
during the cell cycle. Through its ability to cross-bridge two double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA), it favours chromosome compaction, participates in post-mitotic
nuclear envelope reassembly and is essential for the repair of large nuclear
ruptures. BAF forms a ternary complex with the nuclear envelope proteins lamin
A/C and emerin, and its interaction with lamin A/C is defective in patients with 
recessive accelerated aging syndromes. Phosphorylation of BAF by the
vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a key regulator of BAF localization and
function. Here, we demonstrate that VRK1 successively phosphorylates BAF on Ser4 
and Thr3. The crystal structures of BAF before and after phosphorylation are
extremely similar. However, in solution, the extensive flexibility of the
N-terminal helix α1 and loop α1α2 in BAF is strongly reduced in di-phosphorylated
BAF, due to interactions between the phosphorylated residues and the positively
charged C-terminal helix α6. These regions are involved in DNA and lamin A/C
binding. Consistently, phosphorylation causes a 5000-fold loss of affinity for
dsDNA. However, it does not impair binding to lamin A/C Igfold domain and emerin 
nucleoplasmic region, which leaves open the question of the regulation of these
interactions.

Although overexpression of EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2), is an eminent feature of various cancers, the regulation of its
abundance and function remains insufficiently understood. We report here that the
PRC2 complex is physically associated with ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 in
cancer cells where USP7 acts to deubiquitinate and stabilize EZH2. Interestingly,
we found that USP7-catalyzed H2BK120ub1 deubiquitination is a prerequisite for
chromatin loading of PRC2 thus H3K27 trimethylation, and this process is not
affected by H2AK119 ubiquitination catalyzed by PRC1. Genome-wide analysis of the
transcriptional targets of the USP7/PRC2 complex identified a cohort of genes
including FOXO1 that are involved in cell growth and proliferation. We
demonstrated that the USP7/PRC2 complex drives cancer cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the expression of both USP7
and EZH2 elevates during tumor progression, corresponding to a diminished FOXO1
expression, and the level of the expression of USP7 and EZH2 strongly correlates 
with histological grades and prognosis of tumor patients. These results reveal a 
dual role for USP7 in the regulation of the abundance and function of EZH2,
supporting the pursuit of USP7 as a therapeutic target for cancer intervention.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a terminal disease and the
molecular underpinnings of CRPC development need to be better understood in order
to improve its treatment. Here, we report that a transcription factor Yin Yang 1 
(YY1) is significantly overexpressed during prostate cancer progression.
Functional and cistrome studies of YY1 uncover its roles in promoting prostate
oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as sustaining tumor metabolism
including the Warburg effect and mitochondria respiration. Additionally, our
integrated genomics and interactome profiling in prostate tumor show that YY1 and
bromodomain-containing proteins (BRD2/4) co-occupy a majority of gene-regulatory 
elements, coactivating downstream targets. Via gene loss-of-function and rescue
studies and mutagenesis of YY1-bound cis-elements, we unveil an oncogenic pathway
in which YY1 directly binds and activates PFKP, a gene encoding the rate-limiting
enzyme for glycolysis, significantly contributing to the YY1-enforced Warburg
effect and malignant growth. Altogether, this study supports a master regulator
role for YY1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals a YY1:BRD2/4-PFKP axis
operating in advanced prostate cancer with implications for therapy.

The eIF4E are a family of initiation factors that bind the mRNA 5' cap,
regulating the proteome and the cellular phenotype. eIF4E1 mediates global
translation and its activity is controlled via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR
down-regulation results in eIF4E1 sequestration into an inactive complex with the
4E binding proteins (4EBPs). The second member, eIF4E2, regulates the translatome
during hypoxia. However, the exact function of the third member, eIF4E3, has
remained elusive. We have dissected its function using a range of techniques.
Starting from the observation that it does not interact with 4EBP1, we
demonstrate that eIF4E3 recruitment into an eIF4F complex occurs when Torin1
inhibits the mTOR pathway. Ribo-seq studies demonstrate that this complex
(eIF4FS) is translationally active during stress and that it selects specific
mRNA populations based on 5' TL (UTR) length. The interactome reveals that it
associates with cellular proteins beyond the cognate initiation factors,
suggesting that it may have 'moon-lighting' functions. Finally, we provide
evidence that cellular metabolism is altered in an eIF4E3 KO background but only 
upon Torin1 treatment. We propose that eIF4E3 acts as a second branch of the
integrated stress response, re-programming the translatome to promote 'stress
resistance' and adaptation.

The histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transactions (FACT) functions in
various DNA transactions. How FACT performs these multiple functions remains
largely unknown. Here, we found, for the first time, that the N-terminal domain
of its Spt16 subunit interacts with the Set3 histone deacetylase complex (Set3C) 
and that FACT and Set3C function in the same pathway to regulate gene expression 
in some settings. We observed that Spt16-G132D mutant proteins show defects in
binding to Set3C but not other reported FACT interactors. At the permissive
temperature, induction of the GAL1 and GAL10 genes is reduced in both spt16-G132D
and set3Δ cells, whereas transient upregulation of GAL10 noncoding RNA (ncRNA),
which is transcribed from the 3' end of the GAL10 gene, is elevated. Mutations
that inhibit GAL10 ncRNA transcription reverse the GAL1 and GAL10 induction
defects in spt16-G132D and set3Δ mutant cells. Mechanistically, set3Δ and FACT
(spt16-G132D) mutants show reduced histone acetylation and increased nucleosome
occupancy at the GAL1 promoter under inducing conditions and inhibition of GAL10 
ncRNA transcription also partially reverses these chromatin changes. These
results indicate that FACT interacts with Set3C, which in turn prevents
uncontrolled GAL10 ncRNA expression and fine-tunes the expression of GAL genes
upon a change in carbon source.

Rat1 is a 5'→3' exoribonuclease in budding yeast. It is a highly conserved
protein with homologs being present in fission yeast, flies, worms, mice and
humans. Rat1 and its human homolog Xrn2 have been implicated in multiple nuclear 
processes. Here we report a novel role of Rat1 in mRNA splicing. We observed an
increase in the level of unspliced transcripts in mutants of Rat1. Accumulation
of unspliced transcripts was not due to the surveillance role of Rat1 in
degrading unspliced mRNA, or an indirect effect of Rat1 function in termination
of transcription or on the level of splicing factors in the cell, or due to an
increased elongation rate in Rat1 mutants. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed Rat1
crosslinking to the introns of a subset of yeast genes. Mass spectrometry and
coimmunoprecipitation revealed an interaction of Rat1 with the Clf1, Isy1, Yju2, 
Prp43 and Sub2 splicing factors. Furthermore, recruitment of splicing factors on 
the intron was compromised in the Rat1 mutant. Based on these findings we propose
that Rat1 has a novel role in splicing of mRNA in budding yeast. Rat1, however,
is not a general splicing factor as it crosslinks to only long introns with an
average length of 400 nucleotides.

The intestinal invasion of pathogenic microorganisms can have serious health
consequences. Recent evidence has shown that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA
modification is closely associated with innate immunity; however, the underlying 
mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we examined the function and mechanism of
m6A mRNA modification and the YTH domain-containing protein YTHDF1 (YTH
N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 1) in the innate immune response against
bacterial pathogens in the intestine. Ribo-seq and m6A-seq analyses revealed that
YTHDF1 directs the translation of Traf6 mRNA, which encodes tumor necrosis factor
receptor-associated factor 6, thereby regulating the immune response via the m6A 
modification near the transcript's stop codon. Furthermore, we identified a
unique mechanism by which the P/Q/N-rich domain in YTHDF1 interacts with the DEAD
domain in the host factor DDX60, thereby regulating the intestinal immune
response to bacterial infection by recognizing the target Traf6 transcript. These
results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which YTHDF1 recognizes its 
target and reveal YTHDF1 as an important driver of the intestinal immune
response, opening new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies designed to
modulate the intestinal immune response to bacterial infection.

Faithful genome integrity maintenance plays an essential role in cell survival.
Here, we identify the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 as a key regulator that protects
cells from DNA damage and apoptosis during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced 
stress. We find that ROS significantly induces global mRNA N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) levels by modulating ALKBH5 post-translational modifications (PTMs),
leading to the rapid and efficient induction of thousands of genes involved in a 
variety of biological processes including DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, ROS
promotes ALKBH5 SUMOylation through activating ERK/JNK signaling, leading to
inhibition of ALKBH5 m6A demethylase activity by blocking substrate
accessibility. Moreover, ERK/JNK/ALKBH5-PTMs/m6A axis is activated by ROS in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo in mice, suggesting a
physiological role of this molecular pathway in the maintenance of genome
stability in HSPCs. Together, our study uncovers a molecular mechanism involving 
ALKBH5 PTMs and increased mRNA m6A levels that protect genomic integrity of cells
in response to ROS.

Epigenetics, especially histone marks, functions beyond the DNA sequences to
regulate gene expression. Depletion of NSD1, which catalyzes H3K36me2, leads to
both up- and down-regulation of gene expression, indicating NSD1 is associated
with both active and repressed gene expression. It's known that NSD1 regulates
the deposition and expansion of H3K27me3, a repressive mark for gene expression, 
to keep active gene transcription. However, how NSD1 functions to repress gene
expression is largely unknown. Here, we find that, when NSD1 is knocked out in
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), H3K27ac increases correlatively with the
decrease of H3K36me2 at active enhancers, which is associated with mesoderm
differentiation genes, leading to elevated gene expression. Mechanistically, NSD1
recruits HDAC1, the deacetylase of H3K27ac, to chromatin. Moreover, HDAC1
knockout (KO) recapitulates the increase of H3K27ac at active enhancers as the
NSD1 depletion. Together, we propose that NSD1 deposits H3K36me2 and recruits
HDAC1 at active enhancers to serve as a 'safeguard', preventing further
activation of active enhancer-associated genes.

transcription-blocking DNA damage.

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized
by photosensitivity, developmental defects, neurological abnormalities, and
premature aging. Mutations in CSA (ERCC8), CSB (ERCC6), XPB, XPD, XPG, XPF
(ERCC4) and ERCC1 can give rise to clinical phenotypes resembling classic CS.
Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening approach, we identified LEO1
(Phe381-Ser568 region) as an interacting protein partner of full-length and
C-terminal (Pro1010-Cys1493) CSB in two independent screens. LEO1 is a member of 
the RNA polymerase associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) with roles in
transcription elongation and chromatin modification. Supportive of the Y2H
results, purified, recombinant LEO1 and CSB directly interact in vitro, and the
two proteins exist in a common complex within human cells. In addition,
fluorescently tagged LEO1 and CSB are both recruited to localized DNA damage
sites in human cells. Cell fractionation experiments revealed a
transcription-dependent, coordinated association of LEO1 and CSB to chromatin
following either UVC irradiation or cisplatin treatment of HEK293T cells, whereas
the response to menadione was distinct, suggesting that this collaboration occurs
mainly in the context of bulky transcription-blocking lesions. Consistent with a 
coordinated interaction in DNA repair, LEO1 knockdown or knockout resulted in
reduced CSB recruitment to chromatin, increased sensitivity to UVC light and
cisplatin damage, and reduced RNA synthesis recovery and slower excision of
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers following UVC irradiation; the absence of CSB
resulted in diminished LEO1 recruitment. Our data indicate a reciprocal
communication between CSB and LEO1 in the context of transcription-associated DNA
repair and RNA transcription recovery.

The TREX-TAP pathway is vital for mRNA export. For spliced mRNA, the TREX complex
is recruited during splicing; however, for intronless mRNA, recruitment is
sequence dependent. However, the export of cytoplasmic long noncoding RNA
(lncRNA) is poorly characterized. We report the identification of a cytoplasmic
accumulation region (CAR-N) in the intronless lncRNA, NKILA. CAR-N removal led to
strong nuclear retention of NKILA, and CAR-N insertion promoted the export of
cDNA transcripts. In vitro RNP purification via CAR-N, mass spectrometry, and
siRNA screening revealed that SRSF1 and SRSF7 were vital to NKILA export, and
identified a cluster of SRSF1/7 binding sites within a 55 nucleotide sequence in 
CAR-N. Significant nuclear enrichment of NKILA was observed for NKILA lacking
CAR-N or the cluster of binding sites in knock-in models. Depletion of TREX-TAP
pathway components resulted in strong nuclear retention of NKILA. RNA and protein
immunoprecipitation verified that SRSF1/7 were bound to NKILA and interacted with
UAP56 and ALYREF. Moreover, NKILA lacking CAR-N was unable to inhibit breast
cancer cell migration. We concluded that the binding of SRSF1/7 to clustered
motifs in CAR-N facilitated TREX recruitment, promoting the export of NKILA, and 
confirmed the importance of NKILA localization to its function.

The biogenesis of small uridine-rich nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs) depends
on the methylation of Sm proteins catalyzed by the methylosome and the subsequent
action of the SMN complex, which assembles the heptameric Sm protein ring onto
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). In this sophisticated process, the methylosome
subunit pICln (chloride conductance regulatory protein) is attributed to an
exceptional key position as an 'assembly chaperone' by building up a stable
precursor Sm protein ring structure. Here, we show that-apart from its autophagic
role-the Ser/Thr kinase ULK1 (Uncoordinated [unc-51] Like Kinase 1) functions as 
a novel key regulator in UsnRNP biogenesis by phosphorylation of the C-terminus
of pICln. As a consequence, phosphorylated pICln is no longer capable to hold up 
the precursor Sm ring structure. Consequently, inhibition of ULK1 results in a
reduction of efficient UsnRNP core assembly. Thus ULK1, depending on its complex 
formation, exerts different functions in autophagy or snRNP biosynthesis.

RNA-protein interactions are central to all gene expression processes and
contribute to a variety of human diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting
RNA-protein interactions have shown promising effects on some diseases that are
previously regarded as 'incurable'. Here, we developed a fluorescent on-bead
screening platform, RNA Pull-Down COnfocal NAnoscanning (RP-CONA), to identify
RNA-protein interaction modulators in eukaryotic cell extracts. Using RP-CONA, we
identified small molecules that disrupt the interaction between HuR, an inhibitor
of brain-enriched miR-7 biogenesis, and the conserved terminal loop of
pri-miR-7-1. Importantly, miR-7's primary target is an mRNA of α-synuclein, which
contributes to the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Our method identified a
natural product quercetin as a molecule able to upregulate cellular miR-7 levels 
and downregulate the expression of α-synuclein. This opens up new therapeutic
avenues towards treatment of Parkinson's disease as well as provides a novel
methodology to search for modulators of RNA-protein interaction.

Speckle-type Poz protein (SPOP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, is the most
frequently mutated gene in prostate cancer. The SPOP-mutated subtype of prostate 
cancer shows high genomic instability, but the underlying mechanisms causing this
phenotype are still largely unknown. Here, we report that upon DNA damage, SPOP
is phosphorylated at Ser119 by the ATM serine/threonine kinase, which potentiates
the binding of SPOP to homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2),
resulting in a nondegradative ubiquitination of HIPK2. This modification
subsequently increases the phosphorylation activity of HIPK2 toward HP1γ, and
then promotes the dissociation of HP1γ from trimethylated (Lys9) histone H3
(H3K9me3) to initiate DNA damage repair. Moreover, the effect of SPOP on the
HIPK2-HP1γ axis is abrogated by prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations. Our
findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SPOP
mutations-driven genomic instability in prostate cancer.

Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is a major plasma selenoprotein that contains 10 Sec
residues, which is encoded by the UGA stop codon. The mRNA for SELENOP has the
unique property of containing two Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, which 
is located in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Here, we coincidentally
identified a novel gene, CCDC152, by sequence analysis. This gene was located in 
the antisense region of the SELENOP gene, including the 3'UTR region in the
genome. We demonstrated that this novel gene functioned as a long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) that decreased SELENOP protein levels via translational rather than
transcriptional, regulation. We found that the CCDC152 RNA interacted
specifically and directly with the SELENOP mRNA and inhibited its binding to the 
SECIS-binding protein 2, resulting in the decrease of ribosome binding. We termed
this novel gene product lncRNA inhibitor of SELENOP translation (L-IST). Finally,
we found that epigallocatechin gallate upregulated L-IST in vitro and in vivo, to
suppress SELENOP protein levels. Here, we provide a new regulatory mechanism of
SELENOP translation by an endogenous long antisense ncRNA.

Reinitiation supporting protein, RISP, interacts with 60S (60S ribosomal subunit)
and eIF3 (eukaryotic initiation factor 3) in plants. TOR (target-of-rapamycin)
mediates RISP phosphorylation at residue Ser267, favoring its binding to eL24
(60S ribosomal protein L24). In a viral context, RISP, when phosphorylated, binds
the CaMV transactivator/ viroplasmin, TAV, to assist in an exceptional mechanism 
of reinitiation after long ORF translation. Moreover, we show here that RISP
interacts with eIF2 via eIF2β and TOR downstream target 40S ribosomal protein
eS6. A RISP phosphorylation knockout, RISP-S267A, binds preferentially eIF2β, and
both form a ternary complex with eIF3a in vitro. Accordingly, transient
overexpression in plant protoplasts of RISP-S267A, but not a RISP phosphorylation
mimic, RISP-S267D, favors translation initiation. In contrast, RISP-S267D
preferentially binds eS6, and, when bound to the C-terminus of eS6, can capture
60S in a highly specific manner in vitro, suggesting that it mediates 60S loading
during reinitiation. Indeed, eS6-deficient plants are highly resistant to CaMV
due to their reduced reinitiation capacity. Strikingly, an eS6 phosphomimic, when
stably expressed in eS6-deficient plants, can fully restore the reinitiation
deficiency of these plants in cellular and viral contexts. These results suggest 
that RISP function in translation (re)initiation is regulated by phosphorylation 
at Ser267.

Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a master kinase that regulates cell cycle
progression. How its enzymatic activity is regulated in response to DNA damage is
not fully understood. We show that PLK1 is enriched at double strand breaks
(DSBs) within seconds of UV laser irradiation in a PARP-1-dependent manner and
then disperses within 10 min in a PARG-dependent manner. Poly(ADP-)ribose (PAR)
chains directly bind to PLK1 in vitro and inhibit its enzymatic activity.
CHK1-mediated PLK1 phosphorylation at S137 prevents its binding to PAR and
recruitment to DSBs but ensures PLK1 phosphorylation at T210 and its enzymatic
activity toward RAD51 at S14. This subsequent phosphorylation event at S14 primes
RAD51 for CHK1-mediated phosphorylation at T309, which is essential for full
RAD51 activation. This CHK1-PLK1-RAD51 axis ultimately promotes homologous
recombination (HR)-mediated repair and ensures chromosome stability and cellular 
radiosensitivity. These findings provide biological insight for combined cancer
therapy using inhibitors of PARG and CHK1.

Despite its prominence, the mechanisms through which the tumor suppressor p53
regulates most genes remain unclear. Recently, the regulatory factor X 7 (RFX7)
emerged as a suppressor of lymphoid neoplasms, but its regulation and target
genes mediating tumor suppression remain unknown. Here, we identify a novel
p53-RFX7 signaling axis. Integrative analysis of the RFX7 DNA binding landscape
and the RFX7-regulated transcriptome in three distinct cell systems reveals that 
RFX7 directly controls multiple established tumor suppressors, including PDCD4,
PIK3IP1, MXD4, and PNRC1, across cell types and is the missing link for their
activation in response to p53 and stress. RFX7 target gene expression correlates 
with cell differentiation and better prognosis in numerous cancer types.
Interestingly, we find that RFX7 sensitizes cells to Doxorubicin by promoting
apoptosis. Together, our work establishes RFX7's role as a ubiquitous regulator
of cell growth and fate determination and a key node in the p53 transcriptional
program.

Heterochromatin binding protein HP1β plays an important role in chromatin
organization and cell differentiation, however the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. Here, we generated HP1β-/- embryonic stem cells and observed reduced
heterochromatin clustering and impaired differentiation. We found that during
stem cell differentiation, HP1β is phosphorylated at serine 89 by CK2, which
creates a binding site for the pluripotency regulator KAP1. This phosphorylation 
dependent sequestration of KAP1 in heterochromatin compartments causes a
downregulation of pluripotency factors and triggers pluripotency exit.
Accordingly, HP1β-/- and phospho-mutant cells exhibited impaired differentiation,
while ubiquitination-deficient KAP1-/- cells had the opposite phenotype with
enhanced differentiation. These results suggest that KAP1 regulates pluripotency 
via its ubiquitination activity. We propose that the formation of subnuclear
membraneless heterochromatin compartments may serve as a dynamic reservoir to
trap or release cellular factors. The sequestration of essential regulators
defines a novel and active role of heterochromatin in gene regulation and
represents a dynamic mode of remote control to regulate cellular processes like
cell fate decisions.

A major stress response influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs) is senescence, a state
of indefinite growth arrest triggered by sublethal cell damage. Here, through
bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, we identified miR-340-5p as a
novel miRNA that foments cellular senescence. miR-340-5p was highly abundant in
diverse senescence models, and miR-340-5p overexpression in proliferating cells
rendered them senescent. Among the target mRNAs, miR-340-5p prominently reduced
the levels of LBR mRNA, encoding lamin B receptor (LBR). Loss of LBR by ectopic
overexpression of miR-340-5p derepressed heterochromatin in lamina-associated
domains, promoting the expression of DNA repetitive elements characteristic of
senescence. Importantly, overexpressing miR-340-5p enhanced cellular sensitivity 
to senolytic compounds, while antagonization of miR-340-5p reduced senescent cell
markers and engendered resistance to senolytic-induced cell death. We propose
that miR-340-5p can be exploited for removing senescent cells to restore tissue
homeostasis and mitigate damage by senescent cells in pathologies of human aging.

The yeast cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous
serine-threonine kinase, encompassing three catalytic (Tpk1-3) and one regulatory
(Bcy1) subunits. Evidence suggests PKA involvement in DNA damage checkpoint
response, but how DNA repair pathways are regulated by PKA subunits remains
inconclusive. Here, we report that deleting the tpk1 catalytic subunit reduces
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) efficiency, whereas tpk2-3 and bcy1 deletion
does not. Epistatic analyses revealed that tpk1, as well as the DNA damage
checkpoint kinase (dun1) and NHEJ factor (nej1), co-function in the same pathway,
and parallel to the NHEJ factor yku80. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
resection data suggest that tpk1 deletion influences repair protein recruitments 
and DNA resection. Further, we show that Tpk1 phosphorylation of Nej1 at S298 (a 
Dun1 phosphosite) is indispensable for NHEJ repair and nuclear targeting of Nej1 
and its binding partner Lif1. In mammalian cells, loss of PRKACB (human homolog
of Tpk1) also reduced NHEJ efficiency, and similarly, PRKACB was found to
phosphorylate XLF (a Nej1 human homolog) at S263, a corresponding residue of the 
yeast Nej1 S298. Together, our results uncover a new and conserved mechanism for 
Tpk1 and PRKACB in phosphorylating Nej1 (or XLF), which is critically required
for NHEJ repair.

Newly synthesized mRNA is translated during its export through the nuclear pore
complex, when its 5'-cap structure is still bound by the nuclear cap-binding
complex (CBC), a heterodimer of cap-binding protein (CBP) 80 and CBP20. Despite
its critical role in mRNA surveillance, the mechanism by which CBC-dependent
translation (CT) is regulated remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the CT
initiation factor (CTIF) is tethered in a translationally incompetent manner to
the perinuclear region by the DEAD-box helicase 19B (DDX19B). DDX19B hands over
CTIF to CBP80, which is associated with the 5'-cap of a newly exported mRNA. The 
resulting CBP80-CTIF complex then initiates CT in the perinuclear region. We also
show that impeding the interaction between CTIF and DDX19B leads to uncontrolled 
CT throughout the cytosol, consequently dysregulating nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Altogether, our data provide molecular evidence supporting the importance 
of tight control of local translation in the perinuclear region.

Adaptation to nutrient availability is crucial for survival. Upon nutritional
stress, such as during prolonged fasting or cold exposure, organisms need to
balance the feeding of tissues and the maintenance of body temperature. The
mechanisms that regulate the adaptation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a key
organ for non-shivering thermogenesis, to variations in nutritional state are not
known. Here we report that specific deletion of the activin receptor ALK7 in BAT 
resulted in fasting-induced hypothermia due to exaggerated catabolic activity in 
brown adipocytes. After overnight fasting, BAT lacking ALK7 showed increased
expression of genes responsive to nutrient stress, including the upstream
regulator KLF15, aminoacid catabolizing enzymes, notably proline dehydrogenase
(POX), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), as well as markedly reduced lipid 
droplet size. In agreement with this, ligand stimulation of ALK7 suppressed POX
and KLF15 expression in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Treatment of
mutant mice with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 restored KLF15 and 
POX expression levels in mutant BAT, suggesting that loss of BAT ALK7 results in 
excessive activation of glucocorticoid signaling upon fasting. These results
reveal a novel signaling pathway downstream of ALK7 which regulates the
adaptation of BAT to nutrient availability by limiting nutrient stress-induced
overactivation of catabolic responses in brown adipocytes.

The intermediate filament protein keratin 14 (K14) provides vital structural
support in basal keratinocytes of epidermis. Recent studies evidenced a role for 
K14-dependent disulfide bonding in the organization and dynamics of keratin IFs
in skin keratinocytes. Here we report that knock-in mice harboring a
cysteine-to-alanine substitution at Krt14's codon 373 (C373A) exhibit alterations
in disulfide-bonded K14 species and a barrier defect secondary to enhanced
proliferation, faster transit time and altered differentiation in epidermis. A
proteomics screen identified 14-3-3 as K14 interacting proteins. Follow-up
studies showed that YAP1, a transcriptional effector of Hippo signaling regulated
by 14-3-3sigma in skin keratinocytes, shows aberrant subcellular partitioning and
function in differentiating Krt14 C373A keratinocytes. Residue C373 in K14, which
is conserved in a subset of keratins, is revealed as a novel regulator of keratin
organization and YAP function in early differentiating keratinocytes, with an
impact on cell mechanics, homeostasis and barrier function in epidermis.

Endosomes and lysosomes harbor Rab5 and Rab7 on their surface as key proteins
involved in their identity, biogenesis, and fusion. Rab activation requires a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is Mon1-Ccz1 for Rab7. During
endosome maturation, Rab5 is replaced by Rab7, though the underlying mechanism
remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular determinants for Rab
conversion in vivo and in vitro, and reconstitute Rab7 activation with yeast and 
metazoan proteins. We show (i) that Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, (ii) that
membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent
Rab7 activation and Rab7-dependent membrane fusion, and (iii) that this process
is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and
blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery
of the endosomal Rab cascade and a novel regulatory mechanism controlling this
pathway.

Modulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-localized inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) Ca2+-release
channels is a universal signaling pathway that regulates numerous
cell-physiological processes. Whereas much is known regarding regulation of
InsP3R activity by cytoplasmic ligands and processes, its regulation by
ER-luminal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]ER) is poorly understood and controversial. 
We discovered that the InsP3R is regulated by a peripheral membrane-associated
ER-luminal protein that strongly inhibits the channel in the presence of high,
physiological [Ca2+]ER. The widely-expressed Ca2+-binding protein annexin A1
(ANXA1) is present in the nuclear envelope lumen and, through interaction with a 
luminal region of the channel, can modify high-[Ca2+]ER inhibition of InsP3R
activity. Genetic knockdown of ANXA1 expression enhanced global and local
elementary InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling events. Thus, [Ca2+]ER is a major
regulator of InsP3R channel activity and InsP3R-mediated [Ca2+]i signaling in
cells by controlling an interaction of the channel with a peripheral
membrane-associated Ca2+-binding protein, likely ANXA1.

Progressive telomere shortening during lifespan is associated with restriction of
cell proliferation, genome instability and aging. Apoptosis and senescence are
the two major outcomes upon irreversible cellular damage. Here, we show a
transition of these two cell fates during aging of telomerase deficient
zebrafish. In young telomerase mutants, proliferative tissues exhibit DNA damage 
and p53-dependent apoptosis, but no senescence. However, these tissues in older
animals display loss of cellularity and senescence becomes predominant. Tissue
alterations are accompanied by a pro-proliferative stimulus mediated by AKT
signaling. Upon AKT activation, FoxO transcription factors are phosphorylated and
translocated out of the nucleus. This results in reduced SOD2 expression causing 
an increase of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations induce p15/16
growth arrest and senescence. We propose that, upon telomere shortening, early
apoptosis leads to cell depletion and insufficient compensatory proliferation.
Following tissue damage, the mTOR/AKT is activated causing mitochondrial
dysfunction and p15/16-dependent senescence.

Studies have suggested that amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic
homeostasis, but the evidence has not been consistent. In particular, signaling
pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain
to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding 
protein involved in Huntington's disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we
used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP
transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found
that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport
in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased
axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and
increased synaptic density. Ablating in vivo HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, 
which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number
and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP
thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.

Integrating differential RNA and miRNA expression during neuronal lineage
induction of human embryonic stem cells we identified miR-934, a primate-specific
miRNA that displays a stage-specific expression pattern during progenitor
expansion and early neuron generation. We demonstrate the biological relevance of
this finding by comparison with data from early to mid-gestation human cortical
tissue. Further we find that miR-934 directly controls progenitor to neuroblast
transition and impacts on neurite growth of newborn neurons. In agreement,
miR-934 targets are involved in progenitor proliferation and neuronal
differentiation whilst miR-934 inhibition results in profound global
transcriptome changes associated with neurogenesis, axonogenesis, neuronal
migration and neurotransmission. Interestingly, miR-934 inhibition affects the
expression of genes associated with the subplate zone, a transient compartment
most prominent in primates that emerges during early corticogenesis. Our data
suggest that mir-934 is a novel regulator of early human neurogenesis with
potential implications for a species-specific evolutionary role in brain
function.

Yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1 stimulates translation initiation, particularly of
mRNAs with structured 5'UTRs. Interactions of the Ded1 N-terminal domain (NTD)
with eIF4A, and Ded1-CTD with eIF4G, subunits of eIF4F, enhance Ded1 unwinding
activity and stimulation of preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly in vitro.
However, the importance of these interactions, and of Ded1-eIF4E association, in 
vivo were poorly understood. We identified separate amino acid clusters in the
Ded1-NTD required for binding to eIF4A or eIF4E in vitro. Disrupting each cluster
selectively impairs native Ded1 association with eIF4A or eIF4E, and reduces cell
growth, polysome assembly, and translation of reporter mRNAs with structured
5'UTRs. It also impairs Ded1 stimulation of PIC assembly on a structured mRNA in 
vitro. Ablating Ded1 interactions with eIF4A/eIF4E unveiled a requirement for the
Ded1-CTD for robust initiation. Thus, Ded1 function in vivo is stimulated by
independent interactions of its NTD with eIF4E and eIF4A, and its CTD with eIF4G.

MCL1 has critical antiapoptotic functions and its levels are tightly regulated by
ubiquitylation and degradation, but mechanisms that drive this degradation,
particularly in solid tumors, remain to be established. We show here in prostate 
cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an
integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the
mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this
NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1
degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent
targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid
tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not strongly
sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to
BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also 
be exploited in tumors with MARCH5 genomic loss.

EDC4 is a core component of processing (P)-bodies that binds the DCP2 decapping
enzyme and stimulates mRNA decay. EDC4 also interacts with mammalian MARF1, a
recently identified endoribonuclease that promotes oogenesis and contains a
number of RNA binding domains, including two RRMs and multiple LOTUS domains. How
EDC4 regulates MARF1 action and the identity of MARF1 target mRNAs is not known. 
Our transcriptome-wide analysis identifies bona fide MARF1 target mRNAs and
indicates that MARF1 predominantly binds their 3' UTRs via its LOTUS domains to
promote their decay. We also show that a MARF1 RRM plays an essential role in
enhancing its endonuclease activity. Importantly, we establish that EDC4 impairs 
MARF1 activity by preventing its LOTUS domains from binding target mRNAs. Thus,
EDC4 not only serves as an enhancer of mRNA turnover that binds DCP2, but also as
a repressor that binds MARF1 to prevent the decay of MARF1 target mRNAs.

particularly in the hippocampus, where its functions are largely unknown. One of 
its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and
strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown
in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for
hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory 
retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced
upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and
c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic
administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory
retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal
CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate
of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for
memory enhancement.

Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are proteins whose expression is normally restricted 
to germ cells yet aberrantly activated in tumors, where their functions remain
relatively cryptic. Here we report that ZNF165, a CT antigen frequently expressed
in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), associates with SMAD3 to modulate
transcription of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-dependent genes and thereby 
promote growth and survival of human TNBC cells. In addition, we identify the
KRAB zinc finger protein, ZNF446, and its associated tripartite motif protein,
TRIM27, as obligate components of the ZNF165-SMAD3 complex that also support
tumor cell viability. Importantly, we find that TRIM27 alone is necessary for
ZNF165 transcriptional activity and is required for TNBC tumor growth in vivo
using an orthotopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. Our findings
indicate that aberrant expression of a testis-specific transcription factor is
sufficient to co-opt somatic transcriptional machinery to drive a pro-tumorigenic
gene expression program in TNBC.

The DNA damage response (DDR) is a highly orchestrated process but how
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are initially recognized is unclear. Here, we
show that polymerized SIRT6 deacetylase recognizes DSBs and potentiates the DDR
in human and mouse cells. First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which
is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then,
K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to γH2AX, allowing its retention on and subsequent
remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that mimics
hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of SIRT1
deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action between
SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair in humans and
mice.

Cell-intrinsic and extrinsic signals regulate the state and fate of stem and
progenitor cells. Recent advances in metabolomics illustrate that various
metabolic pathways are also important in regulating stem cell fate. However, our 
understanding of the metabolic control of the state and fate of progenitor cells 
is in its infancy. Using Drosophila hematopoietic organ: lymph gland, we
demonstrate that Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) is essential for the differentiation 
of blood cell progenitors. In the absence of FAO, the progenitors are unable to
differentiate and exhibit altered histone acetylation. Interestingly, acetate
supplementation rescues both histone acetylation and the differentiation defects.
We further show that the CPT1/whd (withered), the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, is
transcriptionally regulated by Jun-Kinase (JNK), which has been previously
implicated in progenitor differentiation. Our study thus reveals how the cellular
signaling machinery integrates with the metabolic cue to facilitate the
differentiation program.

plain-language-summary: Stem cells are special precursor cells, found in all
animals from flies to humans, that can give rise to all the mature cell types in 
the body. Their job is to generate supplies of new cells wherever these are
needed. This is important because it allows damaged or worn-out tissues to be
repaired and replaced by fresh, healthy cells. As part of this renewal process,
stem cells generate pools of more specialized cells, called progenitor cells.
These can be thought of as half-way to maturation and can only develop in a more 
restricted number of ways. For example, so-called myeloid progenitor cells from
humans can only develop into a specific group of blood cell types, collectively
termed the myeloid lineage. Fruit flies, like many other animals, also have
several different types of blood cells. The fly’s repertoire of blood cells is
very similar to the human myeloid lineage, and these cells also develop from the 
fly equivalent of myeloid progenitor cells. These progenitors are found in a
specialized organ in fruit fly larvae called the lymph gland, where the blood
forms. These similarities between fruit flies and humans mean that flies are a
good model to study how myeloid progenitor cells mature. A lot is already known
about the molecules that signal to progenitor cells how and when to mature.
However, the role of metabolism – the chemical reactions that process nutrients
and provide energy inside cells – is still poorly understood. Tiwari et al. set
out to identify which metabolic reactions myeloid progenitor cells require and
how these reactions might shape the progenitors’ development into mature blood
cells. The experiments in this study used fruit fly larvae that had been
genetically altered so that they could no longer perform key chemical reactions
needed for the breakdown of fats. In these mutant larvae, the progenitors within 
the lymph gland could not give rise to mature blood cells. This showed that
myeloid progenitor cells need to be able to break down fats in order to develop
properly. These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for metabolism 
in controlling the development of progenitor cells. If this effect also occurs in
humans, this knowledge could one day help medical researchers engineer
replacement tissues in the lab, or even increase our own bodies’ ability to
regenerate blood, and potentially other organs.

The genome-scale transcriptional programs that specify the mammalian trachea and 
esophagus are unknown. Though NKX2-1 and SOX2 are hypothesized to be
co-repressive master regulators of tracheoesophageal fates, this is untested at a
whole transcriptomic scale and their downstream networks remain unidentified. By 
combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with bulk RNA-sequencing of Nkx2-1 mutants
and NKX2-1 ChIP-sequencing in mouse embryos, we delineate the NKX2-1
transcriptional program in tracheoesophageal specification, and discover that the
majority of the tracheal and esophageal transcriptome is NKX2-1 independent. To
decouple the NKX2-1 transcriptional program from regulation by SOX2, we
interrogate the expression of newly-identified tracheal and esophageal markers in
Sox2/Nkx2-1 compound mutants. Finally, we discover that NKX2-1 binds directly to 
Shh and Wnt7b and regulates their expression to control mesenchymal specification
to cartilage and smooth muscle, coupling epithelial identity with mesenchymal
specification. These findings create a new framework for understanding early
tracheoesophageal fate specification at the genome-wide level.

plain-language-summary: The trachea or windpipe is a tube that connects the
throat to the lungs, while the esophagus connects the throat to the stomach. The 
trachea has cartilage rings that help to ensure clear airflow to the lungs, while
the esophagus walls are lined with muscles that help to move food to the stomach.
Although there are many differences between them, both the trachea and esophagus 
form from the same group of cells during development. Proteins called
transcription factors help to control the formation of different body parts by
switching different groups of genes on and off in different subsets of cells.
Existing research has suggested that a transcription factor called NKX2.1 drives 
trachea formation, while another, called SOX2, is important in esophagus
formation. An absence of either of these two proteins is thought to be associated
with serious birth defects including loss of the trachea or esophagus, or failure
of the two to separate fully. How these two transcription factors interact and
drive the development of the trachea and esophagus, however, is currently
unclear. Kuwahara et al. used mice to study the role of NKX2.1 and SOX2 in the
formation of the trachea and esophagus. The findings identify many new genes that
are active in the trachea and esophagus and reveal that NKX2.1 is not a master
regulator that controls all of the genes involved in trachea formation. However, 
NKX2.1 does control several key genes, particularly those involved in forming
cartilage in the trachea instead of muscle in the esophagus. The investigation
also revealed many genes that are not controlled by NKX2.1 suggesting that other,
currently unknown, systems play a major role in trachea formation. More work is
required to understand the wider genetic regulators involved in differentiating
the trachea from the esophagus. The findings in this study will help researchers 
to understand birth defects in the trachea and esophagus that result from genetic
errors. They also reveal information about gene regulation processes that are
relevant to the formation of other body parts and in the context of other
diseases. In the long term, they could support regenerative medicine to regrow or
replace lost or damaged body parts using lab-grown stem cells.

We have previously demonstrated that checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) is a critical
negative regulator of androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, prostate
cancer (PCa) cell growth, and androgen sensitivity. We have now uncovered that
the AR directly interacts with CHK2 and ionizing radiation (IR) increases this
interaction. This IR-induced increase in AR-CHK2 interactions requires AR
phosphorylation and CHK2 kinase activity. PCa associated CHK2 mutants with
impaired kinase activity reduced IR-induced AR-CHK2 interactions. The
destabilization of AR - CHK2 interactions induced by CHK2 variants impairs CHK2
negative regulation of cell growth. CHK2 depletion increases transcription of
DNAPK and RAD54, increases clonogenic survival, and increases resolution of DNA
double strand breaks. The data support a model where CHK2 sequesters the AR
through direct binding decreasing AR transcription and suppressing PCa cell
growth. CHK2 mutation or loss of expression thereby leads to increased AR
transcriptional activity and survival in response to DNA damage.

Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane
regulate essential cellular activities including protein quality control, calcium
flux, and sterol homeostasis. At least 25 different, transmembrane domain
(TMD)-containing E3s are predicted to be ER-localised, but for most their
organisation and cellular roles remain poorly defined. Using a comparative
proteomic workflow, we mapped over 450 protein-protein interactions for 21 stably
expressed, full-length E3s. Bioinformatic analysis linked ER-E3s and their
interactors to multiple homeostatic, regulatory, and metabolic pathways. Among
these were four membrane-embedded interactors of RNF26, a polytopic E3 whose
abundance is auto-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. RNF26 
co-assembles with TMEM43, ENDOD1, TMEM33 and TMED1 to form a complex capable of
modulating innate immune signalling through the cGAS-STING pathway. This RNF26
complex represents a new modulatory axis of STING and innate immune signalling at
the ER membrane. Collectively, these data reveal the broad scope of regulation
and differential functionalities mediated by ER-E3s for both membrane-tethered
and cytoplasmic processes.

Organ growth and size are finely tuned by intrinsic and extrinsic signaling
molecules. In Drosophila, the BMP family member Dpp is produced in a limited set 
of imaginal disc cells and functions as a classic morphogen to regulate pattern
and growth by diffusing throughout imaginal discs. However, the role of
TGFβ/Activin-like ligands in disc growth control remains ill-defined. Here, we
demonstrate that Myoglianin (Myo), an Activin family member, and a close homolog 
of mammalian Myostatin (Mstn), is a muscle-derived extrinsic factor that uses
canonical dSmad2-mediated signaling to regulate wing size. We propose that Myo is
a myokine that helps mediate an allometric relationship between muscles and their
associated appendages.

Endogenous circadian clocks have evolved to anticipate 24 hr rhythms in
environmental demands. Recent studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruption is
a major risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders in humans.
Conversely, alterations in energy state can disrupt circadian rhythms of behavior
and physiology, creating a vicious circle of metabolic dysfunction. How
peripheral energy state affects diurnal food intake, however, is still poorly
understood. We here show that the adipokine adiponectin (ADIPOQ) regulates
diurnal feeding rhythms through clocks in energy regulatory centers of the
mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). Adipoq-deficient mice show increased rest phase
food intake associated with disrupted transcript rhythms of clock and
appetite-regulating genes in the MBH. ADIPOQ regulates MBH clocks via
AdipoR1-mediated upregulation of the core clock gene Bmal1. BMAL1, in turn,
controls expression of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the MBH. Together,
these data reveal a systemic metabolic circuit to regulate central circadian
clocks and energy intake.

Genome-wide association studies identified the BIN1 locus as a leading modulator 
of genetic risk in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One limitation in understanding
BIN1's contribution to AD is its unknown function in the brain. AD-associated
BIN1 variants are generally noncoding and likely change expression. Here, we
determined the effects of increasing expression of the major neuronal isoform of 
human BIN1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Higher BIN1 induced network
hyperexcitability on multielectrode arrays, increased frequency of synaptic
transmission, and elevated calcium transients, indicating that increasing BIN1
drives greater neuronal activity. In exploring the mechanism of these effects on 
neuronal physiology, we found that BIN1 interacted with L-type voltage-gated
calcium channels (LVGCCs) and that BIN1-LVGCC interactions were modulated by Tau 
in rat hippocampal neurons and mouse brain. Finally, Tau reduction prevented
BIN1-induced network hyperexcitability. These data shed light on BIN1's neuronal 
function and suggest that it may contribute to Tau-dependent hyperexcitability in
AD.

Peroxiredoxins are H2O2 scavenging enzymes that also carry out H2O2 signaling and
chaperone functions. In yeast, the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1 is
required for both promoting resistance to H2O2 and extending lifespan upon
caloric restriction. We show here that Tsa1 effects both these functions not by
scavenging H2O2, but by repressing the nutrient signaling Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway at
the level of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme. Tsa1 stimulates sulfenylation of 
cysteines in the PKA catalytic subunit by H2O2 and a significant proportion of
the catalytic subunits are glutathionylated on two cysteine residues. Redox
modification of the conserved Cys243 inhibits the phosphorylation of a conserved 
Thr241 in the kinase activation loop and enzyme activity, and preventing Thr241
phosphorylation can overcome the H2O2 sensitivity of Tsa1-deficient cells.
Results support a model of aging where nutrient signaling pathways constitute
hubs integrating information from multiple aging-related conduits, including a
peroxiredoxin-dependent response to H2O2.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs plethora of mechanisms to hijack the
host defence machinery for its successful survival, proliferation and
persistence. Here, we show that Mtb upregulates one of the key epigenetic
modulators, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), which upon
infection translocate to the nucleus and deacetylates histone H3K18, thus
modulating the host transcriptome leading to enhanced macrophage activation.
Furthermore, in Mtb specific T cells, SIRT2 deacetylates NFκB-p65 at K310 to
modulate T helper cell differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2
restricts the intracellular growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains
of Mtb and enhances the efficacy of front line anti-TB drug Isoniazid in the
murine model of infection. SIRT2 inhibitor-treated mice display reduced bacillary
load, decreased disease pathology and increased Mtb-specific protective immune
responses. Overall, this study provides a link between Mtb infection, epigenetics
and host immune response, which can be exploited to achieve therapeutic benefits.

During endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), the cytoplasmic
enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is proposed to remove N-glycans from misfolded
N-glycoproteins after their retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol. We
previously reported that NGLY1 regulates Drosophila BMP signaling in a
tissue-specific manner (Galeone et al., 2017). Here, we establish the Drosophila 
Dpp and its mouse ortholog BMP4 as biologically relevant targets of NGLY1 and
find, unexpectedly, that NGLY1-mediated deglycosylation of misfolded BMP4 is
required for its retrotranslocation. Accumulation of misfolded BMP4 in the ER
results in ER stress and prompts the ER recruitment of NGLY1. The ER-associated
NGLY1 then deglycosylates misfolded BMP4 molecules to promote their
retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation, thereby allowing properly-folded 
BMP4 molecules to proceed through the secretory pathway and activate signaling in
other cells. Our study redefines the role of NGLY1 during ERAD and suggests that 
impaired BMP4 signaling might underlie some of the NGLY1 deficiency patient
phenotypes.

R-spondin1 (Rspo1) has been featured as a Wnt agonist, serving as a potent niche 
factor for stem cells in many tissues. Here we unveil a novel role of Rspo1 in
promoting estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) expression, hence regulating the output 
of steroid hormone signaling in the mouse mammary gland. This action of Rspo1
relies on the receptor Lgr4 and intracellular cAMP-PKA signaling, yet is
independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These mechanisms were reinforced by
genetic evidence. Luminal cells-specific knockout of Rspo1 results in decreased
Esr1 expression and reduced mammary side branches. In contrast, luminal
cells-specific knockout of Wnt4, while attenuating basal cell Wnt/β-catenin
signaling activities, enhances Esr1 expression. Our data reveal a novel
Wnt-independent role of Rspo1, in which Rspo1 acts as a bona fide GPCR activator 
eliciting intracellular cAMP signaling. The identification of Rspo1-ERα signaling
axis may have a broad implication in estrogen-associated diseases.

Intracellular transport undergoes remodeling upon cell differentiation, which
involves cell type-specific regulators. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible
kinase (BMP2K) has been potentially implicated in endocytosis and cell
differentiation but its molecular functions remained unknown. We discovered that 
its longer (L) and shorter (S) splicing variants regulate erythroid
differentiation in a manner unexplainable by their involvement in AP-2 adaptor
phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, both variants interact with SEC16A and 
could localize to the juxtanuclear secretory compartment. Variant-specific
depletion approach showed that BMP2K isoforms constitute a BMP2K-L/S regulatory
system that controls the distribution of SEC16A and SEC24B as well as SEC31A
abundance at COPII assemblies. Finally, we found L to promote and S to restrict
autophagic degradation and erythroid differentiation. Hence, we propose that
BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S differentially regulate abundance and distribution of COPII
assemblies as well as autophagy, possibly thereby fine-tuning erythroid
differentiation.

Molecular-glue degraders mediate interactions between target proteins and
components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause selective protein
degradation. Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by
high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic
screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show
that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3
ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of
CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 
compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12
substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death.
Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a
5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with
improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its
target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific
receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.

Endothelial Tie2 signaling plays a pivotal role in vascular barrier maintenance
at baseline and after injury. We previously demonstrated that a sharp drop in
Tie2 expression observed across various murine models of critical illnesses is
associated with increased vascular permeability and mortality. Matrix
metalloprotease (MMP)-14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain shedding has recently been
recognized as a possible mechanism for Tie2 downregulation in sepsis. Here, we
identified the exact MMP14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain cleavage sites and could show
that pharmacological MMP14 blockade in experimental murine sepsis exerts barrier 
protective and anti-inflammatory effects predominantly through the attenuation of
Tie2 cleavage to improve survival both in a pre-treatment and rescue approach.
Overall, we show that protecting Tie2 shedding might offer a new therapeutic
opportunity for the treatment of septic vascular leakage.

Most of peroxisomal matrix proteins including a hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2)-decomposing enzyme, catalase, are imported in a peroxisome-targeting
signal type-1 (PTS1)-dependent manner. However, little is known about regulation 
of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a
central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane,
is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H2O2 in mammalian
cells. The H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal
import of catalase in vivo and selectively impairs in vitro the interaction of
catalase with the Pex14-Pex5 complex. A phosphomimetic mutant Pex14-S232D
elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins,
conferring higher cell resistance to H2O2. We thus suggest that the H2O2-induced 
phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of
catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the
increase of cytosolic catalase.

Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer
metastasis. Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here 
we identified the pivotal roles of PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling
activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7 exerted its functions through
binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of SHANK2 at
R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain
blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with
SHANK2 on endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal
FAK/cortactin signals in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of
PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397 phosphorylation and cortactin Y421
phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast cancer tissues.
These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key
player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of 
SHANK2 R240 methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular respiration that can
promote oxidative stress and damage cellular proteins and lipids. One canonical
role of ROS is to defend the cell against invading bacterial and viral pathogens.
Curiously, some viruses, including herpesviruses, thrive despite the induction of
ROS, suggesting that ROS are beneficial for the virus. However, the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that ROS impaired interferon response
during murine herpesvirus infection and that the inhibition occurred downstream
of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We further demonstrated that ROS suppressed the type 
I interferon response by oxidizing Cysteine 147 on murine stimulator of
interferon genes (STING), an ER-associated protein that mediates interferon
response after cytoplasmic DNA sensing. This inhibited STING polymerization and
activation of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that redox
regulation of Cysteine 147 of mouse STING, which is equivalent to Cysteine 148 of
human STING, controls interferon production. Together, our findings reveal that
ROS orchestrates anti-viral immune responses, which can be exploited by viruses
to evade cellular defenses.

C1q plays a key role as a recognition molecule in the immune system, driving
autocatalytic complement cascade activation and acting as an opsonin. We have
previously reported a non-immune role of complement C1q modulating the migration 
and fate of human neural stem cells (hNSC); however, the mechanism underlying
these effects has not yet been identified. Here, we show for the first time that 
C1q acts as a functional hNSC ligand, inducing intracellular signaling to control
cell behavior. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we identified five
transmembrane C1q signaling/receptor candidates in hNSC (CD44, GPR62, BAI1,
c-MET, and ADCY5). We further investigated the interaction between C1q and CD44 ,
demonstrating that CD44 mediates C1q induced hNSC signaling and chemotaxis in
vitro, and hNSC migration and functional repair in vivo after spinal cord injury.
These results reveal a receptor-mediated mechanism for C1q modulation of NSC
behavior and show that modification of C1q receptor expression can expand the
therapeutic window for hNSC transplantation.

APOBEC3B (A3B)-catalyzed DNA cytosine deamination contributes to the overall
mutational landscape in breast cancer. Molecular mechanisms responsible for A3B
upregulation in cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that a single E2F
cis-element mediates repression in normal cells and that expression is activated 
by its mutational disruption in a reporter construct or the endogenous A3B gene. 
The same E2F site is required for A3B induction by polyomavirus T antigen
indicating a shared molecular mechanism. Proteomic and biochemical experiments
demonstrate the binding of wildtype but not mutant E2F promoters by repressive
PRC1.6/E2F6 and DREAM/E2F4 complexes. Knockdown and overexpression studies
confirm the involvement of these repressive complexes in regulating A3B
expression. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that A3B expression is
suppressed in normal cells by repressive E2F complexes and that viral or
mutational disruption of this regulatory network triggers overexpression in
breast cancer and provides fuel for tumor evolution.

Aberrant HOXA9 expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias,
notably those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. HOXA9 overexpression not only
predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia
transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9
regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic
strategies. Here, we generated the HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter cell lines to 
dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we
identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel 
regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression
and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9
rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut and Run analysis
revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells.
Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the 
HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation
network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility
and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed
mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis.
Previously, we found that a lncRNA named GAS5 in human could negatively regulate 
the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether
GAS5 affects osteoblast differentiation and whether GAS5 is associated with
osteoporosis. Our current research found that GAS5 was decreased in the bones and
BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically,
GAS5 promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade 
SMAD7 mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were
observed in Gas5 heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic
supplement of Gas5-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone
loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, GAS5 promotes osteoblast
differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against
osteoporosis.

Life of sexually reproducing organisms starts with the fusion of the haploid egg 
and sperm gametes to form the genome of a new diploid organism. Using the newly
fertilized Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, we show that the mitotic Polo-like
kinase PLK-1 phosphorylates the lamin LMN-1 to promote timely lamina disassembly 
and subsequent merging of the parental genomes into a single nucleus after
mitosis. Expression of non-phosphorylatable versions of LMN-1, which affect
lamina depolymerization during mitosis, is sufficient to prevent the mixing of
the parental chromosomes into a single nucleus in daughter cells. Finally, we
recapitulate lamina depolymerization by PLK-1 in vitro demonstrating that LMN-1

is essential for the merging of parental chromosomes at the beginning of life in 
C. elegans and possibly also in humans, where a defect in this process might be
fatal for embryo development.

Meiotic recombination starts with the formation of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) at specific genomic locations that correspond to PRDM9-binding sites. The 
molecular steps occurring from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are unknown. Using 
proteomic approaches to find PRDM9 partners, we identified HELLS, a member of the
SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers. Upon functional analyses during mouse
male meiosis, we demonstrated that HELLS is required for PRDM9 binding and DSB
activity at PRDM9 sites. However, HELLS is not required for DSB activity at
PRDM9-independent sites. HELLS is also essential for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) enrichment at PRDM9 sites. Analyses of 5hmC in mice deficient for SPO11,
which catalyzes DSB formation, and in PRDM9 methyltransferase deficient mice
reveal that 5hmC is triggered at DSB-prone sites upon PRDM9 binding and histone
modification, but independent of DSB activity. These findings highlight the
complex regulation of the chromatin and epigenetic environments at
PRDM9-specified hotspots.

The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although
fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when
sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment
lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental 
handle in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, in which we uncover the
mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that
sustained β-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1,
triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear
transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved
repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual
control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from
life-shortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation.
Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long
periods without deleterious effects on longevity.

Brown adipose tissue is a metabolically beneficial organ capable of dissipating
chemical energy into heat, thereby increasing energy expenditure. Here, we
identify Dot1l, the only known H3K79 methyltransferase, as an interacting partner
of Zc3h10 that transcriptionally activates the Ucp1 promoter and other BAT genes.
Through a direct interaction, Dot1l is recruited by Zc3h10 to the promoter
regions of thermogenic genes to function as a coactivator by methylating H3K79.
We also show that Dot1l is induced during brown fat cell differentiation and by
cold exposure and that Dot1l and its H3K79 methyltransferase activity is required
for thermogenic gene program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dot1l ablation in 
mice using Ucp1-Cre prevents activation of Ucp1 and other target genes to reduce 
thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure, promoting adiposity. Hence, Dot1l
plays a critical role in the thermogenic program and may present as a future
target for obesity therapeutics.

Cell cycle is a cellular process that is subject to stringent control. In
contrast to the wealth of knowledge of proteins controlling the cell cycle, very 
little is known about the molecular role of lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) in
cell-cycle progression. By performing genome-wide transcriptome analyses in
cell-cycle-synchronized cells, we observed cell-cycle phase-specific induction of
>2000 lncRNAs. Further, we demonstrate that an S-phase-upregulated lncRNA, SUNO1,
facilitates cell-cycle progression by promoting YAP1-mediated gene expression.
SUNO1 facilitates the cell-cycle-specific transcription of WTIP, a positive
regulator of YAP1, by promoting the co-activator, DDX5-mediated stabilization of 
RNA polymerase II on chromatin. Finally, elevated SUNO1 levels are associated
with poor cancer prognosis and tumorigenicity, implying its pro-survival role.
Thus, we demonstrate the role of a S-phase up-regulated lncRNA in cell-cycle
progression via modulating the expression of genes controlling cell
proliferation.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often associated with polysomes, indicating
coding potential. However, only a handful of endogenous proteins encoded by
putative lncRNAs have been identified and assigned a function. Here, we report
the discovery of a putative gastrointestinal-tract-specific lncRNA (LINC00675)
that is regulated by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 and encodes a
conserved small protein of 79 amino acids which we termed FORCP (FOXA1-Regulated 
Conserved Small Protein). FORCP transcript is undetectable in most cell types but
is abundant in well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC) cells where it
functions to inhibit proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorigenesis. The
epitope-tagged and endogenous FORCP protein predominantly localizes to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to ER stress, FORCP depletion results in 
decreased apoptosis. Our findings on the initial characterization of FORCP
demonstrate that FORCP is a novel, conserved small protein encoded by a
mis-annotated lncRNA that regulates apoptosis and tumorigenicity in
well-differentiated CRC cells.

Macrophages are critically involved in not only immune and inflammatory responses
but also maintenance of metabolic fitness of organisms. Combined genetic
deficiency of three clusters in the miR-17~92 family drastically shifted
macrophage phenotypes toward the inflammatory spectrum characterized by
heightened production of pro-inflammatory mediator TNF and diminished expression 
of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Consequently, macrophages residing in the
adipose tissues from myeloid-specific miRNA triple knockout mice spontaneously
developed inflammatory phenotypes and displayed alterations of overall
physiological conditions as evidenced by obesity and compromised glucose
tolerance. Mechanistically, miR-17~92 family miRNAs sustained IL-10 production by
promoting transcription of the Fos gene, which is secondary to downregulation of 
Fos by transcription factor YY1, a direct target of miR-17~92 family miRNAs.
Together, these results identified miR-17~92 family miRNAs as crucial regulators 
of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and exemplified how
macrophage-intrinsic regulatory circuit exerted impactful influence on general
physiology.

Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in hepatocytes plays a key role in plasma
clearance of circulating LDL and in whole body cholesterol homeostasis. The
trafficking of LDLR is highly regulated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis,
endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation. Current studies focus on its
endocytosis and degradation. However, the detailed molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying its endosomal recycling are largely unknown. We found that 
BLOS1, a shared subunit of BLOC-1 and BORC, is involved in LDLR endosomal
recycling. Loss of BLOS1 leads to less membrane LDLR and impairs LDL clearance
from plasma in hepatocyte-specific BLOS1 knockout mice. BLOS1 interacts with
kinesin-3 motor KIF13A, and BLOS1 acts as a new adaptor for kinesin-2 motor KIF3 
to coordinate kinesin-3 and kinesin-2 during the long-range transport of
recycling endosomes (REs) to plasma membrane along microtubule tracks to overcome
hurdles at microtubule intersections. This provides new insights into RE's
anterograde transport and the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia.

The palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ZDHHC14 is highly expressed in the
hippocampus and is the only PAT predicted to bind Type-I PDZ domain-containing
proteins. However, ZDHHC14's neuronal roles are unknown. Here, we identify the
PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) PSD93 as a
direct ZDHHC14 interactor and substrate. PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes
to the axon initial segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in
rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS
clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind
PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1
channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14's importance for Kv1 channel clustering,
loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing 
in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first
neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated
role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.

Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies noncanonical NF-κB signaling as a regulator 
of density-dependent proliferation.

Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell
density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such
mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify
genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary
epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based 
on fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator, which marks different stages
of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we
performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that
proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density.
Unexpectedly, one top hit was Traf3, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling that
has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We
demonstrate that loss of Traf3 specifically activates noncanonical NF-κB
signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell
division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms,
including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, by blocking
entry into quiescence.

Casein kinases are a large family of intracellular serine/threonine kinases that 
control a variety of cellular signaling functions. Here we report that a member
of casein kinase 1 family, casein kinase 1G2, CSNK1G2, binds and inhibits the
activation of receptor-interacting kinase 3, RIPK3, thereby attenuating
RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. The binding of CSNK1G2 to RIPK3 is triggered by
auto-phosphorylation at serine 211/threonine 215 sites in its C-terminal domain. 
CSNK1G2-knockout mice showed significantly enhanced necroptosis response and
premature aging of their testis, a phenotype that was rescued by either double
knockout of the Ripk3 gene or feeding the animal with a RIPK1 kinase
inhibitor-containing diet. Moreover, CSNK1G2 is also co-expressed with RIPK3 in
human testis, and the necroptosis activation marker phospho-MLKL was observed in 
the testis of old (>80) but not young men, indicating that the testis-aging
program carried out by the RIPK3-mediated and CSNK1G2-attenuated necroptosis is
evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that degrades
aberrant mRNAs and also regulates the expression of a wide range of physiological
transcripts. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases form an hetero-hexameric ring that is 
part of several macromolecular complexes such as INO80, SWR1, and R2TP.
Interestingly, RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is required for NMD activation by an
unknown mechanism. Here, we show that DHX34, an RNA helicase regulating NMD
initiation, directly interacts with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in vitro and in cells. Cryo-EM 
reveals that DHX34 induces extensive changes in the N-termini of every RUVBL2
subunit in the complex, stabilizing a conformation that does not bind nucleotide 
and thereby down-regulates ATP hydrolysis of the complex. Using ATPase-deficient 
mutants, we find that DHX34 acts exclusively on the RUVBL2 subunits. We propose a
model, where DHX34 acts to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly
of factors required to initiate the NMD response.

Nuclear export of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is intimately coupled to their
synthesis. pre-mRNAs assemble into dynamic ribonucleoparticles as they are being 
transcribed, processed, and exported. The role of ubiquitylation in this process 
is increasingly recognized but, while a few E3 ligases have been shown to
regulate nuclear export, evidence for deubiquitylases is currently lacking. Here 
we identified deubiquitylase Ubp15 as a regulator of nuclear export in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ubp15 interacts with both RNA polymerase II and the
nuclear pore complex, and its deletion reverts the nuclear export defect of E3
ligase Rsp5 mutants. The deletion of UBP15 leads to hyper-ubiquitylation of the
main nuclear export receptor Mex67 and affects its association with THO, a
complex coupling transcription to mRNA processing and involved in the recruitment
of mRNA export factors to nascent transcripts. Collectively, our data support a
role for Ubp15 in coupling transcription to mRNA export.

Wnt signaling is downregulated in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and
contributes to the block of differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms leading to its
suppression are unknown and could pave the way toward novel therapeutic
modalities. We demonstrate that EHMT2 suppresses canonical Wnt signaling by
activating expression of the Wnt antagonist DKK1. Inhibition of EHMT2 expression 
or activity in human ERMS cell lines reduced DKK1 expression and elevated
canonical Wnt signaling resulting in myogenic differentiation in vitro and in
mouse xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, EHMT2 impacted Sp1 and p300
enrichment at the DKK1 promoter. The reduced tumor growth upon EHMT2 deficiency
was reversed by recombinant DKK1 or LGK974, which also inhibits Wnt signaling.
Consistently, among 13 drugs targeting chromatin modifiers, EHMT2 inhibitors were
highly effective in reducing ERMS cell viability. Our study demonstrates that
ERMS cells are vulnerable to EHMT2 inhibitors and suggest that targeting the
EHMT2-DKK1-β-catenin node holds promise for differentiation therapy.

The dendritic cell receptor Clec9A facilitates processing of dead cell-derived
antigens for cross-presentation and the induction of effective CD8+ T cell immune
responses. Here, we show that this process is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase
RNF41 and define a new ubiquitin-mediated mechanism for regulation of Clec9A,
reflecting the unique properties of Clec9A as a receptor specialized for delivery
of antigens for cross-presentation. We reveal RNF41 is a negative regulator of
Clec9A and the cross-presentation of dead cell-derived antigens by mouse
dendritic cells. Intriguingly, RNF41 regulates the downstream fate of Clec9A by
directly binding and ubiquitinating the extracellular domains of Clec9A. At
steady-state, RNF41 ubiquitination of Clec9A facilitates interactions with
ER-associated proteins and degradation machinery to control Clec9A levels.
However, Clec9A interactions are altered following dead cell uptake to favor
antigen presentation. These findings provide important insights into antigen
cross-presentation and have implications for development of approaches to
modulate immune responses.

    Autophagy. 2021 Apr;17(4):1042-1043.

Mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis. In yeast, the
phosphorylation of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 by casein kinase 2 is essential
for mitophagy. This phosphorylation is counteracted by the yeast equivalent of
the STRIPAK complex consisting of the PP2A-like protein phosphatase Ppg1 and
Far3-7-8-9-10-11 (Far complex), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
Here we show that two subpopulations of the Far complex reside in the
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, and play distinct roles;
the former inhibits mitophagy via Atg32 dephosphorylation, and the latter
regulates TORC2 signaling. Ppg1 and Far11 form a subcomplex, and Ppg1 activity is
required for the assembling integrity of Ppg1-Far11-Far8. The Far complex
preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32, and this interaction is
weakened by mitophagy induction. Furthermore, the artificial tethering of Far8 to
Atg32 prevents mitophagy. Taken together, the Ppg1-mediated Far complex formation
and its dissociation from Atg32 are crucial for mitophagy regulation.

Changes in available nutrients are inevitable events for most living organisms.
Upon nutritional stress, several signaling pathways cooperate to change the
transcription program through chromatin regulation to rewire cellular metabolism.
In budding yeast, histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) acts as a
marker of low glucose stress and regulates the transcription of nutritional
stress-responsive genes. Understanding how this histone modification 'senses'
external glucose changes remains elusive. Here, we show that Tda1, the yeast
ortholog of human Nuak1, is a direct kinase for H3pT11 upon low glucose stress.
Yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) directly phosphorylates Tda1 to govern 
Tda1 activity, while CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization. Collectively, AMPK 
and CK2 signaling converge on histone kinase Tda1 to link external low glucose
stress to chromatin regulation.

Endothelial cell (EC) activation is an early hallmark in the pathogenesis of
chronic vascular diseases. MicroRNA-181b (Mir181b) is an important
anti-inflammatory mediator in the vascular endothelium affecting endotoxemia,
atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. Herein, we identify that the drug
methotrexate (MTX) and its downstream metabolite adenosine exert
anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular endothelium by targeting and activating
Mir181b expression. Both systemic and endothelial-specific Mir181a2b2-deficient
mice develop vascular inflammation, white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, and 
insulin resistance in a diet-induced obesity model. Moreover, MTX attenuated
diet-induced WAT inflammation, insulin resistance, and EC activation in a
Mir181a2b2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MTX attenuated cytokine-induced EC 
activation through a unique adenosine-adenosine receptor A3-SMAD3/4-Mir181b
signaling cascade. These findings establish an essential role of endothelial
Mir181b in controlling vascular inflammation and that restoring Mir181b in ECs by
high-dose MTX or adenosine signaling may provide a potential therapeutic
opportunity for anti-inflammatory therapy.

The ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3) is a ciliopathy G-protein which
regulates the ciliary trafficking of several lipid-modified proteins. ARL3 is
activated by its guanine exchange factor (GEF) ARL13B via an unresolved
mechanism. BART is described as an ARL3 effector which has also been implicated
in ciliopathies, although the role of its ARL3 interaction is unknown. Here, we
show that, at physiological GTP:GDP levels, human ARL3GDP is weakly activated by 
ARL13B. However, BART interacts with nucleotide-free ARL3 and, in concert with
ARL13B, efficiently activates ARL3. In addition, BART binds ARL3GTP and inhibits 
GTP dissociation, thereby stabilising the active G-protein; the binding of ARL3
effectors then releases BART. Finally, using live cell imaging, we show that BART
accesses the primary cilium and colocalises with ARL13B. We propose a model
wherein BART functions as a bona fide co-GEF for ARL3 and maintains the active
ARL3GTP, until it is recycled by ARL3 effectors.

The conserved MAP3K Dual-Leucine-Zipper Kinase (DLK) and Leucine-Zipper-bearing
Kinase (LZK) can activate JNK via MKK4 or MKK7. These two MAP3Ks share similar
biochemical activities and undergo auto-activation upon increased expression.
Depending on cell-type and nature of insults DLK and LZK can induce
pro-regenerative, pro-apoptotic or pro-degenerative responses, although the
mechanistic basis of their action is not well understood. Here, we investigated
these two MAP3Ks in cerebellar Purkinje cells using loss- and gain-of function
mouse models. While loss of each or both kinases does not cause discernible
defects in Purkinje cells, activating DLK causes rapid death and activating LZK
leads to slow degeneration. Each kinase induces JNK activation and
caspase-mediated apoptosis independent of each other. Significantly, deleting
CELF2, which regulates alternative splicing of Map2k7, strongly attenuates
Purkinje cell degeneration induced by LZK, but not DLK. Thus, controlling the
activity levels of DLK and LZK is critical for neuronal survival and health.

PARP-7 (TiPARP) is a mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase whose protein substrates and
biological activities are poorly understood. We observed that PARP7 mRNA levels
are lower in ovarian cancer patient samples compared to non-cancerous tissue, but
PARP-7 protein nonetheless contributes to several cancer-related biological
endpoints in ovarian cancer cells (e.g. growth, migration). Global gene
expression analyses in ovarian cancer cells subjected to PARP-7 depletion
indicate biological roles for PARP-7 in cell-cell adhesion and gene regulation.
To identify the MARylated substrates of PARP-7 in ovarian cancer cells, we
developed an NAD+ analog-sensitive approach, which we coupled with mass
spectrometry to identify the PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome in ovarian cancer
cells, including cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins. Specifically, we
found that PARP-7 MARylates α-tubulin to promote microtubule instability, which
may regulate ovarian cancer cell growth and motility. In sum, we identified an
extensive PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome with important roles in cancer-related 
cellular phenotypes.

plain-language-summary: Cancer is a complex illness where changes inside healthy 
cells causes them to grow and reproduce rapidly. Specialized proteins called
enzymes – which regulate chemical reactions in the cell – often help cancer
develop and spread through the body. One such enzyme called PARP-7 labels other
proteins by attaching a chemical group which changes their behavior. However, it 
was unknown which proteins PARP-7 modifies and how this tag alters the actions of
these proteins. To investigate this, Parsons, Challa, Gibson et al. developed a
method to find and identify the proteins labelled by PARP-7 in ovarian cancer
cells taken from patients and cultured in the laboratory. This revealed that
PARP-7 labels hundreds of different proteins, including adhesion proteins which
affect the connections between cells and cytoskeletal proteins which regulate a
cell’s shape and how it moves. One of the cytoskeletal proteins modified by
PARP-7 is α-tubulin, which joins together with other tubulins to form long,
tube-like structures known as microtubules. Parsons et al. found that when
α-tubulin is labelled by PARP-7, it creates unstable microtubules that alter how 
the cancer cells grow and move. They discovered that depleting PARP-7 or mutating
the sites where it modifies α-tubulin increased the stability of microtubules and
slowed the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States. A new drug which
suppresses the activity of PARP-7 has recently been developed, and this drug
could potentially be used to treat ovarian cancer patients with high levels of
PARP-7. Clinical trials are ongoing to see how this drug affects the behavior of 
cancer cells in patients.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 7 (PARP-7) has emerged as a critically important
member of a large enzyme family that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation in mammalian
cells. PARP-7 is a critical regulator of the innate immune response. What remains
unclear is the mechanism by which PARP-7 regulates this process, namely because
the protein targets of PARP-7 mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) are largely
unknown. Here, we combine chemical genetics, proximity labeling, and
proteome-wide amino acid ADP-ribosylation site profiling for identifying the
direct targets and sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation in a cellular context. We 
found that the inactive PARP family member, PARP-13-a critical regulator of the
antiviral innate immune response-is a major target of PARP-7. PARP-13 is
preferentially MARylated on cysteine residues in its RNA binding zinc finger
domain. Proteome-wide ADP-ribosylation analysis reveals cysteine as a major
MARylation acceptor of PARP-7. This study provides insight into PARP-7 targeting 
and MARylation site preference.

In budding yeast, the mitotic exit network (MEN), a GTPase signaling cascade,
integrates spatial and temporal cues to promote exit from mitosis. This signal
integration requires transmission of a signal generated on the cytoplasmic face
of spindle pole bodies (SPBs; yeast equivalent of centrosomes) to the nucleolus, 
where the MEN effector protein Cdc14 resides. Here, we show that the MEN
activating signal at SPBs is relayed to Cdc14 in the nucleolus through the
dynamic localization of its terminal kinase complex Dbf2-Mob1. Cdc15, the protein
kinase that activates Dbf2-Mob1 at SPBs, also regulates its nuclear access. Once 
in the nucleus, priming phosphorylation of Cfi1/Net1, the nucleolar anchor of
Cdc14, by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 targets Dbf2-Mob1 to the nucleolus. Nucleolar
Dbf2-Mob1 then phosphorylates Cfi1/Net1 and Cdc14, activating Cdc14. The
kinase-primed transmission of the MEN signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus 
exemplifies how signaling cascades can bridge distant inputs and responses.

Derived from a common precursor cell, the balance between Th17 and Treg cells
must be maintained within immune system to prevent autoimmune diseases.
IL-1β-mediated IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for Th17-cell
biology. Fine-tuning of IL-1R signaling is controlled by two receptors, IL-1RI
and IL-RII, IL-1R accessory protein, and IL-1R antagonist. We demonstrate that
the decoy receptor, IL-1RII, is important for regulating IL-17 responses in
TCR-stimulated CD4+ T cells expressing functional IL-1RI via limiting IL-1β
responsiveness. IL-1RII expression is regulated by NFAT via its interaction with 
Foxp3. The NFAT/FOXP3 complex binds to the IL-1RII promoter and is critical for
its transcription. Additionally, IL-1RII expression is dysregulated in CD4+ T
cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, differential expression of
IL-1Rs on activated CD4+ T cells defines unique immunological features and a
novel molecular mechanism underlies IL-1RII expression. These findings shed light
on the modulatory effects of IL-1RII on Th17 responses.

The Hippo (Hpo) pathway regulates tissue growth in many animals. Multiple
upstream components promote Hpo pathway activity, but the organization of these
different inputs, the degree of crosstalk between them, and whether they are
regulated in a distinct manner is not well understood. Kibra (Kib) activates the 
Hpo pathway by recruiting the core Hpo kinase cassette to the apical cortex.
Here, we show that the Hpo pathway downregulates Drosophila Kib levels
independently of Yorkie-mediated transcription. We find that Hpo signaling
complex formation promotes Kib degradation via SCFSlimb-mediated ubiquitination, 
that this effect requires Merlin, Salvador, Hpo, and Warts, and that this
mechanism functions independently of other upstream Hpo pathway activators.
Moreover, Kib degradation appears patterned by differences in mechanical tension 
across the wing. We propose that Kib degradation mediated by Hpo pathway
components and regulated by cytoskeletal tension serves to control Kib-driven Hpo
pathway activation and ensure optimally scaled and patterned tissue growth.

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play essential roles in silencing repetitive
elements to promote fertility in metazoans. Studies in worms, flies, and mammals 
reveal that piRNAs are expressed in a sex-specific manner. However, the
mechanisms underlying this sex-specific regulation are unknown. Here we identify 
SNPC-1.3, a male germline-enriched variant of a conserved subunit of the small
nuclear RNA-activating protein complex, as a male-specific piRNA transcription
factor in Caenorhabditis elegans. SNPC-1.3 colocalizes with the core piRNA
transcription factor, SNPC-4, in nuclear foci of the male germline. Binding of
SNPC-1.3 at male piRNA loci drives spermatogenic piRNA transcription and requires
SNPC-4. Loss of snpc-1.3 leads to depletion of male piRNAs and defects in
male-dependent fertility. Furthermore, TRA-1, a master regulator of sex
determination, binds to the snpc-1.3 promoter and represses its expression during
oogenesis. Loss of TRA-1 targeting causes ectopic expression of snpc-1.3 and male
piRNAs during oogenesis. Thus, sexually dimorphic regulation of snpc-1.3
expression coordinates male and female piRNA expression during germline
development.

The regulation of stem cell fate is poorly understood. Genetic studies in
Caenorhabditis elegans lead to the hypothesis that a conserved cytoplasmic
double-negative feedback loop consisting of the RNA-binding protein Trim71 and
the let-7 microRNA controls the pluripotency and differentiation of stem cells.
Although let-7-microRNA-mediated inhibition of Trim71 promotes differentiation,
whether and how Trim71 regulates pluripotency and inhibits the let-7 microRNA are
still unknown. Here, we show that Trim71 represses Ago2 mRNA translation in mouse
embryonic stem cells. Blocking this repression leads to a specific
post-transcriptional increase of mature let-7 microRNAs, resulting in
let-7-dependent stemness defects and accelerated differentiation in the stem
cells. These results not only support the Trim71-let-7-microRNA bi-stable switch 
model in controlling stem cell fate, but also reveal that repressing the
conserved pro-differentiation let-7 microRNAs at the mature microRNA level by
Ago2 availability is critical to maintaining pluripotency.

The committed step of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs when the pairs of Mcm2-7 
replicative helicases that license each replication origin are activated.
Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming
Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to
monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded
Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45, GINS, and likely additional proteins are 
recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase
(DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). DDK
phosphorylation of multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2-7 tails modulates
the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of
CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher
CtG multiplicity increases the frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal
the molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with
implications for control of replication origin efficiency and timing.

The endothelium responds to numerous chemical and mechanical factors in
regulating vascular tone, blood pressure, and blood flow. The endothelial
volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechanosensitive
and thereby sense fluid flow and hydrostatic pressure to regulate vascular
function. Here, we show that the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8a,
LRRC8A (SWELL1), is required for VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs). Endothelial LRRC8A regulates AKT-endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) signaling under basal, stretch, and shear-flow stimulation, forms a
GRB2-Cav1-eNOS signaling complex, and is required for endothelial cell alignment 
to laminar shear flow. Endothelium-restricted Lrrc8a KO mice develop hypertension
in response to chronic angiotensin-II infusion and exhibit impaired retinal blood
flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of type 2 
diabetes (T2D). These data demonstrate that LRRC8A regulates AKT-eNOS in
endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in
the setting of T2D.

Caenorhabditis elegans expresses human Werner syndrome protein (WRN) orthologs as
two distinct proteins: MUT-7, with a 3'-5' exonuclease domain, and CeWRN-1, with 
helicase domains. How these domains cooperate remains unclear. Here, we
demonstrate the different contributions of MUT-7 and CeWRN-1 to 22G small
interfering RNA (siRNA) synthesis and the plasticity of neuronal signaling. MUT-7
acts specifically in the cytoplasm to promote siRNA biogenesis and in the nucleus
to associate with CeWRN-1. The import of siRNA by the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3
promotes the loading of the heterochromatin-binding protein HP1 homolog HPL-2
onto specific loci. This heterochromatin complex represses the gene expression of
the guanylyl cyclase ODR-1 to direct olfactory plasticity in C. elegans. Our
findings suggest that the exonuclease and helicase domains of human WRN may act
in concert to promote RNA-dependent loading into a heterochromatin complex, and
the failure of this entire process reduces plasticity in postmitotic neurons.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates a coordinated
anabolic program in response to growth-promoting signals. Paradoxically, recent
studies indicate that mTORC1 can activate the transcription factor ATF4 through
mechanisms distinct from its canonical induction by the integrated stress
response (ISR). However, its broader roles as a downstream target of mTORC1 are
unknown. Therefore, we directly compared ATF4-dependent transcriptional changes
induced upon insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling to those activated by the ISR.
In multiple mouse embryo fibroblast and human cancer cell lines, the mTORC1-ATF4 
pathway stimulated expression of only a subset of the ATF4 target genes induced
by the ISR, including genes involved in amino acid uptake, synthesis, and tRNA
charging. We demonstrate that ATF4 is a metabolic effector of mTORC1 involved in 
both its established role in promoting protein synthesis and in a previously
unappreciated function for mTORC1 in stimulating cellular cystine uptake and
glutathione synthesis.

plain-language-summary: When building healthy tissue, the human body must
carefully control the growth of new cells to prevent them from becoming
cancerous. A core component of this regulation is the protein mTORC1, which
responds to various growth-stimulating factors and nutrients, and activates the
chemical reactions cells need to grow. Part of this process involves controlling 
‘nutrient-sensing transcription factors’ – proteins that regulate the activity of
specific genes based on the availability of different nutrients. One of these
nutrient-sensing transcription factors, ATF4, has recently been shown to be
involved in some of the processes triggered by mTORC1. The role this factor plays
in how cells respond to stress – such as when specific nutrients are depleted,
protein folding is disrupted or toxins are present – is well-studied. But how it 
reacts to the activation of mTORC1 is less clear. To bridge this gap, Torrence et
al. studied mouse embryonic cells and human prostate cancer cells grown in the
laboratory, to see whether mTORC1 influenced the behavior of ATF4 differently
than cellular stress. Cells were treated either with insulin, which activates
mTORC1, or an antibiotic that sparks the stress response. The cells were then
analyzed using a molecular tool to see which genes were switched on by ATF4
following treatment. This revealed that less than 10% of the genes activated by
ATF4 during cellular stress are also activated in response to mTORC1-driven
growth. Many of the genes activated in both scenarios were involved in
synthesizing and preparing the building blocks that make up proteins. This was
consistent with the discovery that ATF4 helps mTORC1 stimulate growth by
promoting protein synthesis. Torrence et al. also found that mTORC1’s regulation 
of ATF4 stimulated the synthesis of glutathione, the most abundant antioxidant in
cells. The central role mTORC1 plays in controlling cell growth means it is
important to understand how it works and how it can lead to uncontrolled growth
in human diseases. mTORC1 is activated in many overgrowth syndromes and the
majority of human cancers. These new findings could provide insight into how
tumors coordinate their drive for growth while adapting to cellular stress, and
reveal new drug targets for cancer treatment.

Fine control of protein stoichiometry at synapses underlies brain function and
plasticity. How proteostasis is controlled independently for each type of
synaptic protein in a synapse-specific and activity-dependent manner remains
unclear. Here, we show that Susd4, a gene coding for a complement-related
transmembrane protein, is expressed by many neuronal populations starting at the 
time of synapse formation. Constitutive loss-of-function of Susd4 in the mouse
impairs motor coordination adaptation and learning, prevents long-term depression
at cerebellar synapses, and leads to misregulation of activity-dependent AMPA
receptor subunit GluA2 degradation. We identified several proteins with known
roles in the regulation of AMPA receptor turnover, in particular ubiquitin
ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily, as SUSD4 binding partners. Our findings shed
light on the potential role of SUSD4 mutations in neurodevelopmental diseases.

SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that normally potentiates intracellular
signaling by growth factors, antigen receptors, and some cytokines, yet is
frequently mutated in human cancer. Here, we examine the role of SHP2 in the
responses of breast cancer cells to EGF by monitoring phosphoproteome dynamics
when SHP2 is allosterically inhibited by SHP099. The dynamics of phosphotyrosine 
abundance at more than 400 tyrosine residues reveal six distinct response
signatures following SHP099 treatment and washout. Remarkably, in addition to
newly identified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and
PLCγ2, another class of sites shows reduced phosphotyrosine abundance upon SHP2
inhibition. Sites of decreased phospho-abundance are enriched on proteins with
two nearby phosphotyrosine residues, which can be directly protected from
dephosphorylation by the paired SH2 domains of SHP2 itself. These findings
highlight the distinct roles of the scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2 
in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.

Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein 
networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their
major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here, we apply BioID2 proximity
labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key
model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing 
a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane
compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult
cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for
interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1,
implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of
Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the
mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa, or vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our
findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell
proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.

Phytochromes are photoreceptors regulating growth and development in plants.
Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we identified a novel signalling pathway
downstream of the far-red light-sensing phytochrome, phyA, that depends on the
highly conserved CCR4-NOT complex. CCR4-NOT is integral to RNA metabolism in
yeast and animals, but its function in plants is largely unknown. NOT9B, an
Arabidopsis homologue of human CNOT9, is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, and
acts as negative regulator of phyA-specific light signalling when bound to NOT1, 
the scaffold protein of the complex. Light-activated phyA interacts with and
displaces NOT9B from NOT1, suggesting a potential mechanism for light signalling 
through CCR4-NOT. ARGONAUTE 1 and proteins involved in splicing associate with
NOT9B and we show that NOT9B is required for specific phyA-dependent alternative 
splicing events. Furthermore, association with nuclear localised ARGONAUTE 1
raises the possibility that NOT9B and CCR4-NOT are involved in phyA-modulated
gene expression.

plain-language-summary: Place a seedling on a windowsill, and soon you will
notice the fragile stem bending towards the glass to soak in the sun and optimize
its growth. Plants can ‘sense’ light thanks to specialized photoreceptor
molecules: for instance, the phytochrome A is responsible for detecting weak and 
‘far-red’ light from the very edge of the visible spectrum. Once the phytochrome 
has been activated, this message is relayed to the rest of the plant through an
intricate process that requires other molecules. The CCR4-NOT protein complex is 
vital for all plants, animals and fungi, suggesting that it was already present
in early life forms. Here, Schwenk et al. examine whether CCR4-NOT could have
acquired a new role in plants to help them respond to far-red light. Scanning the
genetic information of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the
gene encoding the NOT9 subunit of CCR4-NOT had been duplicated in plants during
evolution. NOT9B, the protein that the new copy codes for, has a docking site
that can attach to both phytochrome A and CCR4-NOT. When NOT9B binds phytochrome 
A, it is released from the CCR4-NOT complex: this could trigger a cascade of
reactions that ultimately changes how A. thaliana responds to far-red light.
Plants that had not enough or too much NOT9B were respectively more or less
responsive to that type of light, showing that the duplication of the gene coding
for this subunit had helped plants respond to certain types of light. The
findings by Schwenk et al. illustrate how existing structures can be repurposed
during evolution to carry new roles. They also provide a deeper understanding of 
how plants optimize their growth, a useful piece of information in a world where 
most people rely on crops as their main source of nutrients.

MicroRNAs mediate precise control of spinal interneuron populations to exert
delicate sensory-to-motor outputs.

Although the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) during embryonic development has been
intensively studied in recent years, their postnatal physiological functions
remain largely unexplored due to inherent difficulties with the presence of
redundant paralogs of the same seed. Thus, it is particularly challenging to
uncover miRNA functions at neural circuit level since animal behaviors would need
to be assessed upon complete loss of miRNA family functions. Here, we focused on 
the neural functions of MiR34/449 that manifests a dynamic expression pattern in 
the spinal cord from embryonic to postnatal stages. Our behavioral assays reveal 
that the loss of MiR34/449 miRNAs perturb thermally induced pain response
thresholds and compromised delicate motor output in mice. Mechanistically,
MiR34/449 directly target Satb1 and Satb2 to fine-tune the precise number of a
sub-population of motor synergy encoder (MSE) neurons. Thus, MiR34/449 fine-tunes
optimal development of Satb1/2on interneurons in the spinal cord, thereby
refining explicit sensory-to-motor circuit outputs.

plain-language-summary: The spinal cord is an information superhighway that
connects the body with the brain. There, circuits of neurons process information 
from the brain before sending commands to muscles to generate movement. Each
spinal cord circuit contains many types of neurons, whose identity is defined by 
the set of genes that are active or ‘expressed’ in each cell. When a gene is
turned on, its DNA sequence is copied to produce a messenger RNA (mRNA), a type
of molecule that the cell then uses as a template to produce a protein. MicroRNAs
(or miRNAs), on the other hand, are tiny RNA molecules that help to regulate gene
expression by binding to and ‘deactivating’ specific mRNAs, stopping them from
being used to make proteins. Mammalian cells contain thousands of types of
microRNAs, many of which have unknown roles: this includes MiR34/449, a group of 
six microRNAs found mainly within the nervous system. By using genetic technology
to delete this family from the mouse genome, Chang et al. now show that MiR34/449
has a key role in regulating spinal cord circuits. The first clue came from
discovering that mice without the MiR34/449 family had unusual posture and a
tendency to walk on tiptoe. The animals were also more sensitive to heat,
flicking their tails away from a heat source more readily than control mice. At a
finer level, the spinal cords of the mutants contained greater numbers of cells
in which two genes, Satb1 and Satb2, were turned on. Compared to their
counterparts in control mice, the Satb1/2-positive neurons also showed
differences in the rest of the genes they expressed. In essence, these neurons
had a different genetic profile in MiR34/449 mutant mice, therefore disrupting
the neural circuit they belong to. Based on these findings, Chang et al. propose 
that in wild-type mice, the MiR34/449 family fine-tunes the expression of Satb1/2
in the spinal cord during development. In doing so, it regulates the formation of
the spinal cord circuits that help to control movement. More generally, these
results provide clues about how miRNAs help to determine cell identities; further
studies could then examine whether other miRNAs contribute to the development and
maintenance of neuronal circuits.

To adapt in an ever-changing environment, cells must integrate physical and
chemical signals and translate them into biological meaningful information
through complex signaling pathways. By combining lipidomic and proteomic
approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that ubiquitin
domain-containing protein 1 (UBTD1) plays a crucial role in both the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation.
On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through
N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the
ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the
ubiquitination of Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) by RNF26 and endolysosome
positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination 
of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the
duration of the EGFR signal. Moreover, we showed that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates
EGFR signaling and induces cell proliferation emphasizing a hitherto unknown
function of UBTD1 in EGFR-driven human cell proliferation.

Disruption of the circadian clock machinery in cancer cells is implicated in
tumor malignancy. Studies on cancer therapy reveal the presence of heterogeneous 
cells, including breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs), in breast tumors. BCSCs
are often characterized by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity,
associated with the malignancy of cancers. In this study, we demonstrated the
negative regulation of ALDH activity by the major circadian component CLOCK in
murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The expression of CLOCK was repressed in
high-ALDH-activity 4T1, and enhancement of CLOCK expression abrogated their
stemness properties, such as tumorigenicity and invasive potential. Furthermore, 
reduced expression of CLOCK in high-ALDH-activity 4T1 was post-transcriptionally 
regulated by microRNA: miR-182. Knockout of miR-182 restored the expression of
CLOCK, resulted in preventing tumor growth. Our findings suggest that increased
expression of CLOCK in BCSCs by targeting post-transcriptional regulation
overcame stemness-related malignancy and may be a novel strategy for breast
cancer treatments.
